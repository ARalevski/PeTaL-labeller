Auxin and ROP GTPase Signaling of Polar Nuclear Migration in Root Epidermal Hair Cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> nuclear migration is crucial during the development of diverse eukaryotes. In plants, root hair growth requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> nuclear migration into the outgrowing hair. However, knowledge about the dynamics and the regulatory mechanisms underlying nuclear movements in root epidermal cells remains limited. Here, we show that both auxin and Rho-of-Plant (ROP) signaling modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> nuclear position at the inner epidermal plasma membrane domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ed to the cortical cells during cell elongation as well as subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> nuclear movement to the outer domain into the emerging hair bulge in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Auxin signaling via the nuclear AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE ACETIC ACID7 pathway ensures correct nuclear placement toward the inner membrane domain. Moreover, precise inner nuclear placement relies on SPIKE1 Rho-GEF, SUPERCENTIPEDE1 Rho-GDI, and ACTIN7 (ACT7) function and to a lesser extent on VTI11 vacuolar SNARE activity. Strikingly, the directionality and/or velocity of outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> nuclear migration into the hair outgrowth along actin strands also are ACT7 dependent, auxin sensitive, and regulated by ROP signaling. Thus, our findings provide a founding framework revealing auxin and ROP signaling of inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> nuclear position with some contribution by vacuolar morphology and of actin-dependent outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> nuclear migration in root epidermal hair cells.</p>

Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> behaviors in response to directional and nondirectional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic behaviors is well understood, but it is less well understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental programming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

A MicroRNA93–Interferon Regulatory Factor-9–Immunoresponsive Gene-1–Itaconic Acid Pathway Modulates M2-Like Macrophage Polarization to Revascularize Ischemic Muscle
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Currently, no therapies exist for treating and improving outcomes in patients with severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). MicroRNA93 (miR93) has been shown to favorably modulate angiogenesis and to reduce tissue loss in genetic PAD models. However, the cell-specific function, downstream mechanisms, or signaling involved in miR93-mediated ischemic muscle neovascularization is not clear. Macrophages were best known to modulate arteriogenic response in PAD, and the extent of arteriogenic response induced by macrophages is dependent on greater M2 to M1 activation/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization state. In the present study, we identified a novel mechanism by which miR93 regulates macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization to promote angiogenesis and arteriogenesis to revascularize ischemic muscle in experimental PAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro (macrophages, endothelial cells, skeletal muscle cells under normal and hypoxia serum starvation conditions) and in vivo experiments in preclinical PAD models (unilateral femoral artery ligation and resection) were conducted to examine the role of miR93-interferon regulatory factor-9–immunoresponsive gene-1 (IRG1)–itaconic acid pathway in macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization, angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vivo, compared with wild-type controls, miR106b-93-25 cluster–deficient mice (miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup>) showed decreased angiogenesis and arteriogenesis correlating with increased M1-like macrophages after experimental PAD. Intramuscular delivery of miR93 in miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> PAD mice increased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and the extent of perfusion, which correlated with more M2-like macrophages in the proximal and distal hind-limb muscles. In vitro, miR93 promotes and sustains M2-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization even under M1-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>izing conditions (hypoxia serum starvation). Delivery of bone marrow–derived macrophages from miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> to wild-type ischemic muscle decreased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion, whereas transfer of wild-type macrophages to miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> had the opposite effect. Systematic analysis of top differentially upregulated genes from RNA sequencing between miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type ischemic muscle showed that miR93 regulates IRG1 function to modulate itaconic acid production and macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization. The 3′ untranslated region luciferase assays performed to determine whether IRG1 is a direct target of miR93 revealed that IRG1 is not an miR93 target but that interferon regulatory factor-9, which can regulate IRG1 expression, is an miR93 target. In vitro, increased expression of interferon regulatory factor-9 and IRG1 and itaconic acid treatment significantly decreased endothelial angiogenic potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>miR93 inhibits interferon regulatory factor-9 to decrease IRG1–itaconic acid production to induce M2-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization in ischemic muscle to enhance angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery in experimental PAD.</p></sec>

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in angiosperms, rapid tip growth in pollen tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton within the pollen tube plays a crucial role in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ized process. However, the mechanism underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in pollen tube growth remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-organizing protein, Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls pollen tube growth by modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity and distribution of the F-actin array. The rice <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal pollen tube growth and a decreased germination rate of the pollen grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> pollen tubes display a disorganized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity during tip growth. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the rice pollen tube, which is essential for pollen tube growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity as well as F-actin organization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during rice pollen tube growth. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of pollen tube growth via modulating F-actin organization and array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ation in rice. This work provides insights into tip-focused cell growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity.</p>

Polar Localization of the Borate Exporter BOR1 Requires AP2-Dependent Endocytosis
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element in plants but is toxic when it accumulates to high levels. In root cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the borate exporter BOR1 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ly localized in the plasma membrane toward the stele side for directional transport of B. Upon high-B supply, BOR1 is rapidly internalized and degraded in the vacuole. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> localization and B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 are mediated by endocytosis from the plasma membrane. To dissect the endocytic pathways mediating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> localization and vacuolar sorting, we investigated the contribution of the clathrin adaptor protein, ADAPTOR PROTEIN2 (AP2) complex, to BOR1 trafficking. In the mutants lacking µ- or σ-subunits of the AP2 complex, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> localization and constitutive endocytosis of BOR1 under low-B conditions were dramatically disturbed. A coimmunoprecipitation assay showed association of the AP2 complex with BOR1, while it was independent of YxxΦ sorting motifs, which are in a cytosolic loop of BOR1. A yeast two-hybrid assay supported the interaction of the AP2 complex µ-subunit with the C-terminal tail but not with the YxxΦ motifs in the cytosolic loop of BOR1. Intriguingly, lack of the AP2 subunit did not affect the B-induced rapid internalization/vacuolar sorting of BOR1. Consistent with defects in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> localization, the AP2 complex mutants showed hypersensitivity to B deficiency. Our results indicate that AP2-dependent endocytosis maintains the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> localization of BOR1 to support plant growth under low-B conditions, whereas the B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 is mediated through an AP2-independent endocytic pathway.</p>

Global mRNA polarization regulates translation efficiency in the intestinal epithelium
<p>Asymmetric messenger RNA (mRNA) localization facilitates efficient translation in cells such as neurons and fibroblasts. However, the extent and importance of mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization in epithelial tissues are unclear. Here, we used single-molecule transcript imaging and subcellular transcriptomics to uncover global apical-basal intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization of mRNA in the mouse intestinal epithelium. The localization of mRNAs did not generally overlap protein localization. Instead, ribosomes were more abundant on the apical sides, and apical transcripts were consequently more efficiently translated. Refeeding of fasted mice elicited a basal-to-apical shift in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, which was associated with a specific boost in their translation.

RopGEF1 Plays a Critical Role in Polar Auxin Transport in Early Development
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> auxin transport, facilitated by the combined activities of auxin influx and efflux carriers to maintain asymmetric auxin distribution, is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>RopGEF1</i>, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs), is critically involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> distribution of auxin influx carrier AUX1 and differential accumulation of efflux carriers PIN7 and PIN2 and is important for embryo and early seedling development when RopGEF1 is prevalently expressed. Knockdown or knockout of <i>RopGEF1</i> induces embryo defects, cotyledon vein breaks, and delayed root gravity responses. Altered expression from the auxin response reporter <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in the root pole of <i>RopGEF1</i>-deficient embryos and loss of asymmetric distribution of <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in their gravistimulated root tips suggest that auxin distribution is affected in <i>ropgef1</i> mutants. This is reflected by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity of AUX1 being altered in <i>ropgef1</i> embryos and roots, shifting from the normal apical membrane location to a basal location in embryo central vascular and root protophloem cells and also reduced PIN7 accumulation at embryos and altered PIN2 distribution in gravistimulated roots of mutant seedlings. In establishing that RopGEF1 is critical for AUX1 localization and PIN differential accumulation, our results reveal a role for RopGEF1 in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> auxin transport whereby it imapcts auxin-mediated plant growth and development.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Separation of enantiomers by their enantiospecific interaction with achiral magnetic substrates
<p>It is commonly assumed that recognition and discrimination of chirality, both in nature and in artificial systems, depend solely on spatial effects. However, recent studies have suggested that charge redistribution in chiral molecules manifests an enantiospecific preference in electron spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ation. We therefore reasoned that the induced spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization may affect enantiorecognition through exchange interactions. Here we show experimentally that the interaction of chiral molecules with a perpendicularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ized substrate is enantiospecific. Thus, one enantiomer adsorbs preferentially when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic dipole is pointing up, whereas the other adsorbs faster for the opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization. The interaction is not controlled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field per se, but rather by the electron spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ations, and opens prospects for a distinct approach to enantiomeric separations.</p>

We found that dispersions and gels of para<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with chiral distortions of the crystal lattices exhibited chiroptical activity in the visible range that was 10 times as strong as that of nonpara<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic nanoparticles of comparable size. Transparency of the nanoparticle gels to circularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ized light beams in the ultraviolet range was reversibly modulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields. These phenomena were also observed for other nanoscale metal oxides with lattice distortions from imprinted amino acids and other chiral ligands. The large family of chiral ceramic nanostructures and gels can be pivotal for new technologies and knowledge at the nexus of chirality and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ism.</p>

Defibrillation of soft porous metal-organic frameworks with electric fields
<p>Gas transport through metal-organic framework membranes (MOFs) was switched in situ by applying an external electric field (E-field). The switching of gas permeation upon E-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization could be explained by the structural transformation of the zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 into polymorphs with more rigid lattices. Permeation measurements under a direct-current E-field poling of 500 volts per millimeter showed reversibly controlled switching of the ZIF-8 into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> polymorphs, which was confirmed by x-ray diffraction and ab initio calculations. The stiffening of the lattice causes a reduction in gas transport through the membrane and sharpens the molecular sieving capability. Dielectric spectroscopy, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization, and deuterium nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance studies revealed low-frequency resonances of ZIF-8 that we attribute to lattice flexibility and linker movement. Upon E-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization, we observed a defibrillation of the different lattice motions.</p>

Saturn’s magnetic field revealed by the Cassini Grand Finale
<p>During 2017, the Cassini fluxgate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometer made in situ measurements of Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field at distances ~2550 ± 1290 kilometers above the 1-bar surface during 22 highly inclined Grand Finale orbits. These observations refine the extreme axisymmetry of Saturn’s internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field and show displacement of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic equator northward from the planet’s physical equator. Persistent small-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic structures, corresponding to high-degree (>3) axisymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic moments, were observed. This suggests secondary shallow dynamo action in the semiconducting region of Saturn’s interior. Some high-degree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic moments could arise from strong high-latitude concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic flux within the planet’s deep dynamo. A strong field-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ed current (FAC) system is located between Saturn and the inner edge of its D-ring, with strength comparable to the high-latitude auroral FACs.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> auxin transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

SHADE AVOIDANCE 4 Is Required for Proper Auxin Distribution in the Hypocotyl
<p>The phytohormone auxin is involved in virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. Through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> auxin transport, auxin gradients can be established, which then direct plant differentiation and growth. Shade avoidance responses are well-known processes that require <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> auxin transport. In this study, we have identified a mutant, <i>shade avoidance 4</i> (<i>sav4</i>), defective in shade-induced hypocotyl elongation and basipetal auxin transport. <i>SAV4</i> encodes an unknown protein with armadillo repeat- and tetratricopeptide repeat-like domains known to provide protein-protein interaction surfaces. C terminally yellow fluorescent protein-tagged SAV4 localizes to both the plasma membrane and the nucleus. Membrane-localized SAV4 displays a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> association with the shootward plasma membrane domain in hypocotyl and root cells, which appears to be necessary for its function in hypocotyl elongation. Cotransfection of SAV4 and ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) auxin transporter in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) revealed that SAV4 blocks ABCB1-mediated auxin efflux. We thus propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ly localized SAV4 acts to inhibit ABCB-mediated auxin efflux toward shoots and facilitates the establishment of proper auxin gradients.</p>

A Framework for Lateral Membrane Trafficking and Polar Tethering of the PEN3 ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter
<p>The outermost cell layer of plants, the epidermis, and its outer (lateral) membrane domain facing the environment are continuously challenged by biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, the epidermis and the outer membrane domain provide important selective and protective barriers. However, only a small number of specifically outer membrane-localized proteins are known. Similarly, molecular mechanisms underlying the trafficking and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> placement of outer membrane domain proteins require further exploration. Here, we demonstrate that ACTIN7 (ACT7) mediates trafficking of the PENETRATION3 (PEN3) outer membrane protein from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane in the root epidermis of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and that actin function contributes to PEN3 endocytic recycling. In contrast to such generic ACT7-dependent trafficking from the TGN, the EXOCYST84b (EXO84b) tethering factor mediates PEN3 outer-membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity. Moreover, precise EXO84b placement at the outer membrane domain itself requires ACT7 function. Hence, our results uncover spatially and mechanistically distinct requirements for ACT7 function during outer lateral membrane cargo trafficking and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity establishment. They further identify an exocyst tethering complex mediator of outer lateral membrane cargo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity.</p>

Dynamic response and hydrodynamics of polarized crowds

Distinguishing a Majorana zero mode using spin-resolved measurements

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years.

Lgl reduces endosomal vesicle acidification and Notch signaling by promoting the interaction between Vap33 and the V-ATPase complex
<p>Epithelial cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity is linked to the control of tissue growth and tumorigenesis. The tumor suppressor and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity protein lethal-2-giant larvae (Lgl) promotes Hippo signaling and inhibits Notch signaling to restrict tissue growth in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Notch signaling is greater in <i>lgl</i> mutant tissue than in wild-type tissue because of increased acidification of endosomal vesicles, which promotes the proteolytic processing and activation of Notch by γ-secretase. We showed that the increased Notch signaling and tissue growth defects of <i>lgl</i> mutant tissue depended on endosomal vesicle acidification mediated by the vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase). Lgl promoted the activity of the V-ATPase by interacting with Vap33 (VAMP-associated protein of 33 kDa). Vap33 physically and genetically interacted with Lgl and V-ATPase subunits and repressed V-ATPase–mediated endosomal vesicle acidification and Notch signaling. Vap33 overexpression reduced the abundance of the V-ATPase component Vha44, whereas Lgl knockdown reduced the binding of Vap33 to the V-ATPase component Vha68-3. Our data indicate that Lgl promotes the binding of Vap33 to the V-ATPase, thus inhibiting V-ATPase–mediated endosomal vesicle acidification and thereby reducing γ-secretase activity, Notch signaling, and tissue growth. Our findings implicate the deregulation of Vap33 and V-ATPase activity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity-impaired epithelial cancers.</p>

Arbitrary spin-to–orbital angular momentum conversion of light
<p>Optical elements that convert the spin angular momentum (SAM) of light into vortex beams have found applications in classical and quantum optics. These elements—SAM-to–orbital angular momentum (OAM) converters—are based on the geometric phase and only permit the conversion of left- and right-circular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>izations (spin states) into states with opposite OAM. We present a method for converting arbitrary SAM states into total angular momentum states characterized by a superposition of independent OAM. We designed a metasurface that converts left- and right-circular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>izations into states with independent values of OAM and designed another device that performs this operation for elliptically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ized states. These results illustrate a general material-mediated connection between SAM and OAM of light and may find applications in producing complex structured light and in optical communication.</p>

A molecular spin-photovoltaic device
<p>We fabricated a C<sub>60</sub> fullerene–based molecular spin-photovoltaic device that integrates a photovoltaic response with the spin transport across the molecular layer. The photovoltaic response can be modified under the application of a small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ophotovoltage of up to 5% at room temperature. Device functionalities include a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic current inverter and the presence of diverging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ocurrent at certain illumination levels that could be useful for sensing. Completely spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ized currents can be created by balancing the external partially spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ized injection with the photogenerated carriers.</p>

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields of solar-type stars are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the turbulent convective layers of stars and have a complex dependency upon stellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion rate. We have performed a set of turbulent global simulations that exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic cycles varying systematically with stellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and luminosity. We find that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion on turbulent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type stars.</p>

External rotation of the femoral component increases asymmetry of the posterior condyles
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The morphometry of the distal femur was largely studied to improve   bone-implant fit in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), but little is   known about the asymmetry of the posterior condyles.

A dynamic cell adhesion surface regulates tissue architecture in growth plate cartilage
<p>The architecture and morphogenetic properties of tissues are founded in the tissue-specific regulation of cell behaviors. In endochondral bones, the growth plate cartilage promotes bone elongation via regulated chondrocyte maturation within an ordered, three-dimensional cell array. A key event in the process that generates this cell array is the transformation of disordered resting chondrocytes into clonal columns of discoid proliferative cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ed with the primary growth vector. Previous analysis showed that column-forming chondrocytes display planar cell divisions, and the resulting daughter cells rearrange by ∼90° to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong> with the lengthening column. However, these previous studies provided limited information about the mechanisms underlying this dynamic process. Here we present new mechanistic insights generated by application of a novel time-lapse confocal microscopy method along with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We show that, during cell division, daughter chondrocytes establish a cell-cell adhesion surface enriched in cadherins and β-catenin. Rearrangement into columns occurs concomitant with expansion of this adhesion surface in a process more similar to cell spreading than to migration. Column formation requires cell-cell adhesion, as reducing cadherin binding via chelation of extracellular calcium inhibits chondrocyte rearrangement. Importantly, physical indicators of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ity, such as cell body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment, are not prerequisites for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ed cell behavior. Our results support a model in which regulation of adhesive surface dynamics and cortical tension by extrinsic signaling modifies the thermodynamic landscape to promote organization of daughter cells in the context of the three-dimensional growth plate tissue.</p>

Magneto-Seebeck tunneling on the atomic scale
<p>The tunneling of spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ized electrons across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic tunnel junction driven by a temperature gradient is a fundamental process for the thermal control of electron spin transport. We experimentally investigated the atomic-scale details of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>o-Seebeck tunneling by placing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic probe tip in close proximity to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic sample at cryogenic temperature, with a vacuum as the tunneling barrier. Heating the tip and measuring the thermopower of the junction while scanning across the spin texture of the sample lead to spin-resolved Seebeck coefficients that can be mapped at atomic-scale lateral resolution. We propose a spin detector for spintronics applications that is driven solely by waste heat, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>o-Seebeck tunneling to convert spin information into a voltage that can be used for further data processing.</p>

Emergence of coexisting ordered states in active matter systems
<p>Active systems can produce a far greater variety of ordered patterns than conventional equilibrium systems. In particular, transitions between disorder and either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>- or nematically ordered phases have been predicted and observed in two-dimensional active systems. However, coexistence between phases of different types of order has not been reported. We demonstrate the emergence of dynamic coexistence of ordered states with fluctuating nematic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong> symmetry in an actomyosin motility assay. Combining experiments with agent-based simulations, we identify sufficiently weak interactions that lack a clear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment symmetry as a prerequisite for coexistence. Thus, the symmetry of macroscopic order becomes an emergent and dynamic property of the active system. These results provide a pathway by which living systems can express different types of order by using identical building blocks.</p>

Quantized chiral edge conduction on domain walls of a magnetic topological insulator
<p>Electronic ordering in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic and dielectric materials forms domains with different signs of order parameters. The control of configuration and motion of the domain walls (DWs) enables nonvolatile responses against minute external fields. Here, we realize chiral edge states (CESs) on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic DWs of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic topological insulator. We design and fabricate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic domains in the quantum anomalous Hall state with the tip of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic force microscope and prove the existence of the chiral one-dimensional edge conduction along the prescribed DWs through transport measurements. The proof-of-concept devices based on reconfigurable CESs and Landauer-Buttiker formalism are realized for multiple-domain configurations with well-defined DW channels. Our results may lead to the realization of low-power-consumption spintronic devices.</p>

All-oxide–based synthetic antiferromagnets exhibiting layer-resolved magnetization reversal
<p>Synthesizing antiferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s with correlated oxides has been challenging, owing partly to the markedly degraded ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ism of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic layer at nanoscale thicknesses. Here we report on the engineering of an antiferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic interlayer exchange coupling (AF-IEC) between ultrathin but ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic La<sub>2/3</sub>Ca<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> layers across an insulating CaRu<sub>1/2</sub>Ti<sub>1/2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> spacer. The layer-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic switching leads to sharp steplike hysteresis loops with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization plateaus depending on the repetition number of the stacking bilayers. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization configurations can be switched at moderate fields of hundreds of oersted. Moreover, the AF-IEC can also be realized with an alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic layer of La<sub>2/3</sub>Sr<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> that possesses a Curie temperature near room temperature. The findings will add functionalities to devices with correlated-oxide interfaces.</p>

The magnetic field and turbulence of the cosmic web measured using a brilliant fast radio burst
<p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events thought to originate beyond the Milky Way galaxy. Uncertainty surrounding the burst sources, and their propagation through intervening plasma, has limited their use as cosmological probes. We report on a mildly dispersed (dispersion measure 266.5 ± 0.1 parsecs per cubic centimeter), exceptionally intense (120 ± 30 janskys), linearly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ized, scintillating burst (FRB 150807) that we directly localize to 9 square arc minutes.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Functional Specialization of Cellulose Synthase Isoforms in a Moss Shows Parallels with Seed Plants
<p>The secondary cell walls of tracheary elements and fibers are rich in cellulose microfibrils that are helically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ed and laterally aggregated. Support cells within the leaf midribs of mosses deposit cellulose-rich secondary cell walls, but their biosynthesis and microfibril organization have not been examined. Although the <i>Cellulose Synthase</i> (<i>CESA</i>) gene families of mosses and seed plants diversified independently, <i>CESA</i> knockout analysis in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> revealed parallels with Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in CESA functional specialization, with roles for both subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization. The similarities include regulatory uncoupling of the CESAs that synthesize primary and secondary cell walls, a requirement for two or more functionally distinct CESA isoforms for secondary cell wall synthesis, interchangeability of some primary and secondary CESAs, and some CESA redundancy. The cellulose-deficient midribs of <i>ppcesa3/8</i> knockouts provided negative controls for the structural characterization of stereid secondary cell walls in wild type <i>P. patens</i>. Sum frequency generation spectra collected from midribs were consistent with cellulose microfibril aggregation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong></span></strong>ization microscopy revealed helical microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ation only in wild type leaves. Thus, stereid secondary walls are structurally distinct from primary cell walls, and they share structural characteristics with the secondary walls of tracheary elements and fibers. We propose a mechanism for the convergent evolution of secondary walls in which the deposition of aggregated and helically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ed microfibrils is coupled to rapid and highly localized cellulose synthesis enabled by regulatory uncoupling from primary wall synthesis.</p>

The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau.

From 100°, femoral external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion was observed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was observed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The measure kinematic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial pivoting pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°.

Inspired by a theoretical prediction of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ically doped topological insulator thin films, <bold>Chang <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 167, published online 14 March; see the Perspective by <bold>Oh</bold>) prepared thin films of the compound Cr0.15(Bi0.1Sb0.9)1.85Te3, with Cr as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic dopant. They observed a plateau in the Hall resistance as a function of the gating voltage without any applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields, signifying the achievement of the QAH state.</p></sec>

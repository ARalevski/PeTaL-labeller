Spectral narrowing of x-ray pulses for precision spectroscopy with nuclear resonances
<p>Spectroscopy of nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances offers a wide range of applications due to the remarkable energy resolution afforded by their narrow linewidths. However, progress toward higher resolution is inhibited at modern x-ray sources because they deliver only a tiny fraction of the photons on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance, with the remainder contributing to an off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant background. We devised an experimental setup that uses the fast mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant target to manipulate the spectrum of a given x-ray pulse and to redistribute off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant spectral intensity onto the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance. As a consequence, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant pulse brilliance is increased while the off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant background is reduced. Because our method is compatible with existing and upcoming pulsed x-ray sources, we anticipate that this approach will find applications that require ultranarrow x-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances.</p>

Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s could enable engineering of powerful new cellular behaviors. Rational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> design would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> architectures. In this study, we show that engineered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to generate regulatory cascades, binary logic gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally designed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene. Because CHOMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s can perform complex functions yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic integration, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> engineering for biotechnological applications.</p>

Quantum correlations from a room-temperature optomechanical cavity
<p>The act of position measurement alters the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of an object being measured. This quantum measurement backaction is typically much smaller than the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of a room-temperature object and thus difficult to observe. By shining laser light through a nanomechanical beam, we measure the beam’s thermally driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ions and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong> its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> with optical force fluctuations at a level dictated by the Heisenberg measurement-disturbance uncertainty relation. We demonstrate a cross-correlation technique to distinguish optically driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> from thermally driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, observing this quantum backaction signature up to room temperature. We use the scale of the quantum correlations, which is determined by fundamental constants, to gauge the size of thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, demonstrating a path toward absolute thermometry with quantum mechanically calibrated ticks.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p>Plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in plastid biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a plastid-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the plastid-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. Plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation provides a rational template to implement plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>latory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong>-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong>-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations induced by different environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ations. We conclude that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Oncogenic RAS isoforms show a hierarchical requirement for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS2 to mediate cell transformation
<p>About a third of tumors have activating mutations in <i>HRAS</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, or <i>KRAS</i>, genes encoding guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) of the RAS family. In these tumors, wild-type RAS cooperates with mutant RAS to promote downstream effector activation and cell proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation, suggesting that upstream activators of wild-type RAS are important modulators of mutant RAS-driven oncogenesis. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SOS1 mediates KRAS-driven proliferation, but little is understood about the role of SOS2. We found that RAS family members have a hierarchical requirement for the expression and activity of SOS2 to drive cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), SOS2 critically mediated mutant KRAS-driven, but not HRAS-driven, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation. <i>Sos2</i> deletion reduced epidermal growth factor (EGF)–dependent activation of wild-type HRAS and phosphorylation of the kinase AKT in cells expressing mutant RAS isoforms. Assays using pharmacological inhibitors revealed a hierarchical requirement for signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in promoting RAS-driven cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation that mirrored the requirement for SOS2. KRAS-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation required the GEF activity of SOS2 and was restored in <i>Sos2</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> MEFs by expression of constitutively activated PI3K. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <i>SOS2</i> reduced EGF-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and synergized with MEK inhibition to revert the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed phenotype of human <i>KRAS</i> mutant pancreatic and lung tumor cells. These results indicate that SOS2-dependent PI3K signaling mediates mutant KRAS-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation, revealing therapeutic targets in KRAS-driven cancers. Our data also reveal the importance of three-dimensional culture systems in investigating the mediators of mutant KRAS.</p>

Voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into smooth muscle during contraction promotes endothelium-mediated feedback vasodilation in arterioles
<p>Vascular smooth muscle contraction is suppressed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> dilation mediated by the endothelium. In skeletal muscle arterioles, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> can be activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals passing from smooth muscle through gap junctions to endothelial cells, which protrude through holes in the internal elastic lamina to make contact with vascular smooth muscle cells. Although hypothetically either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) may provide the intercellular signal, it is generally thought that IP<sub>3</sub> diffusion is responsible. We provide evidence that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCCs) in vascular smooth muscle can pass to the endothelium through positions aligned with holes in the internal elastic lamina in amounts sufficient to activate endothelial cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. In endothelial cells in which IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs) were blocked, VDCC-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were transient and localized to the endothelium that protrudes through the internal elastic lamina to contact vascular smooth muscle cells. In endothelial cells in which IP<sub>3</sub>Rs were not blocked, VDCC-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in endothelial cells were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed to form propagating waves. These waves activated voltage-insensitive, intermediate-conductance, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (IK<sub>Ca</sub>) channels, thereby providing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> that effectively suppressed vasoconstriction and enabled cycles of constriction and dilation called vaso<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>. Thus, agonists that stimulate vascular smooth muscle depolarization provide Ca<sup>2+</sup> to endothelial cells to activate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that protects tissue blood flow.</p>

Observation and stabilization of photonic Fock states in a hot radio-frequency resonator

In quantum optics, the ultimate limit of a weak field is a single photon.

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator
<p>In metals, orbital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in magnetic fields, which is manifested by quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in electrical resistivity.

Effects of network modularity on the spread of perturbation impact in experimental metapopulations
<p>Networks with a modular structure are expected to have a lower risk of global failure. However, this theoretical result has remained untested until now.

We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ed one local population and measured the spread of the impact of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation, both within and between modules. Our results show the buffering capacity of modular networks. To assess the generality of our findings, we then analyzed a dynamical model of our system. We show that in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ations, modularity is negatively correlated with metapopulation size. However, even when a small local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation occurs, this negative effect is offset by a buffering effect that protects the majority of the nodes from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation.</p>

Plant-soil feedbacks and mycorrhizal type influence temperate forest population dynamics

However, the factors regulating plant-soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong>, which varies from positive to negative among plant species, remain uncertain. In a large-scale study involving 55 species and 550 populations of North American trees, the type of mycorrhizal association explained much of the variation in plant-soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong>s. In soil collected beneath conspecifics, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees experienced negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong>, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees displayed positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong>. Additionally, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees exhibited strong conspecific inhibition at multiple spatial scales, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees exhibited conspecific facilitation locally and less severe conspecific inhibition regionally. These results suggest that mycorrhizal type, through effects on plant-soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong>s, could be an important contributor to population regulation and community structure in temperate forests.</p>

Plant-soil feedback and the maintenance of diversity in Mediterranean-climate shrublands

We grew 16 co-occurring plant species with contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies from hyperdiverse Australian shrublands and exposed them to soil biota from under their own or other plant species. Plant responses to soil biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> for ectomycorrhizal plants and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal plants.

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator is different from the average plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Complex signal processing in synthetic gene circuits using cooperative regulatory assemblies
<p>Eukaryotic genes are regulated by multivalent transcription factor complexes.

In this study, we apply this design principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative assemblies can program nonlinear gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying the strength and number of assembly subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and nonlinear regulatory responses for single- and multi-input <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping

The MtDMI2-MtPUB2 Negative Feedback Loop Plays a Role in Nodulation Homeostasis
<p>DOES NOT MAKE INFECTION 2 (MtDMI2) is a Leu rich repeat-type receptor kinase required for signal transduction in the <i>Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> symbiosis pathway. However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in nodulation homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel plant U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulation were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of plants in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi plants) exhibited impaired infection threads, fewer nodules, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer nodules than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitination activity, and their nodulation phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> loop of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> loop, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulation of nodulation via MtNIN, plays an important role in nodulation homeostasis.</p>

DELLA-GAF1 Complex Is a Main Component in Gibberellin Feedback Regulation of GA20 Oxidase 2
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that regulate many aspects of plant growth and development, including germination, elongation, flowering, and floral development. Negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> regulation contributes to homeostasis of the GA level. DELLAs are negative regulators of GA signaling and are rapidly degraded in the presence of GAs. DELLAs regulate many target genes, including <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), encoding the GA-biosynthetic enzyme GA 20-oxidase. As DELLAs do not have an apparent DNA-binding motif, transcription factors that act in association with DELLA are necessary for regulating the target genes. Previous studies have identified GAI-ASSOCIATED FACTOR1 (GAF1) as such a DELLA interactor, with which DELLAs act as coactivators, and <i>AtGA20ox2</i> was identified as a target gene of the DELLA-GAF1 complex. In this study, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that four GAF1-binding sites exist in the <i>AtGA20ox2</i> promoter. Using transgenic plants, we further evaluated the contribution of the DELLA-GAF1 complex to GA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> regulation. Mutations in four GAF1-binding sites abolished the negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> of <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in transgenic plants. Our results showed that GAF1-binding sites are necessary for GA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> regulation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>, suggesting that the DELLA-GAF1 complex is a main component of the GA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> regulation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>.</p>

Cytosolic DNA Sensing Promotes Macrophage Transformation and Governs Myocardial Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardium irreversibly injured by ischemic stress must be efficiently repaired to maintain tissue integrity and contractile performance. Macrophages play critical roles in this process. These cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong> across a spectrum of phenotypes to accomplish diverse functions ranging from mediating the initial inflammatory responses that clear damaged tissue to subsequent reparative functions that help rebuild replacement tissue.

Animals lacking cyclic GMP-AMP synthase display significantly improved early survival after myocardial infarction and diminished pathological remodeling, including ventricular rupture, enhanced angiogenesis, and preserved ventricular contractile function. Furthermore, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase loss of function abolishes the induction of key inflammatory programs such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and promotes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation of macrophages to a reparative phenotype, which results in enhanced repair and improved hemodynamic performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results reveal, for the first time, that the cytosolic DNA receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase functions during cardiac ischemia as a pattern recognition receptor in the sterile immune response.

Integrating network reconstruction with mechanistic modeling to predict cancer therapies
<p>Signal transduction networks are often rewired in cancer cells. Identifying these alterations will enable more effective cancer treatment. We developed a computational framework that can identify, reconstruct, and mechanistically model these rewired networks from noisy and incomplete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation response data and then predict potential targets for intervention. As a proof of principle, we analyzed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation data set targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) pathways in a panel of colorectal cancer cells. Our computational approach predicted cell line–specific network rewiring. In particular, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> inhibition of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) by the kinase p70S6K was predicted to confer resistance to EGFR inhibition, suggesting that disrupting this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> may restore sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in colorectal cancer cells. We experimentally validated this prediction with colorectal cancer cell lines in culture and in a zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) xenograft model.</p>

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ed p53 dynamics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

Multiepitope tissue analysis reveals SPPL3-mediated ADAM10 activation as a key step in the transformation of melanocytes
<p>The evolution of cancer is characterized by the appearance of specific mutations, but these mutations are translated into proteins that must cooperate to induce malignant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation. Using a systemic approach with the multiepitope ligand cartography (MELC) technology, we analyzed protein expression profiles (PEPs) in nevi and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-positive superficial spreading melanomas (SSMs) from patient tissues to identify key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation events. The PEPs in nevi and SSMs differed predominantly in the abundance of specific antigens, but the PEPs of nevi- and melanoma-associated keratinocytes gradually changed during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation process. A stepwise change in PEP with similar properties occurred in keratinocytes cocultured with melanoma cells. Analysis of the individual steps indicated that activation of the metalloproteinase ADAM10 by signal peptide peptidase–like 3 (SPPL3) triggered by mutant BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> was a critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation event. SPPL3-mediated ADAM10 activation involved the translocation of SPPL3 and ADAM10 into Rab4- or Rab27-positive endosomal compartments. This endosomal translocation, and hence ADAM10 activation, was inhibited by the presence of the tumor suppressor PTEN. Our findings suggest that systematic tissue antigen analysis could complement whole-genome approaches to provide more insight into cancer development.</p>

Chemically reversible isomerization of inorganic clusters
<p>Structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ations in molecules and solids have generally been studied in isolation, whereas intermediate systems have eluded characterization. We show that a pair of cadmium sulfide (CdS) cluster isomers provides an advantageous experimental platform to study isomerization in well-defined, atomically precise systems. The clusters coherently interconvert over an ~1–electron volt energy barrier with a 140–milli–electron volt shift in their excitonic energy gaps. There is a diffusionless, displacive reconfiguration of the inorganic core (solid-solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation) with first order (isomerization-like) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation kinetics. Driven by a distortion of the ligand-binding motifs, the presence of hydroxyl species changes the surface energy via physisorption, which determines “phase” stability in this system. This reaction possesses essential characteristics of both solid-solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ations and molecular isomerizations and bridges these disparate length scales.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked lasers, micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin lasers. The recent advent of hybrid photonic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that this silicon-based Brillouin laser enters a regime of dynamics in which optical self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lation produces phonon linewidth narrowing.

Calibrated mitotic oscillator drives motile ciliogenesis
<p>Cell division and differentiation depend on massive and rapid organelle remodeling. The mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator, centered on the cyclin-dependent kinase 1–anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (CDK1-APC/C) axis, spatiotemporally coordinates this reorganization in dividing cells. Here we discovered that nondividing cells could also implement this mitotic clocklike regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> to orchestrate subcellular reorganization associated with differentiation. We probed centriole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation in differentiating mouse-brain multiciliated cells. These postmitotic progenitors fine-tuned mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator activity to drive the orderly progression of centriole production, maturation, and motile ciliation while avoiding the mitosis commitment threshold. Insufficient CDK1 activity hindered differentiation, whereas excessive activity accelerated differentiation yet drove postmitotic progenitors into mitosis. Thus, postmitotic cells can redeploy and calibrate the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator to uncouple cytoplasmic from nuclear dynamics for organelle remodeling associated with differentiation.</p>

Defibrillation of soft porous metal-organic frameworks with electric fields
<p>Gas transport through metal-organic framework membranes (MOFs) was switched in situ by applying an external electric field (E-field). The switching of gas permeation upon E-field polarization could be explained by the structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation of the zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 into polymorphs with more rigid lattices. Permeation measurements under a direct-current E-field poling of 500 volts per millimeter showed reversibly controlled switching of the ZIF-8 into polar polymorphs, which was confirmed by x-ray diffraction and ab initio calculations. The stiffening of the lattice causes a reduction in gas transport through the membrane and sharpens the molecular sieving capability.

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator period are thought to adjust the timing of biological activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the dynamic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the dynamic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of biological events. Our data provide insight into how the dynamic period adjustment of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and metabolism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the rotation of the planet. Photosynthesis is a key metabolic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of photosynthesis, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from photosynthesis also feeds back to regulate the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by stabilizing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the stability of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis in plants enables the development of high-throughput mutagenesis strategies. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were generated with minimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 targeted genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying targeted genes. Plants with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a collection of lines with targeted mutations and should be applicable to any plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation system.</p>

Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ed colonies of <i>Phenganax parrini</i> and <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibit migration of symbionts of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. into the stolons. Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light (due to the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation on photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark (due to the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation on respiration alone). Colonies of <i>P. parrini</i>, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark, while colonies of <i>P. parrini</i> maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P)H in the stolons were unaffected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.</p>

Octopaminergic modulation of the visual flight speed regulator of <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that flies' sensitivity to large-field optic flow is increased by the release of octopamine during flight.

To determine where in the neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> this comparison is made, we selectively silenced the octopamine neurons in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i>, and examined the effect on vision-based velocity regulation in free-flying flies.

Artifactual mutations resulting from DNA lesions limit detection levels in ultrasensitive sequencing applications
<p>The need in cancer research or evolutionary biology to detect rare mutations or variants present at very low frequencies (<10<sup>−5</sup>) poses an increasing demand on lowering the detection limits of available methods. Here we demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>able DNA lesions introduce important error sources in ultrasensitive technologies such as single molecule PCR (smPCR) applications (e.g. droplet-digital PCR), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) based methods. Using templates with known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>able lesions (8-oxoguanine, deaminated 5-methylcytosine, uracil, and DNA heteroduplexes), we assessed with smPCR and duplex sequencing that templates with these lesions were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed very efficiently by proofreading polymerases (except uracil), leading to G->T, and to a lesser extent, to unreported G->C substitutions at 8-oxoguanine lesions, and C->T transitions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed uracil containing templates. Long heat incubations common in many DNA extraction protocols significantly increased the number of G->T substitutions. Moreover, in ∼50-80% smPCR reactions we observed the random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation preference of only one of both DNA strands explaining the known ‘PCR jackpot effect’, with the result that a lesion became indistinguishable from a true mutation or variant. Finally, we showed that artifactual mutations derived from uracil and 8-oxoguanine could be significantly reduced by DNA repair enzymes.</p>

The NACIAM trial (N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction) examined the effects of NAC on infarct size in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluated the effects of intravenous high-dose NAC (29 g over 2 days) with background low-dose nitroglycerin (7.2 mg over 2 days) on early cardiac magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance imaging–assessed infarct size. Secondary end points included cardiac magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance–determined myocardial salvage and creatine kinase kinetics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 112 randomized patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction, 75 (37 in NAC group, 38 in placebo group) underwent early cardiac magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance imaging. Median duration of ischemia pretreatment was 2.4 hours. With background nitroglycerin infusion administered to all patients, those randomized to NAC exhibited an absolute 5.5% reduction in cardiac magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance–assessed infarct size relative to placebo (median, 11.0%; [interquartile range 4.1, 16.3] versus 16.5%; [interquartile range 10.7, 24.2]; <i>P</i>=0.02). Myocardial salvage was approximately doubled in the NAC group (60%; interquartile range, 37–79) compared with placebo (27%; interquartile range, 14–42; <i>P</i><0.01) and median creatine kinase areas under the curve were 22 000 and 38 000 IU·h in the NAC and placebo groups, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>High-dose intravenous NAC administered with low-dose intravenous nitroglycerin is associated with reduced infarct size in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

High-Sensitive Cardiac Troponin T as an Early Biochemical Signature for Clinical and Subclinical Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although small elevations of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) are associated with incident heart failure (HF) in the general population, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. Evaluating the association of hs-cTnT with replacement fibrosis and progression of structural heart disease before symptoms is fundamental to understanding the potential of this biomarker in a HF prevention strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We measured hs-cTnT at baseline among 4986 participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a cohort initially free of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiac magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance imaging was performed at baseline. Repeat cardiac magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance was performed 10 years later among 2831 participants who remained free of interim CVD events; of these, 1723 received gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance for characterization of replacement fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement. Progression of subclinical CVD was defined by 10-year change in left ventricular structure and function. Associations of hs-cTnT with incident HF, CV-related mortality, and coronary heart disease were estimated using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Late gadolinium enhancement for replacement fibrosis was detectable in 6.3% participants without interim CVD events by follow-up cardiac magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance. A graded association was observed between higher baseline hs-cTnT categories and late gadolinium enhancement (≥7.42 ng/L versus <limit of detection [<3 ng/L]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–5.94). Higher hs-cTnT was also associated with a greater probability of an increase in LV mass >12% (highest category versus <limit of detection; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–2.07), but not with decline in left ventricular ejection fraction. The risk of incident HF was greater for higher hs-cTnT (≥8.81 ng/L versus <limit of detection; adjusted hazards ratio, 5.59; 95% CI, 2.97–10.68).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>hs-cTnT levels are associated with replacement fibrosis and progressive changes in left ventricular structure in CVD-free adults, findings that may precede HF symptoms by years. Minor elevations of hs-cTnT may represent a biochemical signature of early subclinical cardiac disease, providing an opportunity for targeted preventive interventions.</p></sec>

Evaluation of Cell Therapy on Exercise Performance and Limb Perfusion in Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease affects 8% to 12% of Americans >65 years of age and is associated with a major decline in functional status, increased myocardial infarction and stroke rates, and increased risk of ischemic amputation. Current treatment strategies for claudication have limitations. PACE (Patients With Intermittent Claudication Injected With ALDH Bright Cells) is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–sponsored, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 exploratory clinical trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow–derived aldehyde dehydrogenase bright (ALDHbr) cells in patients with peripheral artery disease and to explore associated claudication physiological mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All participants, randomized 1:1 to receive ALDHbr cells or placebo, underwent bone marrow aspiration and isolation of ALDHbr cells, followed by 10 injections into the thigh and calf of the index leg. The coprimary end points were change from baseline to 6 months in peak walking time (PWT), collateral count, peak hyperemic popliteal flow, and capillary perfusion measured by magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance imaging, as well as safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 82 patients with claudication and infrainguinal peripheral artery disease were randomized at 9 sites, of whom 78 had analyzable data (57 male, 21 female patients; mean age, 66±9 years). The mean±SEM differences in the change over 6 months between study groups for PWT (0.9±0.8 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.6 to 2.5; <i>P</i>=0.238), collateral count (0.9±0.6 arteries; 95% CI, −0.2 to 2.1; P=0.116), peak hyperemic popliteal flow (0.0±0.4 mL/s; 95% CI, −0.8 to 0.8; <i>P</i>=0.978), and capillary perfusion (−0.2±0.6%; 95% CI, −1.3 to 0.9; P=0.752) were not significant. In addition, there were no significant differences for the secondary end points, including quality-of-life measures. There were no adverse safety outcomes. Correlative relationships between magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance imaging measures and PWT were not significant. A post hoc exploratory analysis suggested that ALDHbr cell administration might be associated with an increase in the number of collateral arteries (1.5±0.7; 95% CI, 0.1–2.9; <i>P</i>=0.047) in participants with completely occluded femoral arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>ALDHbr cell administration did not improve PWT or magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance outcomes, and the changes in PWT were not associated with the anatomic or physiological magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance imaging end points.

Enhanced photovoltage for inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells
<p>The highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reported for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invert</span></strong>ed planar structures are still inferior to those of PSCs with regular structures, mainly because of lower open-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> voltages (<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub>). Here we report a strategy to reduce nonradiative recombination for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invert</span></strong>ed devices, based on a simple solution-processed secondary growth technique. This approach produces a wider bandgap top layer and a more n-type perovskite film, which mitigates nonradiative recombination, leading to an increase in <i>V</i><sub>oc</sub> by up to 100 millivolts. We achieved a high <i>V</i><sub>oc</sub> of 1.21 volts without sacrificing photocurrent, corresponding to a voltage deficit of 0.41 volts at a bandgap of 1.62 electron volts. This improvement led to a stabilized power output approaching 21% at the maximum power point.</p>

Purcell effect for active tuning of light scattering from semiconductor optical antennas
<p>Subwavelength, high–refractive index semiconductor nanostructures support optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances that endow them with valuable antenna functions. Control over the intrinsic properties, including their complex refractive index, size, and geometry, has been used to manipulate fundamental light absorption, scattering, and emission processes in nanostructured optoelectronic devices. In this study, we harness the electric and magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances of such antennas to achieve a very strong dependence of the optical properties on the external environment. Specifically, we illustrate how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant scattering wavelength of single silicon nanowires is tunable across the entire visible spectrum by simply moving the height of the nanowires above a metallic mirror. We apply this concept by using a nanoelectromechanical platform to demonstrate active tuning.</p>

Observations and modeling of the elastogravity signals preceding direct seismic waves
<p>After an earthquake, the earliest deformation signals are not expected to be carried by the fastest (<i>P</i>) elastic waves but by the speed-of-light changes of the gravitational field. However, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ations are weak and, so far, their detection has not been accurate enough to fully understand their origins and to use them for a highly valuable rapid estimate of the earthquake magnitude. We show that gravity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ations are particularly well observed with broadband seismometers at distances between 1000 and 2000 kilometers from the source of the 2011, moment magnitude 9.1, Tohoku earthquake. We can accurately model them by a new formalism, taking into account both the gravity changes and the gravity-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>. These prompt elastogravity signals open the window for minute time-scale magnitude determination for great earthquakes.</p>

Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometry of single phonons from an optomechanical resonator
<p>Nano- and micromechanical solid-state quantum devices have become a focus of attention. Reliably generating nonclassical states of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> is of interest both for addressing fundamental questions about macroscopic quantum phenomena and for developing quantum technologies in the domains of sensing and transduction. We used quantum optical control techniques to conditionally generate single-phonon Fock states of a nanomechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ator. We performed a Hanbury Brown and Twiss–type experiment that verified the nonclassical nature of the phonon state without requiring full state reconstruction. Our result establishes purely optical quantum control of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator at the single-phonon level.</p>

Spatiotemporal mode-locking in multimode fiber lasers
<p>A laser is based on the electromagnetic modes of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ator, which provides the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feedback</span></strong> required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lation. Enormous progress has been made toward controlling the interactions of longitudinal modes in lasers with a single transverse mode. For example, the field of ultrafast science has been built on lasers that lock many longitudinal modes together to form ultrashort light pulses. However, coherent superposition of longitudinal and transverse modes in a laser has received little attention. We show that modal and chromatic dispersions in fiber lasers can be counteracted by strong spatial and spectral filtering. This allows locking of multiple transverse and longitudinal modes to create ultrashort pulses with a variety of spatiotemporal profiles. Multimode fiber lasers thus open new directions in studies of nonlinear wave propagation and capabilities for applications.</p>

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience. As explosions pattern the sky, the visual system must capture information about the time-varying positions, colors, and contrasts of myriad spots of light. This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s that map visual space. To generate this retinotopy (visual mapping), neurons must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved? The molecules that regulate neuronal differentiation have been described in detail, as have the cues that allow differentiated neurons to reach and choose their synaptic partners (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, the mechanisms that coordinate neuronal specification with the development of retinotopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> wiring have remained elusive. On page 886 of this issue, Fernandes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that in the visual system of flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), photoreceptors use glial cells as intermediaries to communicate with their neural targets to generate retinotopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.</p>

Reconfiguration of DNA molecular arrays driven by information relay
<p>Information relay at the molecular level is an essential phenomenon in numerous chemical and biological processes, such as intricate signaling cascades. One key challenge in synthetic molecular self-assembly is to construct artificial structures that imitate these complex behaviors in controllable systems. We demonstrated prescribed, long-range information relay in an artificial molecular array assembled from modular DNA structural units. The dynamic DNA molecular array exhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ations with programmable initiation, propagation, and regulation. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation of the array can be initiated at selected units and then propagated, without addition of extra triggers, to neighboring units and eventually the entire array. The specific information pathways by which this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation occurs can be controlled by altering the design of individual units and the arrays.</p>

History of winning remodels thalamo-PFC circuit to reinforce social dominance
<p>Mental strength and history of winning play an important role in the determination of social dominance. However, the neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s mediating these intrinsic and extrinsic factors have remained unclear. Working in mice, we identified a dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) neural population showing “effort”-related firing during moment-to-moment competition in the dominance tube test. Activation or inhibition of the dmPFC induces instant winning or losing, respectively. In vivo optogenetic-based long-term potentiation and depression experiments establish that the mediodorsal thalamic input to the dmPFC mediates long-lasting changes in the social dominance status that are affected by history of winning. The same neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> also underlies transfer of dominance between different social contests. These results provide a framework for understanding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> basis of adaptive and pathological social behaviors.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant and wave-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

Branch-specific plasticity of a bifunctional dopamine circuit encodes protein hunger
<p>Free-living animals must not only regulate the amount of food they consume but also choose which types of food to ingest. The shifting of food preference driven by nutrient-specific hunger can be essential for survival, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We identified a dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that encodes protein-specific hunger in <i>Drosophila</i>. The activity of these neurons increased after substantial protein deprivation. Activation of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> simultaneously promoted protein intake and restricted sugar consumption, via signaling to distinct downstream neurons. Protein starvation triggered branch-specific plastic changes in these dopaminergic neurons, thus enabling sustained protein consumption. These studies reveal a crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> mechanism by which animals adjust their dietary strategy to maintain protein homeostasis.</p>

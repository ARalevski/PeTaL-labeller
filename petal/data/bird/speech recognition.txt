Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one sex or species with the leg coloration of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion template for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

A generative vision model that trains with high data efficiency and breaks text-based CAPTCHAs
<p>Learning from a few examples and generalizing to markedly different situations are capabilities of human visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intellig</span></strong>ence that are yet to be matched by leading machine learning models. By drawing inspiration from systems neuroscience, we introduce a probabilistic generative model for vision in which message-passing–based inference handles <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion, segmentation, and reasoning in a unified way. The model demonstrates excellent generalization and occlusion-reasoning capabilities and outperforms deep neural networks on a challenging scene text <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion benchmark while being 300-fold more data efficient. In addition, the model fundamentally breaks the defense of modern text-based CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) by generatively segmenting characters without CAPTCHA-specific heuristics. Our model emphasizes aspects such as data efficiency and compositionality that may be important in the path toward general artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intellig</span></strong>ence.</p>

Two areas for familiar face recognition in the primate brain
<p>Familiarity alters face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion: Familiar faces are recognized more accurately than unfamiliar ones and under difficult viewing conditions when unfamiliar face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion fails. The neural basis for this fundamental difference remains unknown. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that personally familiar faces engage the macaque face-processing network more than unfamiliar faces. Familiar faces also recruited two hitherto unknown face areas at anatomically conserved locations within the perirhinal cortex and the temporal pole. These two areas, but not the core face-processing network, responded to familiar faces emerging from a blur with a characteristic nonlinear surge, akin to the abruptness of familiar face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion. In contrast, responses to unfamiliar faces and objects remained linear. Thus, two temporal lobe areas extend the core face-processing network into a familiar face-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion system.</p>

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intellig</span></strong>ence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known systems carrying out complex computations were biological nervous systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to brain circuits as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intellig</span></strong>ent computation by brain-like circuits (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical circuitry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep network” (or deep net) architecture, this brain-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI systems has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central areas of AI research, including computer vision, speech <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as computer vision and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of brain circuitry could supply cues for guiding network models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

Intonational speech prosody encoding in the human auditory cortex
<p>Speakers of all human languages regularly use intonational pitch to convey <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linguist</span></strong>ic meaning, such as to emphasize a particular word. Listeners extract pitch movements from speech and evaluate the shape of intonation contours independent of each speaker’s pitch range. We used high-density electrocorticography to record neural population activity directly from the brain surface while participants listened to sentences that varied in intonational pitch contour, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonet</span></strong>ic content, and speaker. Cortical activity at single electrodes over the human superior temporal gyrus selectively represented intonation contours. These electrodes were intermixed with, yet functionally distinct from, sites that encoded different information about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonet</span></strong>ic features or speaker identity. Furthermore, the representation of intonation contours directly reflected the encoding of speaker-normalized relative pitch but not absolute pitch.</p>

Causal neural network of metamemory for retrospection in primates
<p>We know how confidently we know: Metacognitive self-monitoring of memory states, so-called “metamemory,” enables strategic and efficient information collection based on past experiences. However, it is unknown how metamemory is implemented in the brain. We explored causal neural mechanism of metamemory in macaque monkeys performing metacognitive confidence judgments on memory. By whole-brain searches via functional magnetic resonance imaging, we discovered a neural correlate of metamemory for temporally remote events in prefrontal area 9 (or 9/46d), along with that for recent events within area 6. Reversible inactivation of each of these identified loci induced doubly dissociated selective impairments in metacognitive judgment performance on remote or recent memory, without impairing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion performance itself. The findings reveal that parallel metamemory streams supervise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion networks for remote and recent memory, without contributing to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion itself.</p>

Source of CpG Depletion in the HIV-1 Genome
<p>The dinucleotide CpG is highly underrepresented in the genome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). To identify the source of CpG depletion in the HIV-1 genome, we investigated two biological mechanisms: (1) CpG methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and (2) CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We hypothesized that HIV-1 has been under selective evolutionary pressure by these mechanisms leading to the reduction of CpG in its genome. A CpG depleted genome would enable HIV-1 to avoid methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and/or to avoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion by TLRs that identify foreign CpG sequences. We investigated these two hypotheses by determining the sequence context dependency of CpG depletion and comparing it with that of CpG methylation and TLR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion. We found that in both human and HIV-1 genomes the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were depleted most and those flanked by C/G were depleted least. Similarly, our analyses of human methylome data revealed that the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were methylated most and those flanked by C/G were methylated least. Given that a similar CpG depletion pattern was observed for the human genome within which CpGs are not likely to be recognized by TLRs, we argue that the main source of CpG depletion in HIV-1 is likely host-induced methylation. Analyses of CpG motifs in over 100 viruses revealed that this unique CpG representation pattern is specific to the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses.</p>

Distinct control of PERIOD2 degradation and circadian rhythms by the oncoprotein and ubiquitin ligase MDM2
<p>The circadian clock relies on posttranslational modifications to set the timing for degradation of core regulatory components, which drives clock progression. Ubiquitin-modifying enzymes that target clock components for degradation mainly recognize phosphorylated substrates. Degradation of the circadian clock component PERIOD 2 (PER2) is mediated by its phospho-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion by β-transducin repeat–containing proteins (β-TrCPs), which are F-box–containing proteins that function as substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion subunits of the SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex. However, this mode of regulating PER2 stability falls short of explaining the persistent oscillatory phenotypes reported in biological systems lacking functional elements of the phospho-dependent PER2 degradation machinery. We identified PER2 as a previously uncharacterized substrate for the ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and found that MDM2 targeted PER2 for degradation in a manner independent of PER2 phosphorylation. Deregulation of MDM2 plays a major role in oncogenesis by contributing to the accumulation of genomic and epigenomic alterations that favor tumor development. MDM2-mediated PER2 turnover was important for defining the circadian period length in mammalian cells, a finding that emphasizes the connection between the circadian clock and cancer. Our results not only broaden the range of specific substrates of MDM2 beyond the cell cycle to include circadian components but also identify a previously unknown regulator of the clock as a druggable node that is often found to be deregulated during tumorigenesis.</p>

Ligand-triggered allosteric ADP release primes a plant NLR complex
<p>Pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion by nucleotide-binding (NB), leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors (NLRs) plays roles in plant immunity. The <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> pv.<i> campestris</i> effector AvrAC uridylylates the <i>Arabidopsis</i> PBL2 kinase, and the latter (PBL2<sup>UMP</sup>) acts as a ligand to activate the NLR ZAR1 precomplexed with the RKS1 pseudokinase. Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy structures of ZAR1-RKS1 and ZAR1-RKS1-PBL2<sup>UMP</sup> in an inactive and intermediate state, respectively. The ZAR1<sup>LRR</sup> domain, compared with animal NLR<sup>LRR</sup> domains, is differently positioned to sequester ZAR1 in an inactive state. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of PBL2<sup>UMP</sup> is exclusively through RKS1, which interacts with ZAR1<sup>LRR</sup>. PBL2<sup>UMP</sup> binding stabilizes the RKS1 activation segment, which sterically blocks ZAR1 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) binding. This engenders a more flexible NB domain without conformational changes in the other ZAR1 domains. Our study provides a structural template for understanding plant NLRs.</p>

Human sound systems are shaped by post-Neolithic changes in bite configuration
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linguist</span></strong>ic diversity, now and in the past, is widely regarded to be independent of biological changes that took place after the emergence of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. We show converging evidence from paleoanthropology, speech biomechanics, ethnography, and historical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linguist</span></strong>ics that labiodental sounds (such as “f” and “v”) were innovated after the Neolithic. Changes in diet attributable to food-processing technologies modified the human bite from an edge-to-edge configuration to one that preserves adolescent overbite and overjet into adulthood. This change favored the emergence and maintenance of labiodentals. Our findings suggest that language is shaped not only by the contingencies of its history, but also by culturally induced changes in human biology.</p>

Correlations in high-harmonic generation of matter-wave jets revealed by pattern recognition
<p>Correlations in interacting many-body systems are key to the study of quantum matter. The complexity of the correlations typically grows quickly as the system evolves and thus presents a challenge for experimental characterization and intuitive understanding. In a strongly driven Bose-Einstein condensate, we observe the high-harmonic generation of matter-wave jets with complex correlations as a result of bosonic stimulation. Based on a pattern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion scheme, we identify a pattern of correlations that reveals the underlying secondary scattering processes and higher-order correlations.

Engineered CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease with expanded targeting space

However, the widely used <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> Cas9 enzyme (SpCas9) requires an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion, thereby restricting the targetable genomic loci. Here, we report a rationally engineered SpCas9 variant (SpCas9-NG) that can recognize relaxed NG PAMs. The crystal structure revealed that the loss of the base-specific interaction with the third nucleobase is compensated by newly introduced non–base-specific interactions, thereby enabling the NG PAM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion. We showed that SpCas9-NG induces indels at endogenous target sites bearing NG PAMs in human cells. Furthermore, we found that the fusion of SpCas9-NG and the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mediates the C-to-T conversion at target sites with NG PAMs in human cells.</p>

A molecular mechanism for Wnt ligand-specific signaling
<p>Wnt signaling is key to many developmental, physiological, and disease processes in which cells seem able to discriminate between multiple Wnt ligands. This selective Wnt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion or “decoding” capacity has remained enigmatic because Wnt/Frizzled interactions are largely incompatible with monospecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion. Gpr124 and Reck enable brain endothelial cells to selectively respond to Wnt7. We show that Reck binds with low micromolar affinity to the intrinsically disordered linker region of Wnt7. Availability of Reck-bound Wnt7 for Frizzled signaling relies on the interaction between Gpr124 and Dishevelled. Through polymerization, Dishevelled recruits Gpr124 and the associated Reck-bound Wnt7 into dynamic Wnt/Frizzled/Lrp5/6 signalosomes, resulting in increased local concentrations of Wnt7 available for Frizzled signaling. This work provides mechanistic insights into the Wnt decoding capacities of vertebrate cells and unravels structural determinants of the functional diversification of Wnt family members.</p>

Structural mechanisms of centromeric nucleosome recognition by the kinetochore protein CENP-N
<p>Accurate chromosome segregation requires the proper assembly of kinetochore proteins. A key step in this process is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of the histone H3 variant CENP-A in the centromeric nucleosome by the kinetochore protein CENP-N. We report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological studies of the interaction between the CENP-A nucleosome and CENP-N. We show that human CENP-N confers binding specificity through interactions with the L1 loop of CENP-A, stabilized by electrostatic interactions with the nucleosomal DNA. Mutational analyses demonstrate analogous interactions in <i>Xenopus</i>, which are further supported by residue-swapping experiments involving the L1 loop of CENP-A. Our results are consistent with the coevolution of CENP-N and CENP-A and establish the structural basis for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of the CENP-A nucleosome to enable kinetochore assembly and centromeric chromatin organization.</p>

Furthermore, one or more unidentified proteins become stably associated with the P complex, securing the 3′ exon and potentially regulating activity of the helicase Prp22. Prp22 binds nucleotides 15 to 21 in the 3′ exon, enabling it to pull the intron-exon or ligated exons in a 3′ to 5′ direction to achieve 3′-ss proofreading or exon release, respectively.</p>

Structures of the CRISPR genome integration complex

The structures show unexpectedly that indirect sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion dictates integration site selection by favoring deformation of the repeat and the flanking sequences. IHF binding bends the DNA sharply, bringing an upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion motif into contact with Cas1 to increase both the specificity and efficiency of integration.

Macrophage function in tissue repair and remodeling requires IL-4 or IL-13 with apoptotic cells
<p>Tissue repair is a subset of a broad repertoire of interleukin-4 (IL-4)– and IL-13–dependent host responses during helminth infection.

Genetic ablation of sensors of apoptotic cells impaired the proliferation of tissue-resident macrophages and the induction of anti-inflammatory and tissue repair genes in the lungs after helminth infection or in the gut after induction of colitis. By contrast, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of apoptotic cells was dispensable for cytokine-dependent induction of pattern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion receptor, cell adhesion, or chemotaxis genes in macrophages.

Microstructural proliferation in human cortex is coupled with the development of face processing

Development of face-selective regions, but not place-selective regions, is dominated by microstructural proliferation. This tissue development is correlated with specific increases in functional selectivity to faces, as well as improvements in face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion, and ultimately leads to differentiated tissue properties between face- and place-selective regions in adulthood, which we validate with postmortem cytoarchitectonic measurements.

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host gene-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene interactions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Phosphorylation of Arabidopsis MAP Kinase Phosphatase 1 (MKP1) Is Required for PAMP Responses and Resistance against Bacteria
<p>Plants perceive potential pathogens via the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized pattern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion receptors, which initiates a series of intracellular responses that ultimately limit bacterial growth. PAMP responses include changes in intracellular protein phosphorylation, including the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), such as Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MKP1, are important negative regulators of MAPKs and play a crucial role in controlling the intensity and duration of MAPK activation during innate immune signaling. As such, the <i>mkp1</i> mutant lacking MKP1 displays enhanced PAMP responses and resistance against the virulent bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. Previous in vitro studies showed that MKP1 can be phosphorylated and activated by MPK6, suggesting that phosphorylation may be an important mechanism for regulating MKP1. We found that MKP1 was phosphorylated during PAMP elicitation and that phosphorylation stabilized the protein, resulting in protein accumulation after elicitation. MKP1 also can be stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that MKP1 is constitutively degraded through the proteasome in the resting state. In addition, we investigated the role of MKP1 posttranslational regulation in plant defense by testing whether phenotypes of the <i>mkp1</i> Arabidopsis mutant could be complemented by expressing phosphorylation site mutations of MKP1. The phosphorylation of MKP1 was found to be required for some, but not all, of MKP1’s functions in PAMP responses and defense against bacteria. Together, our results provide insight into the roles of phosphorylation in the regulation of MKP1 during PAMP signaling and resistance to bacteria.</p>

Sequence Exchange between Homologous NB-LRR Genes Converts Virus Resistance into Nematode Resistance, and Vice Versa
<p>Plants have evolved a limited repertoire of NB-LRR disease resistance (<i>R</i>) genes to protect themselves against myriad pathogens. This limitation is thought to be counterbalanced by the rapid evolution of NB-LRR proteins, as only a few sequence changes have been shown to be sufficient to alter resistance specificities toward novel strains of a pathogen. However, little is known about the flexibility of NB-LRR <i>R</i> genes to switch resistance specificities between phylogenetically unrelated pathogens. To investigate this, we created domain swaps between the close homologs <i>Gpa2</i> and <i>Rx1</i>, which confer resistance in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) to the cyst nematode <i>Globodera pallida</i> and <i>Potato virus X</i>, respectively. The genetic fusion of the CC-NB-ARC of Gpa2 with the LRR of Rx1 (Gpa2<sub>CN</sub>/Rx1<sub>L</sub>) results in autoactivity, but lowering the protein levels restored its specific activation response, including extreme resistance to <i>Potato virus X</i> in potato shoots. The reciprocal chimera (Rx1<sub>CN</sub>/Gpa2<sub>L</sub>) shows a loss-of-function phenotype, but exchange of the first three LRRs of Gpa2 by the corresponding region of Rx1 was sufficient to regain a wild-type resistance response to <i>G. pallida</i> in the roots. These data demonstrate that exchanging the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion moiety in the LRR is sufficient to convert extreme virus resistance in the leaves into mild nematode resistance in the roots, and vice versa. In addition, we show that the CC-NB-ARC can operate independently of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion specificities defined by the LRR domain, either aboveground or belowground. These data show the versatility of NB-LRR genes to generate resistance to unrelated pathogens with completely different lifestyles and routes of invasion.</p>

Adaptive evolution of fish hatching enzyme: one amino acid substitution results in differential salt dependency of the enzyme
<p>Embryos of medaka <i>Oryzias latipes</i> hatch in freshwater, while those of killifish <i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i> hatch in brackish water. Medaka and <i>Fundulus</i> possess two kinds of hatching enzymes, high choriolytic enzyme (HCE) and low choriolytic enzyme (LCE), which cooperatively digest their egg envelope at the time of hatching. Optimal salinity of medaka HCE was found in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and activity decreased with increasing salt concentrations. One of the two <i>Fundulus</i> HCEs, FHCE1, showed the highest activity in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and the other, FHCE2, showed the highest activity in 0.125 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl. The results suggest that the salt dependencies of HCEs are well adapted to each salinity at the time of hatching. Different from HCE, LCEs of both species maintained the activity sufficient for egg envelope digestion in various salinities. The difference in amino acid sequence between FHCE1 and FHCE2 was found at only a single site at position 36 (Gly/Arg), suggesting that this single substitution causes the different salt dependency between the two enzymes. Superimposition of FHCE1 and FHCE2 with the 3-D structure model of medaka HCE revealed that position 36 was located on the surface of HCE molecule, far from its active site cleft. The results suggest a hypothesis that position 36 influences salt-dependent activity of HCE, not with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of primary structure around the cleavage site, but with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of higher ordered structure of egg envelope protein.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of plants are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis modeling. However, the construction of accurate 3D plant models is challenging, as plants are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-based method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intellig</span></strong>ently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all plants, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target plant, tuning camera placement to match the plant’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic plant modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based plant reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different plant structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of plant types.</p>

The Photosystem II Repair Cycle Requires FtsH Turnover through the EngA GTPase
<p>Specific degradation of photodamaged D1, the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center protein, is a crucial step in the PSII repair cycle to maintain photosynthesis activity. Processive proteolysis by the FtsH protease is fundamental to cooperative D1 degradation. Here, we attempted to purify the FtsH complex to elucidate its regulation mechanisms and substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Unlike previously reported prokaryotic and mitochondrial FtsHs, the Arabidopsis chloroplastic FtsH does not appear to form a megacomplex with prohibition-like proteins but instead accumulates as smaller complexes. The copurified fraction was enriched with a partial PSII intermediate presumably undergoing repair, although its precise properties were not fully clarified. In addition, we copurified a bacteria-type GTPase localized in chloroplasts, EngA, and confirmed its interaction with FtsH by subsequent pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. While the <i>engA</i> mutation is embryo lethal, the transgenic lines overexpressing EngA (EngA-OX) showed leaf variegation reminiscent of the variegated mutant lacking FtsH2. EngA-OX was revealed to accumulate more cleaved D1 fragments and reactive oxygen species than the wild type, indicative of compromised PSII repair. Based on these results and the fact that FtsH becomes more stable in EngA-OX, we propose that EngA negatively regulates FtsH stability. We demonstrate that proper FtsH turnover is crucial for PSII repair in the chloroplasts of Arabidopsis. Consistent with the increased turnover of FtsH under high-light conditions in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, our findings underline the rapid turnover of not only D1 but also FtsH proteases in the PSII repair cycle.</p>

Roles of Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase VII Members in Pattern-Triggered Immune Signaling
<p>Pattern-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion receptors (PRRs), which consist of receptor kinases (RKs) and receptor-like proteins, sense microbe- and host-derived molecular patterns associated with pathogen infection to trigger immune responses in plants. Several kinases of the 46-member Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamily VII play important roles in pattern-triggered immunity, but it is unclear whether different RLCK VII members act specifically or redundantly in immune signaling. Here, we constructed nine higher order mutants of this subfamily (named <i>rlck vii-1</i> to <i>rlck vii-9</i>) and systematically characterized their immune phenotypes. The mutants <i>rlck vii-5</i>, -<i>7</i>, and -<i>8</i> had compromised reactive oxygen species production in response to all patterns tested, indicating that the corresponding members are broadly required for the signaling of multiple PRRs. However, <i>rlck vii-4</i> was defective specifically in chitin-induced reactive oxygen species production, suggesting that RCLK VII-4 members mediate the signaling of specific PRRs. Furthermore, RLCK VII-4 members were required for the chitin-triggered activation of MAPK, demonstrating that these kinases link a PRR to MAPK activation. Moreover, we found that RLCK VII-6 and -8 also were required for RK-mediated root growth. Together, these results show that numerous RLCK VII members are involved in pattern-triggered immune signaling and uncover both common and specific roles of these kinases in plant development and immunity mediated by various RKs.</p>

<i>NLR</i> Mutations Suppressing Immune Hybrid Incompatibility and Their Effects on Disease Resistance
<p>Genetic divergence between populations can lead to reproductive isolation. Hybrid incompatibilities (HI) represent intermediate points along a continuum toward speciation. In plants, genetic variation in disease resistance (<i>R</i>) genes underlies several cases of HI. The progeny of a cross between Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>, Poland) and Kashmir2 (Kas2, central Asia) exhibits immune-related HI. This incompatibility is due to a genetic interaction between a cluster of eight <i>TNL (TOLL/INTERLEUKIN1 RECEPTOR-NUCLEOTIDE BINDING-LEU RICH REPEAT</i>) <i>RPP1</i> (<i>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA1)</i>-<i>like</i> genes (<i>R1</i>–<i>R8</i>) from L<i>er</i> and central Asian alleles of a <i>Strubbelig</i>-family receptor-like kinase (<i>SRF3</i>) from Kas2. In characterizing mutants altered in L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI, we mapped multiple mutations to the <i>RPP1</i>-like L<i>er</i> locus. Analysis of these <i>suppressor of Ler/Kas2 incompatibility</i> (<i>sulki</i>) mutants reveals complex, additive and epistatic interactions underlying <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus activity. The effects of these mutations were measured on basal defense, global gene expression, primary metabolism, and disease resistance to a local <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i> isolate (<i>Hpa</i> Gw) collected from Gorzéáéáów (Gw), where the Landsberg accession originated. Gene expression sectors and metabolic hallmarks identified for HI are both dependent and independent of <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> members. We establish that mutations suppressing immune-related L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI do not compromise resistance to <i>Hpa</i> Gw. QTL mapping analysis of <i>Hpa</i> Gw resistance point to <i>RPP7</i> as the causal locus. This work provides insight into the complex genetic architecture of the <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus and immune-related HI in Arabidopsis and into the contributions of <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> genes to HI and defense.</p>

Selective Targeting of Mobile mRNAs to Plasmodesmata for Cell-to-Cell Movement
<p>Many plant mRNAs move from cell to cell or long distance to execute non-cell-autonomous functions. These mobile mRNAs traffic through the phloem to regulate many developmental processes, but despite the burgeoning discovery of mobile mRNAs, little is known about the mechanism underlying the intracellular sorting of these mRNAs. Here, we exploited a fluorescence-based mRNA labeling system, using the bacteriophage coat protein MS2, fused to GFP (MS2-GFP) and an MS2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion site in the RNA of interest, to visualize the intracellular trafficking of mobile mRNAs in living plant cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We first improved this system by using the nuclear localization sequence from FD, which substantially reduced the fluorescent background of MS2-GFP in the cytoplasm. The modified system allowed us to observe the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci dependent on MS2-binding sites. Coexpressing the MS2-GFP system with a virus movement protein, which is a plasmodesmata (PD)-localized nonspecific RNA-binding protein, targeted cytoplasmic fluorescent foci to the PD, suggesting that the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci contain mRNA and MS2-GFP. Our ex vivo RNA imaging revealed that mobile but not nonmobile mRNAs were selectively targeted to PD. Real-time images of intracellular translocation revealed that the translocation of mRNA and organelles in the transvacuolar strands may be governed by the same mechanism. Our study suggests that PD targeting of mRNA is a selective step in determining mRNA cell-to-cell movement of mRNAs.</p>

ALY RNA-Binding Proteins Are Required for Nucleocytosolic mRNA Transport and Modulate Plant Growth and Development
<p>The regulated transport of mRNAs from the cell nucleus to the cytosol is a critical step linking transcript synthesis and processing with translation. However, in plants, only a few of the factors that act in the mRNA export pathway have been functionally characterized. Flowering plant genomes encode several members of the ALY protein family, which function as mRNA export factors in other organisms. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ALY1 to ALY4 are commonly detected in root and leaf cells, but they are differentially expressed in reproductive tissue. Moreover, the subnuclear distribution of ALY1/2 differs from that of ALY3/4. ALY1 binds with higher affinity to single-stranded RNA than double-stranded RNA and single-stranded DNA and interacts preferentially with 5-methylcytosine-modified single-stranded RNA. Compared with the full-length protein, the individual RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion motif of ALY1 binds RNA only weakly. ALY proteins interact with the RNA helicase UAP56, indicating a link to the mRNA export machinery. Consistently, ALY1 complements the lethal phenotype of yeast cells lacking the ALY1 ortholog Yra1. Whereas individual <i>aly</i> mutants have a wild-type appearance, disruption of <i>ALY1</i> to <i>ALY4</i> in <i>4xaly</i> plants causes vegetative and reproductive defects, including strongly reduced growth, altered flower morphology, as well as abnormal ovules and female gametophytes, causing reduced seed production. Moreover, polyadenylated mRNAs accumulate in the nuclei of <i>4xaly</i> cells. Our results highlight the requirement of efficient mRNA nucleocytosolic transport for proper plant growth and development and indicate that ALY1 to ALY4 act partly redundantly in this process; however, differences in expression and subnuclear localization suggest distinct functions.</p>

Heat Shock Factor HsfA1a Is Essential for <i>R</i> Gene-Mediated Nematode Resistance and Triggers H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Production<sup>1</sup>
<p>Plants generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the apoplast in response to pathogen attack, especially following resistance (<i>R</i>) gene-mediated pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion; however, the mechanisms activating ROS generation remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that RKN (<i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>) infection rapidly induces ROS accumulation in the roots of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants that contain the <i>R</i> gene <i>Mi-1.2</i> but rarely induces ROS accumulation in the susceptible or <i>Mi-1.2</i>-silenced resistant genotypes. RNK also induces the hypersensitive response, a form of programmed cell death, in <i>Mi-1.2</i> plants. RKN induces the expression of numerous class-A heat shock factor (HsfA) genes in resistant tomato plants. Silencing <i>HsfA1a</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated resistance, apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, and the transcription of <i>whitefly induced 1</i> (<i>Wfi1</i>), which encodes a respiratory burst oxidase homolog. HsfA1a regulates <i>Wfi1</i> transcription by binding to the <i>Wfi1</i> promoter, and silencing of <i>Wfi1</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated resistance. HsfA1a and Wfi1 are involved in Mi-1.2-triggered Hsp90 accumulation and basal defense in susceptible tomato. Thus, HsfA–1aWfi1-dependent ROS signaling functions as a crucial regulator of plant defense responses.</p>

Involvement of Adapter Protein Complex 4 in Hypersensitive Cell Death Induced by Avirulent Bacteria<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant immunity to avirulent bacterial pathogens is associated with subcellular membrane dynamics including fusion between the vacuolar and plasma membranes, resulting in hypersensitive cell death. Here, we report that ADAPTOR PROTEIN COMPLEX-4 (AP-4) subunits are involved in plant immunity associated with hypersensitive cell death. We isolated a mutant with a defect in resistance to an avirulent strain of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pto</i>) DC3000 <i>avrRpm1</i> from a vacuolar protein sorting mutant library of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The mutant was identical to <i>gfs4-1</i>, which has a mutation in the gene encoding the AP-4 subunit AP4B. Thus, we focused on AP4B and another subunit, AP4E. All of the mutants (<i>ap4b-3</i>, <i>ap4b-4</i>, <i>ap4e-1</i>, and <i>ap4e-2</i>) were defective in hypersensitive cell death and resistance to <i>Pto</i> DC3000 with the type III effector AvrRpm1 or AvrRpt2, both of which are recognized on the plasma membrane, while they showed slightly enhanced susceptibility to the type-III-secretion-deficient <i>P. syringae</i> strain <i>hrcC</i>. On the other hand, both <i>ap4b-3</i> and <i>ap4b-4</i> showed no defect in resistance to <i>Pto</i> DC3000 with the type III effector AvrRps4, which is recognized in the cytosol and does not induce hypersensitive cell death. Upon infection with <i>Pto</i> DC3000 <i>avrRpt2</i>, the <i>ap4b-3</i> and <i>ap4b-4</i> leaf cells did not show fusion between vacuolar and plasma membranes, whereas the wild-type leaf cells did. These results suggest that AP-4 contributes to cell death-associated immunity, possibly via membrane fusion, after type III effector-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion on the plasma membrane.</p>

The Brassicaceae Family Displays Divergent, Shoot-Skewed NLR Resistance Gene Expression
<p>Nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat resistance genes (NLRs) allow plants to detect microbial effectors. We hypothesized that NLR expression patterns could reflect organ-specific differences in effector challenge and tested this by carrying out a meta-analysis of expression data for 1,235 NLRs from nine plant species. We found stable NLR root/shoot expression ratios within species, suggesting organ-specific hardwiring of NLR expression patterns in anticipation of distinct challenges. Most monocot and dicot plant species preferentially expressed NLRs in roots. In contrast, Brassicaceae species, including oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) and the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), were unique in showing NLR expression skewed toward the shoot across multiple phylogenetically distinct groups of NLRs. The Brassicaceae are also outliers in the sense that they have lost the common symbiosis signaling pathway, which enables intracellular infection by root symbionts. While it is unclear if these two events are related, the NLR expression shift identified here suggests that the Brassicaceae may have evolved unique pattern-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion receptors and antimicrobial root metabolites to substitute for NLR protection. Such innovations in root protection could potentially be exploited in crop rotation schemes or for enhancing root defense systems of non-Brassicaceae crops.</p>

Branched Pectic Galactan in Phloem-Sieve-Element Cell Walls: Implications for Cell Mechanics
<p>A major question in plant biology concerns the specification and functional differentiation of cell types. This is in the context of constraints imposed by networks of cell walls that both adhere cells and contribute to the form and function of developing organs. Here, we report the identification of a glycan epitope that is specific to phloem sieve element cell walls in several systems. A monoclonal antibody, designated LM26, binds to the cell wall of phloem sieve elements in stems of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>Miscanthus</i> x <i>giganteus</i>, and notably sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>) roots where phloem identification is an important factor for the study of phloem unloading of Suc. Using microarrays of synthetic oligosaccharides, the LM26 epitope has been identified as a β-1,6-galactosyl substitution of β-1,4-galactan requiring more than three backbone residues for optimized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion. This branched galactan structure has previously been identified in garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) bulbs in which the LM26 epitope is widespread throughout most cell walls including those of phloem cells. Garlic bulb cell wall material has been used to confirm the association of the LM26 epitope with cell wall pectic rhamnogalacturonan-I polysaccharides. In the phloem tissues of grass stems, the LM26 epitope has a complementary pattern to that of the LM5 linear β-1,4-galactan epitope, which is detected only in companion cell walls. Mechanical probing of transverse sections of <i>M</i>. x <i>giganteus</i> stems and leaves by atomic force microscopy indicates that phloem sieve element cell walls have a lower indentation modulus (indicative of higher elasticity) than companion cell walls.</p>

Glutathione Transferase U13 Functions in Pathogen-Triggered Glucosinolate Metabolism<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Glutathione (GSH) and indole glucosinolates (IGs) exert key functions in the immune system of the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Appropriate GSH levels are important for execution of both pre- and postinvasive disease resistance mechanisms to invasive pathogens, whereas an intact PENETRATION2 (PEN2)-pathway for IG metabolism is essential for preinvasive resistance in this species. Earlier indirect evidence suggested that the latter pathway involves conjugation of GSH with unstable products of IG metabolism and further processing of the resulting adducts to biologically active molecules. Here we describe the identification of Glutathione-<i>S</i>-Transferase class-tau member 13 (GSTU13) as an indispensable component of the PEN2 immune pathway for IG metabolism. <i>gstu13</i> mutant plants are defective in the pathogen-triggered biosynthesis of end products of the PEN2 pathway, including 4-O-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosyl-indol-3-yl formamide, indole-3-ylmethyl amine, and raphanusamic acid. In line with this metabolic defect, lack of functional GSTU13 results in enhanced disease susceptibility toward several fungal pathogens including <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>, <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>, and <i>Plectosphaerella cucumerina</i>. Seedlings of <i>gstu13</i> plants fail also to deposit the (1,3)-β-glucan cell wall polymer, callose, after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of the bacterial flg22 epitope. We show that GSTU13 mediates specifically the role of GSH in IG metabolism without noticeable impact on other immune functions of this tripeptide. We postulate that GSTU13 connects GSH with the pathogen-triggered PEN2 pathway for IG metabolism to deliver metabolites that may have numerous functions in the innate immune system of Arabidopsis.</p>

The RNA Editing Factor SlORRM4 Is Required for Normal Fruit Ripening in Tomato
<p>RNA editing plays a key posttranscriptional role in gene expression. Existing studies on cytidine-to-uridine RNA editing in plants have focused on maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the importance and regulation of RNA editing in several critical agronomic processes are not well understood, a notable example of which is fruit ripening. Here, we analyzed the expression profile of 33 RNA editing factors and identified 11 putative tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) fruit ripening-related factors. A rapid virus-induced gene silencing assay indicated that the organelle RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion motif-containing protein SlORRM4 affected tomato fruit ripening. Knocking out SlORRM4 expression using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome editing strategy delayed tomato fruit ripening by lowering respiratory rate and ethylene production. Additionally, the expression of numerous genes associated with fruit ripening and mitochondrial functions changed significantly when <i>SlORRM4</i> was knocked out. Moreover, the loss of <i>SlORRM4</i> function significantly reduced RNA editing of many mitochondrial transcripts, leading to low-level expression of some core subunits that are critical for mitochondrial complex assembly (i.e. Nad3, Cytc1, and COX II). Taken together, these results indicate that SlORRM4 is involved in RNA editing of transcripts in ripening fruit that influence mitochondrial function and key aspects of fruit ripening.</p>

Argonaute 8 (AGO8) Mediates the Elicitation of Direct Defenses against Herbivory
<p>In <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i>, specific RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdR1) and the Dicer-like (DCL3 and DCL4) proteins are recruited during herbivore attack to mediate the regulation of defense responses. However, the identity and role(s) of Argonautes (AGOs) involved in herbivory remain unknown. Of the 11 AGOs in the <i>N. attenuata</i> genome, we silenced the expression of 10. Plants silenced in <i>NaAGO8</i> expression grew normally but were highly susceptible to herbivore attack. Larvae of <i>Manduca sexta</i> grew faster when consuming inverted-repeat stable transformants (ir<i>AGO8</i>) plants but did not differ from the wild type when consuming plants silenced in <i>AGO1</i> (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>), <i>AGO2</i>, <i>AGO4</i> (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>), <i>AGO7</i>, or <i>AGO10</i> expression. ir<i>AGO8</i> plants were significantly compromised in herbivore-induced levels of defense metabolites such as nicotine, phenolamides, and diterpenoid glycosides. Time-course analyses revealed extensively altered microRNA profiles and the reduced accumulation of <i>MYB8</i> transcripts and of the associated genes of the phenolamide and phenylpropanoid pathways as well as the nicotine biosynthetic pathway. A possible AGO8-modulated microRNA-messenger RNA target network was inferred. Furthermore, comparative analysis of domains revealed the diversity of AGO conformations, particularly in the small RNA-binding pocket, which may influence substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion/binding and functional specificity. We infer that AGO8 plays a central role in the induction of direct defenses by modulating several regulatory nodes in the defense signaling network during herbivore response. Thus, our study identifies the effector AGO of the herbivore-induced small RNA machinery, which in <i>N. attenuata</i> now comprises RdR1, DCL3/4, and AGO8.</p>

<p>The activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) is one of the earliest responses triggered by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of several microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) in plants. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PI-PLC gene family is composed of nine members. Previous studies suggested a role for PLC2 in MAMP-triggered immunity, as it is rapidly phosphorylated in vivo upon treatment with the bacterial MAMP flg22. Here, we analyzed the role of PLC2 in plant immunity using an artificial microRNA to silence <i>PLC2</i> expression in Arabidopsis. We found that <i>PLC2</i>-silenced plants are more susceptible to the type III secretion system-deficient bacterial strain <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000 <i>hrcC<sup>−</sup></i> and to the nonadapted pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) powdery mildew <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>. However, <i>PLC2</i>-silenced plants display normal susceptibility to virulent (<i>Pst</i> DC3000) and avirulent (<i>Pst</i> DC3000 AvrRPM1) <i>P. syringae</i> strains, conserving typical hypersensitive response features. In response to flg22, <i>PLC2</i>-silenced plants maintain wild-type mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and <i>PHI1</i>, <i>WRKY33</i>, and <i>FRK1</i> immune marker gene expression but have reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent responses such as callose deposition and stomatal closure. Accordingly, the generation of ROS upon flg22 treatment is compromised in the <i>PLC2</i>-defficient plants, suggesting an effect of PLC2 in a branch of MAMP-triggered immunity and nonhost resistance that involves early ROS-regulated processes. Consistently, PLC2 associates with the NADPH oxidase RBOHD, suggesting its potential regulation by PLC2.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p>Plastid transformation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in plastid biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a plastid-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that plastid transformation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the plastid-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. Plastid transformation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two plastid transformation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced plastid transformation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis plastid transformation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to plastid transformation provides a rational template to implement plastid transformation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

BcXYG1, a Secreted Xyloglucanase from <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, Triggers Both Cell Death and Plant Immune Responses
<p>In search of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> cell death-inducing proteins, we found a xyloglucanase (BcXYG1) that induced strong necrosis and a resistance response in dicot plants. Expression of the <i>BcXYG1</i> gene was strongly induced during the first 12 h post inoculation, and analysis of disease dynamics using PathTrack showed that a <i>B. cinerea</i> strain overexpressing <i>BcXYG1</i> produced early local necrosis, supporting a role of BcXYG1 as an early cell death-inducing factor. The xyloglucanase activity of BcXYG1 was not necessary for the induction of necrosis and plant resistance, as a mutant of BcXYG1 lacking the xyloglucanase enzymatic activity retained both functions. Residues in two exposed loops on the surface of BcXYG1 were found to be necessary for the induction of cell death but not to induce plant resistance. Further analyses showed that BcXYG1 is apoplastic and possibly interacts with the proteins of the plant cell membrane and also that the BcXYG1 cell death-promoting signal is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases BAK1 and SOBIR1. Our findings support the role of cell death-inducing proteins in establishing the infection of necrotrophic pathogens and highlight the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of fungal apoplastic proteins by the plant immune system as an important mechanism of resistance against this class of pathogens.</p>

Analysis of the ZAR1 Immune Complex Reveals Determinants for Immunity and Molecular Interactions<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants depend on innate immunity to prevent disease. Plant pathogenic bacteria, like <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>, use the type III secretion system as a molecular syringe to inject type III secreted effector (T3SE) proteins in plants. The primary function of most T3SEs is to suppress immunity; however, the plant can evolve nucleotide-binding domain-leucine-rich repeat domain-containing proteins to recognize specific T3SEs. The AtZAR1 NLR induces strong defense responses against <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>X. campestris</i>. The <i>P. syringae</i> T3SE HopZ1a is an acetyltransferase that acetylates the pseudokinase AtZED1 and triggers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion by AtZAR1. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that lead to AtZAR1-induced immunity in response to HopZ1a. We established a transient expression system in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> to study detailed interactions among HopZ1a, AtZED1, and AtZAR1. We show that the AtZAR1 immune pathway is conserved in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and identify AtZAR1 domains, and residues in AtZAR1 and AtZED1, that are important for immunity and protein-protein interactions in planta and in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>). We show that the coiled-coil domain of AtZAR1 oligomerizes, and this domain acts as a signal to induce immunity. This detailed analysis of the AtZAR1-AtZED1 protein complex provides a better understanding of the immune signaling hub controlled by AtZAR1.</p>

A Lectin Receptor-Like Kinase Mediates Pattern-Triggered Salicylic Acid Signaling
<p>Plant surface-localized pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion receptors (PRRs) perceive conserved microbial features, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), resulting in disease resistance. PAMP perception leads to calcium influx, MAPK activation, a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated by RbohD, accumulation of the defense hormone salicylic acid (SA), and callose deposition. Lectin receptor-like kinases (LecRKs) belong to a specific PRR family and are important players in plant innate immunity. Here, we report that LecRK-IX.2 is a positive regulator of PRR-triggered immunity. Pathogen infection activated the transcription of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>LecRK-IX.2</i>, and the <i>LecRK-IX.2</i> knockout lines exhibited enhanced susceptibility to virulent <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. In addition, LecRK-IX.2 is capable of inducing RbohD phosphorylation, likely by recruiting calcium-dependent protein kinases to trigger ROS production in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of <i>LecRK-IX.2</i> resulted in elevated ROS and SA and enhanced systemic acquired resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. Our data highlight the importance of LecRKs in plant immune signaling and SA accumulation.</p>

The C-Domain of Oleuropein <i>β</i>-Glucosidase Assists in Protein Folding and Sequesters the Enzyme in Nucleus<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Oleuropein, a terpene-derived glycosylated secoiridoid biosynthesized exclusively by members of the Oleaceae family, is involved in a two-component defense system comprising a β-glucosidase that activates oleuropein into a toxic glutaraldehyde-like structure. Oleuropein and its deglycosylated derivatives have high pharmaceutical interest. In this study we determined that the in planta heterologous expressed OeGLU, an oleuropein-specific β-glucosidase from olive (<i>Olea europaea</i>), had enzymatic kinetics similar to the olive native enzyme. The C terminus encompassing the nuclear localization signal sequesters the enzyme in the nucleus, and predetermines the protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion and homodimerization. Biochemical analysis revealed that OeGLU is a homomultimer with high <i>M</i><sub>r</sub>. In silico prediction modeling of the complex structure and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses revealed that the C terminus of OeGLU is essential for the proper assembly of an octameric form, a key conformational feature that determines the activity of the enzyme. Our results demonstrate that intrinsic characteristics of the OeGLU ensure separation from oleuropein and keep the dual-partner defensive system conditionally inactive. Upon cell destruction, the dual-partner defense system is activated and olive massively releases the arsenal of defense.</p>

Regulatory Phosphorylation of Bacterial-Type PEP Carboxylase by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Dependent Protein Kinase RcCDPK1 in Developing Castor Oil Seeds
<p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a tightly controlled cytosolic enzyme situated at a crucial branch point of central plant metabolism. In developing castor oil seeds (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) a novel, allosterically desensitized 910-kD Class-2 PEPC hetero-octameric complex, arises from a tight interaction between 107-kD plant-type PEPC and 118-kD bacterial-type (BTPC) subunits. The native Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) responsible for in vivo inhibitory phosphorylation of Class-2 PEPC’s BTPC subunit’s at Ser-451 was highly purified from COS and identified as RcCDPK1 (XP_002526815) by mass spectrometry. Heterologously expressed RcCDPK1 catalyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, inhibitory phosphorylation of BTPC at Ser-451 while exhibiting: (<i>i</i>) a pair of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites with identical dissociation constants of 5.03 μM, (<i>ii</i>) a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift, and (<i>iii</i>) a marked Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent hydrophobicity. Pull-down experiments established the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interaction of N-terminal GST-tagged RcCDPK1 with BTPC. RcCDPK1-Cherry localized to the cytosol and nucleus of tobacco bright yellow-2 cells, but colocalized with mitochondrial-surface associated BTPC-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein when both fusion proteins were coexpressed. Deletion analyses demonstrated that although its N-terminal variable domain plays an essential role in optimizing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent RcCDPK1 autophosphorylation and BTPC transphosphorylation activity, it is not critical for in vitro or in vivo target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPK4 and soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) CDPKβ are RcCDPK1 orthologs that effectively phosphorylated castor BTPC at Ser-451. Overall, the results highlight a potential link between cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and the posttranslational control of respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> refixation and anaplerotic photosynthate partitioning in support of storage oil and protein biosynthesis in developing COS.</p>

The Membrane Transport System of the Guard Cell and Its Integration for Stomatal Dynamics
<p>Stomatal guard cells are widely recognized as the premier plant cell model for membrane transport, signaling, and homeostasis. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion is rooted in half a century of research into ion transport across the plasma and vacuolar membranes of guard cells that drive stomatal movements and the signaling mechanisms that regulate them. Stomatal guard cells surround pores in the epidermis of plant leaves, controlling the aperture of the pore to balance CO<sub>2</sub> entry into the leaf for photosynthesis with water loss via transpiration. The position of guard cells in the epidermis is ideally suited for cellular and subcellular research, and their sensitivity to endogenous signals and environmental stimuli makes them a primary target for physiological studies. Stomata underpin the challenges of water availability and crop production that are expected to unfold over the next 20 to 30 years. A quantitative understanding of how ion transport is integrated and controlled is key to meeting these challenges and to engineering guard cells for improved water use efficiency and agricultural yields.</p>

An Organelle RNA Recognition Motif Protein Is Required for Photosystem II Subunit <i>psbF</i> Transcript Editing
<p>Loss-of-function mutations in ORGANELLE RNA RECOGNITION MOTIF PROTEIN6 (ORRM6) result in the near absence of RNA editing of <i>psbF</i>-C77 and the reduction in <i>accD</i>-C794 editing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The <i>orrm6</i> mutants have decreased levels of photosystem II (PSII) proteins, especially PsbF, lower PSII activity, pale green pigmentation, smaller leaf and plant sizes, and retarded growth. Stable expression of <i>ORRM6</i> rescues the <i>orrm6</i> editing defects and mutant phenotype. Unlike ORRM1, the other known ORRM plastid editing factor, ORRM6, does not contain RNA editing interacting protein/multiple organellar RNA editing factor (RIP/MORF) boxes, which are required for ORRM1 to interact with site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein editing factors. ORRM6 interacts with RIP1/MORF8, RIP2/MORF2, and RIP9/MORF9, known components of RNA editosomes. While some plastid RRM proteins are involved in other forms of RNA processing and translation, the primary function of ORRM6 is evidently to mediate <i>psbF</i>-C77 editing, like the essential site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein LOW PSII ACCUMULATION66. Stable expression in the <i>orrm6</i> mutants of a nucleus-encoded, plastid-targeted PsbF protein from a <i>psbF</i> gene carrying a T at nucleotide 77 significantly increases leaf and plant sizes, chlorophyll content, and PSII activity. These transformants demonstrate that plastid RNA editing can be bypassed through the expression of nucleus-encoded, edited forms of plastid genes.</p>

Comparative Analysis of Light-Harvesting Antennae and State Transition in <i>chlorina</i> and cpSRP Mutants
<p>State transitions in photosynthesis provide for the dynamic allocation of a mobile fraction of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) to photosystem II (PSII) in state I and to photosystem I (PSI) in state II. In the state I-to-state II transition, LHCII is phosphorylated by STN7 and associates with PSI to favor absorption cross-section of PSI. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with defects in chlorophyll (Chl) b biosynthesis or in the chloroplast signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion particle (cpSRP) machinery to study the flexible formation of PS-LHC supercomplexes. Intriguingly, we found that impaired Chl b biosynthesis in <i>chlorina1-2</i> (<i>ch1-2</i>) led to preferentially stabilized LHCI rather than LHCII, while the contents of both LHCI and LHCII were equally depressed in the cpSRP43-deficient mutant (<i>chaos</i>). In view of recent findings on the modified state transitions in LHCI-deficient mutants (Benson et al., 2015), the <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> mutants were used to assess the influence of varying LHCI/LHCII antenna size on state transitions. Under state II conditions, LHCII-PSI supercomplexes were not formed in both <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> plants. LHCII phosphorylation was drastically reduced in <i>ch1-2</i>, and the inactivation of STN7 correlates with the lack of state transitions. In contrast, phosphorylated LHCII in <i>chaos</i> was observed to be exclusively associated with PSII complexes, indicating a lack of mobile LHCII in <i>chaos</i>. Thus, the comparative analysis of <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> mutants provides new evidence for the flexible organization of LHCs and enhances our understanding of the reversible allocation of LHCII to the two photosystems.</p>

A Legume TOR Protein Kinase Regulates <i>Rhizobium</i> Symbiosis and Is Essential for Infection and Nodule Development
<p>The target of rapamycin (<i>TOR</i>) protein kinase regulates metabolism, growth, and life span in yeast, animals, and plants in coordination with nutrient status and environmental conditions. The nutrient-dependent nature of <i>TOR</i> functionality makes this kinase a putative regulator of symbiotic associations involving nutrient acquisition. However, <i>TOR</i>’s role in these processes remains to be understood. Here, we uncovered the role of <i>TOR</i> during the bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>)-<i>Rhizobium tropici</i> (<i>Rhizobium</i>) symbiotic interaction. <i>TOR</i> was expressed in all tested bean tissues, with higher transcript levels in the root meristems and senesced nodules. We showed <i>TOR</i> promoter expression along the progressing infection thread and in the infected cells of mature nodules. Posttranscriptional gene silencing of <i>TOR</i> using RNA interference (RNAi) showed that this gene is involved in lateral root elongation and root cell organization and also alters the density, size, and number of root hairs. The suppression of <i>TOR</i> transcripts also affected infection thread progression and associated cortical cell divisions, resulting in a drastic reduction of nodule numbers. <i>TOR</i>-RNAi resulted in reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation and altered <i>CyclinD1</i> and <i>CyclinD3</i> expression, which are crucial factors for infection thread progression and nodule organogenesis. Enhanced expression of <i>TOR</i>-regulated <i>ATG</i> genes in <i>TOR</i>-RNAi roots suggested that <i>TOR</i> plays a role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of <i>Rhizobium</i> as a symbiont. Together, these data suggest that <i>TOR</i> plays a vital role in the establishment of root nodule symbiosis in the common bean.</p>

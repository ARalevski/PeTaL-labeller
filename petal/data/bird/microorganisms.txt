Lectins modulate the microbiota of social amoebae
<p>The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> maintains a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>iome during multicellular development; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> are carried in migrating slugs and as endosymbionts within amoebae and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spore</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l carriage and endosymbiosis are induced by the secreted lectin discoidin I that binds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, protects them from extracellular killing, and alters their retention within amoebae. This altered handling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> also occurs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> coated by plant lectins and leads to DNA transfer from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> to amoebae. Thus, lectins alter the cellular response of <i>D. discoideum</i> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> to establish the amoebae’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>iome. Mammalian cells can also maintain intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> when presented with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> coated with lectins, so heterologous lectins may induce endosymbiosis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Our results suggest that endogenous or environmental lectins may influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>iome homeostasis across eukaryotic phylogeny.</p>

An intramembrane sensory circuit monitors sortase A–mediated processing of streptococcal adhesins
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l adhesins mediate adhesion to substrates and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> formation. Adhesins of the LPXTG family are posttranslationally processed by the cell membrane–localized peptidase sortase A, which cleaves the LPXTG motif. This generates a short C-terminal peptide (C-pep) that remains in the cell membrane, whereas the mature adhesin is incorporated into the cell wall. Genes encoding adhesins of the oral bacterium <i>Streptococcus gordonii</i> were differentially expressed depending on whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> were isolated from saliva or dental plaque and appeared to be coordinately regulated. Deletion of <i>sspA</i> and <i>sspB (sspAB)</i>, both of which encode LPXTG-containing adhesins, unexpectedly enhanced adhesion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> formation. C-peps produced from a model LPXTG-containing adhesin localized to the cell membrane and bound to and inhibited the intramembrane sensor histidine kinase SGO_1180, thus preventing activation of the cognate response regulator SGO_1181. The absence of SspAB C-peps induced the expression of the <i>scaCBA</i> operon encoding the lipoprotein adhesin ScaA, which was sufficient to preserve and even enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> formation. This C-pep–driven regulatory circuit also exists in pathogenic streptococci and is likely conserved among Gram-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>. This quality control mechanism ensures that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> can form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>s under diverse environmental conditions and may play a role in optimizing adhesion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> formation.</p>

Generation of influenza A viruses as live but replication-incompetent virus vaccines
<p>The conversion of life-threatening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es into live but a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ent vaccines represents a revolution in vaccinology. In a proof-of-principle study, we expanded the genetic code of the genome of influenza A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> via a transgenic cell line containing orthogonal translation machinery. This generated premature termination codon (PTC)–harboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es that exerted full infectivity but were replication-incompetent in conventional cells. Genome-wide optimization of the sites for incorporation of multiple PTCs resulted in highly reproductive and genetically stable progeny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es in transgenic cells. In mouse, ferret, and guinea pig models, vaccination with PTC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es elicited robust humoral, mucosal, and T cell–mediated immunity against antigenically distinct influenza <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es and even neutralized existing infecting strains. The methods presented here may become a general approach for generating live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> vaccines that can be adapted to almost any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>.</p>

Predicting reservoir hosts and arthropod vectors from evolutionary signatures in RNA virus genomes
<p>Identifying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al origins of RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es requires years of field and laboratory studies that stall responses to emerging infectious diseases. Using large genomic and ecological datasets, we demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al reservoirs and the existence and identity of arthropod vectors can be predicted directly from viral genome sequences via machine learning. We illustrate the ability of these models to predict the epidemiology of diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es across most human-infective families of single-stranded RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, including 69 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es with previously elusive or never-investigated reservoirs or vectors.

Giant viruses with an expanded complement of translation system components
<p>The discovery of giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es blurred the sharp division between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es and cellular life. Giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> genomes encode proteins considered as signatures of cellular organisms, particularly translation system components, prompting hypotheses that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es derived from a fourth domain of cellular life. Here we report the discovery of a group of giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es (Klosneu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es) in metagenomic data. Compared with other giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, the Klosneu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es encode an expanded translation machinery, including aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetases with specificities for all 20 amino acids. Notwithstanding the prevalence of translation system components, comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of these genes indicates that Klosneu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es did not evolve from a cellular ancestor but rather are derived from a much smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> through extensive gain of host genes.</p>

Light Acclimation of the Colonial Green Alga <i>Botryococcus braunii</i> Strain Showa
<p>In contrast to single cellular species, detailed information is lacking on the processes of photosynthetic acclimation for colonial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e, although these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e are important for biofuel production, ecosystem biodiversity, and wastewater treatment. To investigate differences between single cellular and colonial species, we studied the regulation of photosynthesis and photoprotection during photoacclimation for the colonial green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong> <i>Botryococcus braunii</i> and made a comparison with the properties of the single cellular species <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. We show that <i>B. braunii</i> shares some high-light (HL) photoacclimation strategies with <i>C. reinhardtii</i> and other frequently studied green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e: decreased chlorophyll content, increased free carotenoid content, and increased nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). Additionally, <i>B. braunii</i> has unique HL photoacclimation strategies, related to its colonial form: strong internal shading by an increase of the colony size and the accumulation of extracellular echinenone (a ketocarotenoid). HL colonies are larger and more spatially heterogenous than low-light colonies. Compared with surface cells, cells deeper inside the colony have increased pigmentation and larger photosystem II antenna size. The core of the largest of the HL colonies does not contain living cells. In contrast with <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, but similar to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>-forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e, NPQ capacity is substantial in low light. In HL, NPQ amplitude increases, but kinetics are unchanged. We discuss possible causes of the different acclimation responses of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> and <i>B. braunii</i>. Knowledge of the specific photoacclimation processes for this colonial green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong> further extends the view of the diversity of photoacclimation strategies in photosynthetic organisms.</p>

Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are spread from plant to plant by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es manipulate the release of plant volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on plants infected with these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (CMV) and one of its host plants, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, plants infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in plant tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected plants engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Therefore, the frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> acquisition and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected plants than on CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected plants. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy plants infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced tobacco plants, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of RNAi protein to increase plant ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

<i>Foxtail mosaic virus</i>: A Viral Vector for Protein Expression in Cereals
<p>Rapid and cost-effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-derived transient expression systems for plants are invaluable in elucidating gene function and are particularly useful in plant species for which transformation-based methods are unavailable or are too time and labor demanding, such as wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-mediated overexpression (VOX) vectors based on <i>Barley stripe mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> and <i>Wheat streak mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> described previously for these species are incapable of expressing free recombinant proteins of more than 150 to 250 amino acids, are not suited for high-throughput screens, and have other limitations. In this study, we report the development of a VOX vector based on a monopartite single-stranded positive sense RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, <i>Foxtail mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (genus <i>Potex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i>). In this vector, PV101, the gene of interest was inserted downstream of the duplicated subgenomic promoter of the viral coat protein gene, and the corresponding protein was expressed in its free form. The vector allowed the expression of a 239-amino acid-long GFP in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-inoculated and upper uninoculated (systemic) leaves of wheat and maize and directed the systemic expression of a larger approximately 600-amino acid protein, GUSPlus, in maize. Moreover, we demonstrated that PV101 can be used for in planta expression and functional analysis of apoplastic pathogen effector proteins such as the host-specific toxin ToxA of <i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i>. Therefore, this VOX vector opens possibilities for functional genomics studies in two important cereal crops.</p>

An Aphid Effector Targets Trafficking Protein VPS52 in a Host-Specific Manner to Promote Virulence
<p>Plant- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al-feeding insects secrete saliva inside their hosts, containing effectors, which may promote nutrient release and suppress immunity. Although for plant pathogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>es it is well established that effectors target host proteins to modulate host cell processes and promote disease, the host cell targets of herbivorous insects remain elusive. Here, we show that the existing plant pathogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>e effector paradigm can be extended to herbivorous insects in that effector-target interactions inside host cells modify critical host processes to promote plant susceptibility. We showed that the effector Mp1 from <i>Myzus persicae</i> associates with the host Vacuolar Protein Sorting Associated Protein52 (VPS52). Using natural variants, we provide a strong link between effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence activity and association with VPS52, and show that the association is highly specific to <i>M</i>. <i>persicae</i>-host interactions. Also, coexpression of Mp1, but not Mp1-like variants, specifically with host VPS52s resulted in effector relocalization to vesicle-like structures that associate with prevacuolar compartments. We show that high VPS52 levels negatively impact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence, and that aphids are able to reduce VPS52 levels during infestation, indicating that VPS52 is an important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence target. Our work is an important step forward in understanding, at the molecular level, how a major agricultural pest promotes susceptibility during infestation of crop plants. We give evidence that an herbivorous insect employs effectors that interact with host proteins as part of an effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence strategy, and that these effectors likely function in a species-specific manner.</p>

Role of Glycosyltransferases in Pollen Wall Primexine Formation and Exine Patterning
<p>The pollen cell wall is important for protection of male sperm from physical stresses and consists of an inner gametophyte-derived intine layer and a sporophyte-derived exine layer. The polymeric constituents of the robust exine are termed sporopollenin. The mechanisms by which sporopollenin is anchored onto <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es and polymerized in specific patterns are unknown, but the primexine, a transient cell wall matrix formed on the surface of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es at the late tetrad stage, is hypothesized to play a key role. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>spongy</i> (<i>spg</i>) and <i>uneven pattern of exine</i> (<i>upex</i>) mutants exhibit defective and irregular exine patterns. <i>SPG2</i> (synonymous with <i>IRREGULAR XYLEM9-LIKE</i> [<i>IRX9L</i>]) encodes a family GT43 glycosyltransferase involved in xylan backbone biosynthesis, while <i>UPEX1</i> encodes a family GT31 glycosyltransferase likely involved in galactosylation of arabinogalactan proteins. Imaging of developing <i>irx9l</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es showed that the earliest detectable defect was in primexine formation. Furthermore, wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es contained primexine-localized epitopes indicative of the presence of xylan, but these were absent in <i>irx9l</i>. These data, together with the <i>spg</i> phenotype of a mutant in <i>IRX14L</i>, which also plays a role in xylan backbone elongation, indicate the presence of xylan in pollen wall primexine, which plays a role in exine patterning on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>e surface. We observed an aberrant primexine and irregular patterns of incipient sporopollenin deposition in <i>upex1</i>, suggesting that primexine-localized arabinogalactan proteins could play roles in sporopollenin adhesion and patterning early in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>e wall development. Our data provide new insights into the biochemical and functional properties of the primexine component of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>e cell wall.</p>

Heterogeneity in efflux pump expression predisposes antibiotic-resistant cells to mutation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibiot</span></strong>ic resistance is often the result of mutations that block drug activity; however, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> also evade <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibiot</span></strong>ics by transiently expressing genes such as multidrug efflux pumps. A crucial question is whether transient resistance can promote permanent genetic changes. Previous studies have established that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibiot</span></strong>ic treatment can select tolerant cells that then mutate to achieve permanent resistance. Whether these mutations result from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibiot</span></strong>ic stress or preexist within the population is unclear. To address this question, we focused on the multidrug pump AcrAB-TolC. Using time-lapse microscopy, we found that cells with higher <i>acrAB</i> expression have lower expression of the DNA mismatch repair gene <i>mutS</i>, lower growth rates, and higher mutation frequencies. Thus, transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibiot</span></strong>ic resistance from elevated <i>acrAB</i> expression can promote spontaneous mutations within single cells.</p>

Universal protection against influenza infection by a multidomain antibody to influenza hemagglutinin

Incomplete host immunity favors the evolution of virulence in an emergent pathogen
<p>Immune memory evolved to protect hosts from reinfection, but incomplete responses that allow future reinfection may inadvertently select for more-harmful pathogens. We present empirical and modeling evidence that incomplete immunity promotes the evolution of higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence in a natural host-pathogen system. We performed sequential infections of house finches with <i>Mycoplasma gallisepticum</i> strains of various levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l strains generated stronger host protection against reinfection than less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ent strains and thus excluded less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ent strains from infecting previously exposed hosts. In a two-strain model, the resulting fitness advantage selected for an almost twofold increase in pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence. Thus, the same immune systems that protect hosts from infection can concomitantly drive the evolution of more-harmful pathogens in nature.</p>

Identification of a New Host Factor Required for Antiviral RNAi and Amplification of Viral siRNAs
<p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are processed from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-specific dsRNA to direct antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) in diverse eukaryotic hosts. We have recently performed a sensitized genetic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and identified two related phospholipid flippases required for antiviral RNAi and the amplification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-derived siRNAs by plant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase1 (RDR1) and RDR6. Here we report the identification and cloning of <i>ANTIVIRAL RNAI</i>-<i>DEFECTIVE2</i> (<i>AVI2</i>) from the same genetic screen. <i>AVI2</i> encodes a multispan transmembrane protein broadly conserved in plants and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with two homologous human proteins known as magnesium transporters. We show that <i>avi2</i> mutant plants display no developmental defects and develop severe disease symptoms after infection with a mutant <i>Cucumber mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (CMV) defective in RNAi suppression. <i>AVI2</i> is induced by CMV infection, particularly in veins, and is required for antiviral RNAi and RDR6-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs. AVI2 is also necessary for Dicer-like2-mediated amplification of 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs induced in <i>dcl4</i> mutant plants by infection, but dispensable for RDR6-dependent biogenesis of endogenous transacting siRNAs. Further genetic studies illustrate that AVI2 plays a partially redundant role with AVI2H, the most closely related member in the <i>AVI2</i> gene family, in RDR1-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs and the endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-activated siRNAs (vasi-RNAs). Interestingly, we discovered a specific genetic interaction of AVI2 with AVI1 flippase that is critical for plant development. We propose that AVI1 and AVI2 participate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced formation of the RDR1/RDR6-specific, membrane-bound RNA synthesis compartment, essential for the biogenesis of highly abundant viral siRNAs and vasi-RNAs.</p>

Turnip Mosaic Virus Counteracts Selective Autophagy of the Viral Silencing Suppressor HCpro<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway and has emerged as a key mechanism of antiviral immunity in metazoans, including the selective elimination of viral components. In turn, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are able to escape and modulate autophagy for enhanced pathogenicity. Whether host autophagic responses and viral countermeasures play similar roles in plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> interactions is not well understood. Here, we have identified selective autophagy as antiviral pathway during plant infection with turnip mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (TuMV), a positive-stranded RNA poty<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>. We show that the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 suppresses viral accumulation by targeting the viral RNA silencing suppressor helper-component proteinase (HCpro), presumably in association with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced RNA granules. Intriguingly, TuMV seems to antagonize NBR1-dependent autophagy during infection by the activity of distinct viral proteins, thereby limiting its antiviral capacity. We also found that NBR1-independent bulk autophagy prevents premature plant death, thus extending the lifespan of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> reservoirs and particle production. Together, our study highlights a conserved role of selective autophagy in antiviral immunity and suggests the evolvement of viral protein functions to inhibit autophagy processes, despite a potential trade-off in host survival.</p>

An Improved <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is used extensively for gene function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with silencing conducted through stable transformation, but many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-silencing vectors, especially in grasses, induce only transient silencing phenotypes. A major reason for transient phenotypes is the instability of the foreign gene fragment (insert) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the development of a <i>Brome mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (BMV)-based vector that better maintains inserts through modification of the original BMV vector RNA sequence. Modification of the BMV RNA3 sequence yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained <i>phytoene desaturase</i> and <i>heat shock protein70-1</i> (<i>HSP70-1</i>) inserts in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Longer maintenance of inserts was correlated with greater target gene silencing and more extensive visible silencing phenotypes displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more leaves. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in <i>N. benthamiana</i> after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in this intermediate host used to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> inoculum for grass hosts. For <i>HSP70</i>, silencing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target gene knockdown and not a general effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> infection. The cause of the increased insert stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in grasses, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.</p>

Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite infection of developing honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) pupae
<p>The ectoparasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. <i>Varroa</i> interacts with honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, immunosuppression of the developing honey bee hosts by <i>Varroa</i> has been proposed to explain the synergy between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee immune suppression by <i>V. destructor</i> is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced <i>V. destructor</i> mites on immune gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of deformed wing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in the developing bees. Our data on different immune genes show little evidence for immunosuppression of honey bees by <i>V. destructor</i>. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative immune gene expression and deformed wing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not immunosuppression may contribute to the synergy between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee immune genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple immune genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee immune system.</p>

Experimental evolution of a fungal pathogen into a gut symbiont
<p>Gut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>es live in symbiosis with their hosts, but how mutualistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>e interactions emerge is not understood. By adaptively evolving the opportunistic fungal pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i> in the mouse gastrointestinal tract, we selected strains that not only had lost their main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence program but also protected their new hosts against a variety of systemic infections. This protection was independent of adaptive immunity, arose as early as a single day postpriming, was dependent on increased innate cytokine responses, and was thus reminiscent of “trained immunity.” Because both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>e and its new host gain some advantages from their interaction, this experimental system might allow direct study of the evolutionary forces that govern the emergence of mutualism between a mammal and a fungus.</p>

Ancient steroids establish the Ediacaran fossil <i>Dickinsonia</i> as one of the earliest animals
<p>The enigmatic Ediacara biota (571 million to 541 million years ago) represents the first macroscopic complex organisms in the geological record and may hold the key to our understanding of the origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Ediacaran macrofossils are as “strange as life on another planet” and have evaded taxonomic classification, with interpretations ranging from marine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als or giant single-celled protists to terrestrial lichens. Here, we show that lipid biomarkers extracted from organically preserved Ediacaran macrofossils unambiguously clarify their phylogeny. <i>Dickinsonia</i> and its relatives solely produced cholesteroids, a hallmark of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als.

Systematic discovery of antiphage defense systems in the microbial pangenome
<p>The arms race between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> and phages led to the development of sophisticated antiphage defense systems, including CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification systems. Evidence suggests that known and unknown defense systems are located in “defense islands” in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>ial genomes. Here, we comprehensively characterized the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l defensive arsenal by examining gene families that are clustered next to known defense genes in prokaryotic genomes. Candidate defense systems were systematically engineered and validated in model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> for their antiphage activities.

Phosphoethanolamine cellulose: A naturally produced chemically modified cellulose
<p>Cellulose is a major contributor to the chemical and mechanical properties of plants and assumes structural roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l communities termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>s. We find that <i>Escherichia coli</i> produces chemically modified cellulose that is required for extracellular matrix assembly and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> architecture. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the intact and insoluble material elucidates the zwitterionic phosphoethanolamine modification that had evaded detection by conventional methods. Installation of the phosphoethanolamine group requires BcsG, a proposed phosphoethanolamine transferase, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>-promoting cyclic diguanylate monophosphate input through a BcsE-BcsF-BcsG transmembrane signaling pathway. The <i>bcsEFG</i> operon is present in many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, including <i>Salmonella</i> species, that also produce the modified cellulose. The discovery of phosphoethanolamine cellulose and the genetic and molecular basis for its production offers opportunities to modulate its production in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> and inspires efforts to biosynthetically engineer alternatively modified cellulosic materials.</p>

Genome-wide identification of interferon-sensitive mutations enables influenza vaccine design
<p>In conventional attenuated viral vaccines, immunogenicity is often suboptimal. Here we present a systematic approach for vaccine development that eliminates interferon (IFN)–modulating functions genome-wide while maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication fitness. We applied a quantitative high-throughput genomics system to influenza A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> that simultaneously measured the replication fitness and IFN sensitivity of mutations across the entire genome. By incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, we generated a hyper–interferon-sensitive (HIS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> as a vaccine candidate. HIS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> is highly attenuated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses, elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our approach, which attenuates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> and promotes immune responses concurrently, is broadly applicable for vaccine development against other pathogens.</p>

In Pakistan, surveillance for polio reveals a paradox
<p>Last year polio fighters could smell victory in Pakistan, which many believe will be the last country on Earth to harbor the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>. Cases dropped to an all-time low. Blood tests showed that immunity to the polio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> had never been higher. Surely, there were not enough susceptible children to sustain transmission, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> would burn itself out within a year. Unsettling new findings, however, show it is far from gone. In the most extensive effort in any country to scour the environment for traces of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, polio workers are finding it widely across Pakistan, in places they thought it had disappeared. They are wondering "just what the hell is going on" and how worried they should be, says epidemiologist Chris Maher of the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, who runs polio operations in the eastern Mediterranean region. Does this mean the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> is more entrenched than anyone realized and is poised to resurge? Or is this how a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> behaves in its final days—persisting in the environment but not causing disease until it fades out? </p>

Loss of <i>AvrSr50</i> by somatic exchange in stem rust leads to virulence for <i>Sr50</i> resistance in wheat
<p>Race-specific resistance genes protect the global wheat crop from stem rust disease caused by <i>Puccinia graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pgt</i>) but are often overcome owing to evolution of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ent races of the pathogen. To understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence evolution in <i>Pgt</i>, we identified the protein ligand (AvrSr50) recognized by the Sr50 resistance protein. A spontaneous mutant of <i>Pgt</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ent to <i>Sr50</i> contained a 2.5 mega–base pair loss-of-heterozygosity event. A haustorial secreted protein from this region triggers <i>Sr50</i>-dependent defense responses in planta and interacts directly with the Sr50 protein. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence alleles of <i>AvrSr50</i> have arisen through DNA insertion and sequence divergence, and our data provide molecular evidence that in addition to sexual recombination, somatic exchange can play a role in the emergence of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence traits in <i>Pgt</i>.</p>

Potential role of intratumor bacteria in mediating tumor resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine
<p>Growing evidence suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>es can influence the efficacy of cancer therapies. By studying colon cancer models, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> can metabolize the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine (2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine) into its inactive form, 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyuridine. Metabolism was dependent on the expression of a long isoform of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDD<sub>L</sub>), seen primarily in Gammaproteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>. In a colon cancer mouse model, gemcitabine resistance was induced by intratumor Gammaproteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, dependent on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l CDD<sub>L</sub> expression, and abrogated by cotreatment with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibiot</span></strong>ic ciprofloxacin. Gemcitabine is commonly used to treat pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and we hypothesized that intratumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> might contribute to drug resistance of these tumors. Consistent with this possibility, we found that of the 113 human PDACs that were tested, 86 (76%) were positive for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, mainly Gammaproteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>.</p>

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within communities can interact to organize their behavior. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the behavior of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> communities undergoing metabolic oscillations can become coupled through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. Coupling increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>s resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase oscillations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>s to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>s can thus coordinate their behavior to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

Pyocyanin degradation by a tautomerizing demethylase inhibits <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> biofilms

Although phenazines exist in many forms, the best studied is pyocyanin.

Treatment with PodA disrupts <i>P. aeruginosa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> formation similarly to DNase, suggesting interference with the pyocyanin-dependent release of extracellular DNA into the matrix. PodA-dependent pyocyanin demethylation also restricts established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> aggregate populations experiencing anoxic conditions. Together, these results show that modulating extracellular redox-active metabolites can influence the fitness of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>-forming microorganism.</p>

MAVS-dependent host species range and pathogenicity of human hepatitis A virus

Sucrose Nonfermenting 1-Related Protein Kinase 1 Phosphorylates a Geminivirus Rep Protein to Impair Viral Replication and Infection
<p>Gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are single-stranded DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es that infect a wide variety of plants and cause severe crop losses worldwide. The gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication initiator protein (Rep) binds to the viral replication origin and catalyzes DNA cleavage and ligation to initiate rolling circle replication. In this study, we found that the <i>Tomato golden mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (TGMV) Rep is phosphorylated at serine-97 by sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1), a master regulator of plant energy homeostasis and metabolism. Phosphorylation of Rep or the phosphomimic S97D mutation impaired Rep binding to viral DNA. A TGMV DNA-A replicon containing the Rep S97D mutation replicated less efficiently in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) protoplasts than in wild-type or Rep phosphorylation-deficient replicons. The TGMV Rep-S97D mutant also was less infectious than the wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and was unable to infect tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). Nearly all gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> Rep proteins have a serine residue at the position equivalent to TGMV Rep serine-97. SnRK1 phosphorylated the equivalent serines in the Rep proteins of <i>Tomato mottle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> and <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> and reduced DNA binding, suggesting that SnRK1 plays a key role in combating gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> infection. These results established that SnRK1 phosphorylates Rep and interferes with gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication and infection, underscoring the emerging role for SnRK1 in the host defense response against plant pathogens.</p>

The Ancient Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling System Is a Master Regulator of Energy and Carbon Metabolism in Algae
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e undergo a complete metabolic transformation under stress by arresting cell growth, inducing autophagy and hyper-accumulating biofuel precursors such as triacylglycerols and starch. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this stress-induced transformation are still unclear. Here, we use biochemical, mutational, and “omics” approaches to demonstrate that PI3K signaling mediates the homeostasis of energy molecules and influences carbon metabolism in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e. In <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, the inhibition and knockdown (KD) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>l class III PI3K led to significantly decreased cell growth, altered cell morphology, and higher lipid and starch contents. Lipid profiling of wild-type and PI3K KD lines showed significantly reduced membrane lipid breakdown under nitrogen starvation (−N) in the KD. RNA-seq and network analyses showed that under −N conditions, the KD line carried out lipogenesis rather than lipid hydrolysis by initiating de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, which was supported by tricarboxylic acid cycle down-regulation and via acetyl-CoA synthesis from glycolysis. Remarkably, autophagic responses did not have primacy over inositide signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e, unlike in mammals and vascular plants. The mutant displayed a fundamental shift in intracellular energy flux, analogous to that in tumor cells. The high free fatty acid levels and reduced mitochondrial ATP generation led to decreased cell viability. These results indicate that the PI3K signal transduction pathway is the metabolic gatekeeper restraining biofuel yields, thus maintaining fitness and viability under stress in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e. This study demonstrates the existence of homeostasis between starch and lipid synthesis controlled by lipid signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e and expands our understanding of such processes, with biotechnological and evolutionary implications.</p>

We found that knockdown of <i>NbHIPP26</i> expression inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> long-distance movement but did not affect cell-to-cell movement. Drought and PMTV infection up-regulated <i>NbHIPP26</i> gene expression, and PMTV infection protected plants from drought. In addition, <i>NbHIPP26</i> promoter-reporter fusions revealed vascular tissue-specific expression. Mutational and biochemical analyses indicated that NbHIPP26 subcellular localization at the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata was mediated by lipidation (<i>S</i>-acylation and prenylation), as nonlipidated NbHIPP26 was predominantly in the nucleus. Notably, coexpression of NbHIPP26 with TGB1 resulted in a similar nuclear accumulation of NbHIPP26. TGB1 interacted with the carboxyl-terminal CVVM (prenyl) domain of NbHIPP26, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that the TGB1-HIPP26 complex localized to microtubules and accumulated in the nucleolus, with little signal at the plasma membrane or plasmodesmata. These data support a mechanism where interaction with TGB1 negates or reverses NbHIPP26 lipidation, thus releasing membrane-associated NbHIPP26 and redirecting it via microtubules to the nucleus, thereby activating the drought stress response and facilitating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> long-distance movement.</p>

Fine-Tuning Motile Cilia and Flagella: Evolution of the Dynein Motor Proteins from Plants to Humans at High Resolution
<p>The flagellum is a key innovation linked to eukaryogenesis. It provides motility by regulated cycles of bending and bend propagation, which are thought to be controlled by a complex arrangement of seven distinct dyneins in repeated patterns of outer- (OAD) and inner-arm dynein (IAD) complexes. Electron tomography showed high similarity of this axonemal repeat pattern across ciliates, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, but the diversity of dynein sequences across the eukaryotes has not yet comprehensively been resolved and correlated with structural data. To shed light on the evolution of the axoneme I performed an exhaustive analysis of dyneins using the available sequenced genome data. Evidence from motor domain phylogeny allowed expanding the current set of nine dynein subtypes by eight additional isoforms with, however, restricted taxonomic distributions. I confirmed the presence of the nine dyneins in all eukaryotic super-groups indicating their origin predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor. The comparison of the N-terminal tail domains revealed a most likely axonemal dynein origin of the new classes, a group of chimeric dyneins in plants/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e and Stramenopiles, and the unique domain architecture and origin of the outermost OADs present in green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e and ciliates but not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. The correlation of sequence and structural data suggests the single-headed class-8 and class-9 dyneins to localize to the distal end of the axonemal repeat and the class-7 dyneins filling the region up to the proximal heterodimeric IAD. Tracing dynein gene duplications across the eukaryotes indicated ongoing diversification and fine-tuning of flagellar functions in extant taxa and species.</p>

Reduction of blood oxygen levels enhances postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in Burmese python (<i>Python bivittatus</i>)
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by reversible enlargement of cardiomyocytes and changes in chamber architecture, which increase stroke volume and [Formula] via augmented convective oxygen transport. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to occur in response to repeated elevations of O<sub>2</sub> demand and/or reduced O<sub>2</sub> supply in several species of vertebrate ectotherms, including postprandial Burmese pythons (<i>Python bivittatus</i>). Recent data suggest postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in <i>P. bivittatus</i> is a facultative rather than obligatory response to digestion, though the triggers of this response are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that an O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch stimulates postprandial cardiac enlargement in Burmese pythons. To test this hypothesis, we rendered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als anemic prior to feeding, essentially halving blood oxygen content during the postprandial period. Fed anemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als had heart rates 126% higher than those of fasted controls, which, coupled with a 71% increase in mean arterial pressure, suggests fed anemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als were experiencing significantly elevated cardiac work. We found significant cardiac hypertrophy in fed anemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, which exhibited ventricles 39% larger than those of fasted controls and 28% larger than in fed controls. These findings support our hypothesis that those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with a greater magnitude of O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch exhibit the largest hearts. The ‘low O<sub>2</sub> signal’ stimulating postprandial cardiac hypertrophy is likely mediated by elevated ventricular wall stress associated with postprandial hemodynamics.</p>

Does tantalum exhibit any intrinsic antimicrobial or antibiofilm properties?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tantalum (Ta) trabecular metal components are increasingly used   to reconstruct major bone defects in revision arthroplasty surgery.   It is known that some metals such as silver have anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l properties.   Recent reports have raised the question regarding whether Ta components   are protective against infection in revision surgery. This laboratory   study aimed to establish whether Ta has intrinsic anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l   properties against planktonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, or the ability to inhibit   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Equal-sized pieces of Ta and titanium (Ti) acetabular components   were sterilised and incubated with a low dose inoculum of either <i>Staphylococcus   (S.) aureus</i> or <i>S. epidermidis</i> for 24 hours.

<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal adenocarcinoma and Wnt signaling in a mouse model
<p><i>Cryptosporidium</i> species are apicomplexan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protozoa</span></strong>ns that are found worldwide. These parasites constitute a large risk to human and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al health. They cause self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts and a life-threatening disease in immunocompromised hosts. Interestingly, <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> has been related to digestive carcinogenesis in humans. Consistent with a potential tumorigenic role of this parasite, in an original reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al model of chronic cryptosporidiosis based on dexamethasone-treated or untreated adult SCID mice, we formerly reported that <i>C. parvum</i> (strains of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al and human origin) is able to induce digestive adenocarcinoma even in infections induced with very low inoculum. The aim of this study was to further characterize this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al model and to explore metabolic pathways potentially involved in the development of <i>C. parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal oncogenesis. We searched for alterations in genes or proteins commonly involved in cell cycle, differentiation or cell migration, such as β-catenin, <i>Apc</i>, E-cadherin, <i>Kras</i> and <i>p53</i>. After infection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with <i>C. parvum</i> we demonstrated immunohistochemical abnormal localization of Wnt signaling pathway components and p53. Mutations in the selected loci of studied genes were not found after high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, alterations in the ultrastructure of adherens junctions of the ileo-caecal neoplastic epithelia of <i>C. parvum</i>-infected mice were recorded using transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the Wnt signaling pathway, and particularly the cytoskeleton network, seems to be pivotal for the development of the <i>C. parvum</i>-induced neoplastic process and cell migration of transformed cells. Furthermore, this model is a valuable tool in understanding the host-pathogen interactions associated with the intricate infection process of this parasite, which is able to modulate host cytoskeleton activities and several host-cell biological processes and remains a significant cause of infection worldwide.</p>

Moving in the Anthropocene: Global reductions in terrestrial mammalian movements
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al movement is fundamental for ecosystem functioning and species survival, yet the effects of the anthropogenic footprint on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al movements have not been estimated across species. Using a unique GPS-tracking database of 803 individuals across 57 species, we found that movements of mammals in areas with a comparatively high human footprint were on average one-half to one-third the extent of their movements in areas with a low human footprint. We attribute this reduction to behavioral changes of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als and to the exclusion of species with long-range movements from areas with higher human impact. Global loss of vagility alters a key ecological trait of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als that affects not only population persistence but also ecosystem processes such as predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and disease transmission.</p>

Gut microbes shape response to cancer immunotherapy
<p>This week, two studies offer a raft of evidence from cancer patients suggesting that the gut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>iome—the community of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, and other bugs living in our digestive tracts—helps determine whether tumors shrink when treated with a powerful new type of cancer drug. Patients who took <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibiot</span></strong>ics for routine reasons before or soon after starting a type of immunotherapy known as a PD-1 inhibitor relapsed and died sooner than those who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibiot</span></strong>ic-free. And when mice received fecal transplants from patients who responded to the drugs, they did better on PD-1 blockers than did mice given nonresponder feces. Researchers are now planning a clinical trial to test whether manipulating the gut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>iome could help more cancer patients respond to PD-1 blockers.</p>

Ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the intestine drives T<sub>H</sub>1 cell induction and inflammation
<p>Intestinal colonization by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> of oral origin has been correlated with several negative health outcomes, including inflammatory bowel disease. However, a causal role of oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> ectopically colonizing the intestine remains unclear. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gnotobiot</span></strong>ic techniques, we show that strains of <i>Klebsiella</i> spp. isolated from the salivary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>iota are strong inducers of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) cells when they colonize in the gut. These <i>Klebsiella</i> strains are resistant to multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibiot</span></strong>ics, tend to colonize when the intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microb</span></strong>iota is dysbiotic, and elicit a severe gut inflammation in the context of a genetically susceptible host. Our findings suggest that the oral cavity may serve as a reservoir for potential intestinal pathobionts that can exacerbate intestinal disease.</p>

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally transmitted Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> has been documented in the United States this year, a reflection of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with efforts to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid spread of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population immune. This so-called "herd immunity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of transmission between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a vaccine against Zika, which caused widespread alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain deformities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> while they were pregnant. But with transmission in the region becoming scarce, it does complicate efforts of clinical trials that hope to show lower rates of transmission and disease in vaccinated people. One such trial is underway right now.</p>

Dengue may bring out the worst in Zika
<p>Mice infused against either dengue or West Nile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> became far more susceptible to disease and death from Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, a new study published online in <i>Science</i> shows. The mice, engineered to cripple an immune gene that normally helps suppress Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, of course may not represent what happens in humans. But antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known phenomenon with dengue, which has four “serotypes” that infect humans. Infection with one dengue serotype typically causes little harm, but the antibodies produced against it can set a people up for severe and even deadly disease if they subsequently become infected by a different serotype. Dengue, West Nile, and Zika are all from the flavi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> family and the researchers warn that a vaccine against one could put a person at risk for ADE from a relative. Dengue is closet to Zika, and indeed the mouse experiment showed that dengue antibodies led to the most severe Zika disease. ADE also led to high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in mouse testes and spinal cords, which may help explain sexual transmission of Zika in humans and central nervous system diseases like microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barré Syndrome in adults.</p>

Antibiotic tolerance facilitates the evolution of resistance
<p>Controlled experimental evolution during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibiot</span></strong>ic treatment can help to explain the processes leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibiot</span></strong>ic resistance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>. Recently, intermittent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibiot</span></strong>ic exposures have been shown to lead rapidly to the evolution of tolerance—that is, the ability to survive under treatment without developing resistance. However, whether tolerance delays or promotes the eventual emergence of resistance is unclear. Here we used in vitro evolution experiments to explore this question. We found that in all cases, tolerance preceded resistance. A mathematical population-genetics model showed how tolerance boosts the chances for resistance mutations to spread in the population. Thus, tolerance mutations pave the way for the rapid subsequent evolution of resistance. Preventing the evolution of tolerance may offer a new strategy for delaying the emergence of resistance.</p>

Sick birds don't fly…or do they?
<p>In 2014, a new, highly pathogenic avian influenza <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (HPAIV) called H5N8 caused outbreaks in poultry in East and Southeast Asia and spread across the Northern Hemisphere to Europe and North America. In the United States alone, H5N8 outbreaks resulted in the destruction of more than 48 million poultry birds (<i>1</i>). International live-poultry trade and wild-bird migration have both been implicated in the intercontinental movement of H5N8 and other HPAIVs. H5N8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es have been found in wild birds (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>), but strong links between poultry outbreaks and live-poultry trade or wild-bird migration have been elusive.

Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p>Auxin controls body plan patterning in land plants and has been proposed to play a similar role in the development of brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with land plants. The mechanism of auxin action in brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model system to show that auxin plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e. Indole-3-acetic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally develop a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meristem from the other, addition of exogenous auxins to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo developed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when variable extrinsic informational cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an inhibitor of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of transporters in land plants, affected rhizoid formation by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of auxin genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and transport genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) transporters from land plants have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>. Together with reports on auxin function in basal lineages of green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e, these results suggest that auxin function predates the divergence between the green and brown lineage and the transition toward land plants.</p>

Cylindrical Inclusion Protein of Turnip Mosaic Virus Serves as a Docking Point for the Intercellular Movement of Viral Replication Vesicles
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es move from the initially infected cell to adjacent cells through plasmodesmata (PDs). To do so, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es encode dedicated protein(s) that facilitate this process. How viral proteins act together to support the intercellular movement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es is poorly defined. Here, by using an infection-free intercellular vesicle movement assay, we investigate the action of CI (cylindrical inclusion) and P3N-PIPO (amino-terminal half of P3 fused to Pretty Interesting Potyviridae open reading frame), the two PD-localized potyviral proteins encoded by <i>Turnip mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (TuMV), in the intercellular movement of the viral replication vesicles. We provide evidence that CI and P3N-PIPO are sufficient to support the PD targeting and intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles induced by 6K2, a viral protein responsible for the generation of replication vesicles. 6K2 interacts with CI but not P3N-PIPO. When this interaction is impaired, the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles is inhibited. Furthermore, in transmission electron microscopy, vesicular structures are observed in connection with the cylindrical inclusion bodies at structurally modified PDs in cells coexpressing 6K2, CI, and P3N-PIPO. CI is directed to PDs through its interaction with P3N-PIPO. We hypothesize that CI serves as a docking point for PD targeting and the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles. This work contributes to a better understanding of the roles of different viral proteins in coordinating the intercellular movement of viral replication vesicles.</p>

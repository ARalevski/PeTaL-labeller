Transcription Factor OsTGA10 Is a Target of the MADS Protein OsMADS8 and Is Required for Tapetum Development
<p>This study aimed at elucidating regulatory components behind floral organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity determination and tissue development. It remains unclear how organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity proteins facilitate development of organ primordia into tissues with a determined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity, even though it has long been accepted that floral organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity is genetically determined by interaction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity genes according to the ABC model. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing technique, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ified <i>OsTGA10</i>, encoding a bZIP transcription factor, as a target of the MADS box protein OsMADS8, which is annotated as an E-class organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity protein. We characterized the function of OsTGA10 using genetic and molecular analyses. <i>OsTGA10</i> was preferentially expressed during stamen development, and mutation of <i>OsTGA10</i> resulted in male sterility. OsTGA10 was required for tapetum development and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes. In addition, in <i>ostga10</i> stamens, the hallmark cell wall thickening of the endothecium was defective. Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity determination and tapetum development in rice stamen development, between tapetum development and microspore development, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum development. Furthermore, the defective endothecium in <i>ostga10</i> implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum development.</p>

<i>MtNODULE ROOT1</i> and <i>MtNODULE ROOT2</i> Are Essential for Indeterminate Nodule Identity
<p>Symbiotic interactions between legume plants and rhizobia result in the formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules, but the molecular actors and the mechanisms allowing for the maintenance of nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity are poorly understood. <i>Medicago truncatula NODULE ROOT1</i> (<i>MtNOOT1</i>), <i>Pisum sativum COCHLEATA1</i> (<i>PsCOCH1</i>), and <i>Lotus japonicus NOOT-BOP-COCH-LIKE1</i> (<i>LjNBCL1</i>) are orthologs of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtBLADE-ON-PETIOLE1/2</i> and are members of the <i>NBCL</i> gene family, which has conserved roles in plant development and is essential for indeterminate and determinate nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity in legumes. The loss of function of <i>MtNOOT1</i>, <i>PsCOCH1</i>, and <i>LjNBCL1</i> triggers a partial loss of nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity characterized by the development of ectopic roots arising from nodule vascular meristems. Here, we report the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ification and characterization of a second gene involved in regulating indeterminate nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity in <i>M. truncatula</i>, <i>MtNOOT2</i>. <i>MtNOOT2</i> is the paralog of <i>MtNOOT1</i> and belongs to a second legume-specific <i>NBCL</i> subclade, the <i>NBCL2</i> clade. <i>MtNOOT2</i> expression was induced during early nodule formation, and it was expressed primarily in the nodule central meristem. <i>Mtnoot2</i> mutants did not present any particular symbiotic phenotype; however, the loss of function of both <i>MtNOOT1</i> and <i>MtNOOT2</i> resulted in the complete loss of nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity and was accompanied by drastic changes in the expression of symbiotic, defense, and root apical meristem marker genes. <i>Mtnoot1 noot2</i> double mutants developed only nonfixing root-like structures that were no longer able to host symbiotic rhizobia. This study provides original insights into the molecular basis underlying nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity in legumes forming indeterminate nodules.</p>

Encoding vocal culture
<p>How does an inexperienced young animal acquire proper communication skills that will serve it well as an adult in a complex social environment? Juvenile songbirds acquire their vocal repertoire by imitating songs from adults. But song imitation per se is not the ultimate goal of their vocal development (<i>1</i>). Birdsong may carry information about species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity, group <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity (local culture), individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity, and—perhaps most important—about a bird's qualities as a potential mate (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). There is some tension between these developmental goals: Because birds can imitate songs very accurately, local song convergence could compromise individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity. Similarly, the accumulation of geographical drifts in song structure could potentially compromise the species-specific “signature” of the song. On pages 1278 and 1282 of this issue, Gadagkar <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) and Araki <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>), respectively, discover neuronal coding of singing performance error and of species song <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity. Together, their findings reveal an elegant natural solution that alleviates the tension between cultural transmission and retaining a species-specific “signature” in songs over generations.</p>

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor
<p>The anomalous metallic state in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates is masked by superconductivity near a quantum critical point. Applying high magnetic fields to suppress superconductivity has enabled detailed studies of the normal state, yet the direct effect of strong magnetic fields on the metallic state is poorly understood. We report the high-field magnetoresistance of thin-film La<sub>2–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>Sr<i><sub>x</sub></i>CuO<sub>4</sub> cuprate in the vicinity of the critical doping, 0.161 ≤ <i>p</i> ≤ 0.190. We find that the metallic state exposed by suppressing superconductivity is characterized by magnetoresistance that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> in magnetic fields up to 80 tesla. The magnitude of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong>-in-field resistivity mirrors the magnitude and doping evolution of the well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong>-in-temperature resistivity that has been associated with quantum criticality in high-temperature superconductors.</p>

Synapse-specific representation of the identity of overlapping memory engrams
<p>Memories are integrated into interconnected networks; nevertheless, each memory has its own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity. How the brain defines specific memory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity out of intermingled memories stored in a shared cell ensemble has remained elusive. We found that after complete retrograde amnesia of auditory fear conditioning in mice, optogenetic stimulation of the auditory inputs to the lateral amygdala failed to induce memory recall, implying that the memory engram no longer existed in that circuit. Complete amnesia of a given fear memory did not affect another linked fear memory encoded in the shared ensemble. Optogenetic potentiation or depotentiation of the plasticity at synapses specific to one memory affected the recall of only that memory. Thus, the sharing of engram cells underlies the linkage between memories, whereas synapse-specific plasticity guarantees the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity and storage of individual memories.</p>

Rotary and linear molecular motors driven by pulses of a chemical fuel
<p>Many biomolecular motors catalyze the hydrolysis of chemical fuels, such as adenosine triphosphate, and use the energy released to direct motion through information ratchet mechanisms. Here we describe chemically-driven artificial rotary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> molecular motors that operate through a fundamentally different type of mechanism. The directional rotation of [2]- and [3]catenane rotary molecular motors and the transport of substrates away from equilibrium by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> molecular pump are induced by acid-base oscillations. The changes simultaneously switch the binding site affinities and the labilities of barriers on the track, creating an energy ratchet. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> and rotary molecular motors are driven by aliquots of a chemical fuel, trichloroacetic acid. A single fuel pulse generates 360° unidirectional rotation of up to 87% of crown ethers in a [2]catenane rotary motor.</p>

Ultrafast Approximation for Phylogenetic Bootstrap
<p>Nonparametric bootstrap has been a widely used tool in phylogenetic analysis to assess the clade support of phylogenetic trees. However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ation approach (UFBoot) to compute the support of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch support values to automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate trees. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66–33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32–41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the support values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap support. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at <ext-link>http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree</ext-link>) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.</p>

The Repertoires of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Eukaryotic Genomes
<p>Reversible protein ubiquitination regulates virtually all known cellular activities. Here, we present a quantitatively evaluated and broadly applicable method to predict eukaryotic ubiquitinating enzymes (UBE) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) and its application to 50 distinct genomes belonging to four of the five major phylogenetic supergroups of eukaryotes: unikonts (including metazoans, fungi, choanozoa, and amoebozoa), excavates, chromalveolates, and plants. Our method relies on a collection of profile hidden Markov models, and we demonstrate its superior performance (coverage and classification accuracy >99%) by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately 25% and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately 35% additional UBE and DUB genes in yeast and human, which had not been reported before. In yeast, we predict 85 UBE and 24 DUB genes, for 814 UBE and 107 DUB genes in the human genome. Most UBE and DUB families are present in all eukaryotic lineages, with plants and animals harboring massively enlarged repertoires of ubiquitin ligases. Unicellular organisms, on the other hand, typically harbor less than 300 UBEs and less than 40 DUBs per genome. Ninety-one UBE/DUB genes are orthologous across all four eukaryotic supergroups, and these likely represent a primordial core of enzymes of the ubiquitination system probably dating back to the first eukaryotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately 2 billion years ago. Our genome-wide predictions are available through the Database of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes (<ext-link>www.DUDE-db.org</ext-link>), where users can also perform advanced sequence and phylogenetic analyses and submit their own predictions.</p>

Systematic Biology
Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead
<p>In phylogenetic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral gene transfer, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a gene was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene transfers involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the evolution of genes along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near-universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of transfer events (28%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately 6% of transfers trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

Recurrent cortical circuits implement concentration-invariant odor coding
<p>Animals rely on olfaction to find food, attract mates, and avoid predators. To support these behaviors, they must be able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ify odors across different odorant concentrations. The neural circuit operations that implement this concentration invariance remain unclear. We found that despite concentration-dependence in the olfactory bulb (OB), representations of odor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity were preserved downstream, in the piriform cortex (PCx). The OB cells responding earliest after inhalation drove robust responses in sparse subsets of PCx neurons. Recurrent collateral connections broadcast their activation across the PCx, recruiting global feedback inhibition that rapidly truncated and suppressed cortical activity for the remainder of the sniff, discounting the impact of slower, concentration-dependent OB inputs. Eliminating recurrent collateral output amplified PCx odor responses rendered the cortex steeply concentration-dependent and abolished concentration-invariant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity decoding.</p>

Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control
<p>Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble a high density of the transcriptional apparatus to drive robust expression of genes with prominent roles in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity. Here we demonstrate that the SE-enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid-like condensates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb condensates. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-separated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts. These results support the idea that coactivators form phase-separated condensates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity genes.</p>

Entanglement between two spatially separated atomic modes
<p>Modern quantum technologies in the fields of quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology require the creation and control of large ensembles of entangled particles.

The entanglement generation relies on the fundamental particle-exchange symmetry in ensembles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ical particles, which lacks the standard notion of entanglement between clearly definable subsystems. Here, we present the generation of entanglement between two spatially separated clouds by splitting an ensemble of ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ical particles prepared in a twin Fock state. Because the clouds can be addressed individually, our experiments open a path to exploit the available entangled states of indistinguishable particles for quantum information applications.</p>

Chameleon-like elastomers with molecularly encoded strain-adaptive stiffening and coloration

Microphase separation of the architecturally distinct blocks results in physically cross-linked networks that display vibrant color, extreme softness, and intense strain stiffening on par with that of skin tissue. Each of these functional properties is regulated by the structure of one macromolecule, without the need for chemical cross-linking or additives. These materials remain stable under conditions characteristic of internal bodily environments and under ambient conditions, neither swelling in bodily fluids nor drying when exposed to air.</p>

Aging and neurodegeneration are associated with increased mutations in single human neurons

Pcdhαc2 is required for axonal tiling and assembly of serotonergic circuitries in mice
<p>Serotonergic neurons project their axons pervasively throughout the brain and innervate various target fields in a space-filling manner, leading to tiled arrangements of their axon terminals to allow optimal allocation of serotonin among target neurons. Here we show that conditional deletion of the mouse protocadherin α (<i>Pcdh</i>α) gene cluster in serotonergic neurons disrupts local axonal tiling and global assembly of serotonergic circuitries and results in depression-like behaviors. Genetic dissection and expression profiling revealed that this role is specifically mediated by Pcdhαc2, which is the only Pcdhα isoform expressed in serotonergic neurons. We conclude that, in contrast to neurite self-avoidance, which requires single-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity mediated by Pcdh diversity, a single cell-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity mediated by the common C-type Pcdh isoform is required for axonal tiling and assembly of serotonergic circuitries.</p>

Experimental measurement of binding energy, selectivity, and allostery using fluctuation theorems
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic bulk measurements of binding reactions rely on the validity of the law of mass action and the assumption of a dilute solution. Yet, important biological systems such as allosteric ligand-receptor binding, macromolecular crowding, or misfolded molecules may not follow these assumptions and may require a particular reaction model. Here we introduce a fluctuation theorem for ligand binding and an experimental approach using single-molecule force spectroscopy to determine binding energies, selectivity, and allostery of nucleic acids and peptides in a model-independent fashion. A similar approach could be used for proteins. This work extends the use of fluctuation theorems beyond unimolecular folding reactions, bridging the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ics of small systems and the basic laws of chemical equilibrium.</p>

Observed Arctic sea-ice loss directly follows anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission
<p>Arctic sea ice is retreating rapidly, raising prospects of a future ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer.

The observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> relationship implies a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 square meters of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emission. On the basis of this sensitivity, Arctic sea ice will be lost throughout September for an additional 1000 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Most models show a lower sensitivity, which is possibly linked to an underestimation of the modeled increase in incoming longwave radiation and of the modeled transient climate response.</p>

Characterization and Cloning of Grape Circular RNAs Identified the Cold Resistance-Related <i>Vv-circATS1</i>
<p>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely distributed and play essential roles in a series of developmental processes, although none have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ified or characterized in grapevines (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>). In this study, we characterized the function of grape circRNA and uncovered thousands of putative back-splicing sites by global transcriptome analysis. Our results indicated that several reported circRNA prediction algorithms should be used simultaneously to obtain comprehensive and reliable circRNA predictions in plants. Furthermore, the length of introns flanking grape circRNAs was closely related to exon circularization. Although the longer introns flanking grape circRNAs appeared to circularize more efficiently, a 20- to 50-nt region seemed large enough to drive grape circRNA biogenesis. In addition, the endogenous introns flanking circularized exon(s) in conjunction with reverse complementary sequences could support the accurate and efficient circularization of various exons in grape, which constitutes a new tool for exploring the functional consequences caused by circRNA expression. Finally, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ified 475 differentially expressed circRNAs in grape leaves under cold stress. Overexpression of <i>Vv-circATS1</i>, a circRNA derived from <i>glycerol-3-P acyltransferase</i>, improved cold tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), while the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> RNA derived from the same sequence cannot. These results indicate the functional difference between circRNA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> RNA, and provide new insight into plant abiotic stress resistance.</p>

Proteome-Wide Analysis of Cysteine Reactivity during Effector-Triggered Immunity
<p>A surge in the accumulation of oxidants generates shifts in the cellular redox potential during early stages of plant infection with pathogens and activation of effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The redoxome, defined as the proteome-wide oxidative modifications of proteins caused by oxidants, has a well-known impact on stress responses in metazoans. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity of proteins and the residues sensitive to oxidation during the plant immune response remain largely unknown. Previous studies of the thimet oligopeptidases TOP1 and TOP2 placed them in the salicylic acid dependent branch of ETI, with a current model wherein TOPs sustain interconnected organellar and cytosolic pathways that modulate the oxidative burst and development of cell death. Herein, we characterized the ETI redoxomes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) wild-type Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> mutant plants using a differential alkylation-based enrichment technique coupled with label-free mass spectrometry-based quantification. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ified cysteines sensitive to oxidation in a wide range of protein families at multiple time points after pathogen infection. Differences were detected between Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> redoxomes regarding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity and number of oxidized cysteines, and the amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in protein oxidation. Our results support a determining role for TOPs in maintaining the proper level and dynamics of proteome oxidation during ETI. This study significantly expands the repertoire of oxidation-sensitive plant proteins and can guide future mechanistic studies.</p>

Development of Decreased-Gluten Wheat Enabled by Determination of the Genetic Basis of <i>lys3a</i> Barley
<p>Celiac disease is the most common food-induced enteropathy in humans, with a prevalence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately 1% worldwide. It is induced by digestion-resistant, proline- and glutamine-rich seed storage proteins, collectively referred to as gluten, found in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). Related prolamins are present in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) and rye (<i>Secale cereale</i>). The incidence of both celiac disease and a related condition called nonceliac gluten sensitivity is increasing. This has prompted efforts to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ify methods of lowering gluten in wheat, one of the most important cereal crops. Here, we used bulked segregant RNA sequencing and map-based cloning to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ify the genetic lesion underlying a recessive, low-prolamin mutation (<i>lys3a</i>) in diploid barley. We confirmed the mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity by complementing the <i>lys3a</i> mutant with a transgenic copy of the wild-type barley gene and then used targeting-induced local lesions in genomes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ify induced single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the three homeologs of the corresponding wheat gene. Combining inactivating mutations in the three subgenomes of hexaploid bread wheat in a single wheat line lowered gliadin and low-molecular-weight glutenin accumulation by 50% to 60% and increased free and protein-bound lysine by 33%.</p>

The Role of Auxin in the Pattern Formation of the Asteraceae Flower Head (Capitulum)
<p>Nature often creates complex structures by rearranging pre-existing units. One such example is the flower head (capitulum) in daisies, where a group of flowers (florets) and phyllaries (modified bracts) are arranged to superficially mimic a single flower. The capitulum is a key taxonomical innovation that defines the daisy family (Asteraceae), the largest flowering plant group. However, patterning mechanisms underlying its structure remain elusive. Here, we show that auxin, a plant hormone, provides a developmental patterning cue for the capitulum. During capitulum development, a temporal auxin gradient occurs, regulating the successive and centripetal formation of distinct florets and phyllaries. Disruption of the endogenous auxin gradient led to homeotic conversions of florets and phyllaries in the capitulum. Furthermore, auxin regulates floral meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity genes, such as <i>Matricaria inodora RAY2</i> and <i>M</i>. <i>inodora LEAFY</i>, which determine floret and phyllary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity. This study reveals the mechanism of capitulum patterning and highlights how common developmental tools, such as hormone gradients, have independently evolved in plants and animals.</p>

The Mitochondrial Endonuclease M20 Participates in the Down-Regulation of Mitochondrial DNA in Pollen Cells
<p>Maintaining the appropriate number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules is crucial for supporting mitochondrial metabolism and function in both plant and animal cells. For example, a substantial decrease in mtDNA levels occurs as a key part of pollen development. The molecular mechanisms regulating mtDNA copy number are largely unclear, particularly with regard to those that reduce mtDNA levels. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ified and purified a 20-kD endonuclease, M20, from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen mitochondria. We found M20 to be an His-Asn-His/Asn (H-N-H/N) nuclease that degrades <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> and circular DNA in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtM20, which shared high sequence similarity with maize M20, localized to the mitochondria, had a similar H-N-H/N structure, and degraded both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> and circular DNA. <i>AtM20</i> transcript levels increased during pollen development, in parallel with a rapid reduction in mtDNA. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome-editing techniques were used to generate knockout lines of <i>AtM20</i> (<i>atm20</i>), which exhibited a significant delay in the reduction in mtDNA levels in pollen vegetative cells but normal mtDNA levels in somatic cells. The delayed reduction in pollen mtDNA levels was rescued by the transgenic expression of <i>AtM20</i> in <i>atm20</i> plants. This study thus uncovers an endonucleolytic DNase in plant mitochondria and its crucial role in reducing mtDNA levels, pointing to the complex mechanism regulating mtDNA levels in plants.</p>

<i>OsMADS6</i> Controls Flower Development by Activating Rice <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE1</i>
<p><i>OsMADS6</i>, an ancient <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE6</i> (<i>AGL6</i>)-like gene, has essential functions in specifying floral organ and meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, how <i>AGL6</i> genes control flower development remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that OsMADS6 directly targets <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1</i> (<i>OsFDML1</i>), a rice homolog of the <i>SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3</i>-like gene <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION 1</i> (<i>FDM1</i>) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Arabidopsis <i>FDM1</i> is involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation and <i>OsFDML1</i> regulates flower development. The expression of <i>OsFDML1</i> overlaps with that of <i>OsMADS6</i> in the palea primordia and the ovule, and OsMADS6 directly promotes <i>OsFDML1</i> expression through binding to regions containing putative CArG motifs within the <i>OsFDML1</i> promoter during rice spikelet development. Consistent with the phenotypes of <i>osmads6</i> mutants, the <i>osfdml1</i> mutants showed floral defects, including altered palea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity with lemma-like shape containing no marginal region of palea, increased numbers of stigmas and fused carpels, and meristem indeterminacy. Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing <i>OsFDML1</i> displayed floral defects, such as abnormal paleae. Phylogenetic analysis showed that <i>OsFDML1</i> homologs exist only in terrestrial plants. In addition, protein-protein interaction assays showed that OsFDML1 interacts with its close paralog OsFDML2, similar to the activity of OsFDML1 homologs in Arabidopsis. These results provide insight into how the ancient <i>AGL6</i> gene regulates floral development.</p>

Loss of LOFSEP Transcription Factor Function Converts Spikelet to Leaf-Like Structures in Rice
<p><i>SEPALLATA</i> (<i>SEP</i>)-like genes, which encode a subfamily of MADS-box transcription factors, are essential for specifying floral organ and meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity in angiosperms. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) has five <i>SEP</i>-like genes with partial redundancy and overlapping expression domains, yet their functions and evolutionary conservation are only partially known. Here, we describe the biological role of one of the <i>SEP</i> genes of rice, <i>OsMADS5</i>, in redundantly controlling spikelet morphogenesis. <i>OsMADS5</i> belongs to the conserved <i>LOFSEP</i> subgroup along with <i>OsMADS1</i> and <i>OsMADS34</i>. <i>OsMADS5</i> was expressed strongly across a broad range of reproductive stages and tissues. No obvious phenotype was observed in the <i>osmads5</i> single mutants when compared with the wild type, which was largely due to the functional redundancy among the three <i>LOFSEP</i> genes. Genetic and molecular analyses demonstrated that <i>OsMADS1</i>, <i>OsMADS5</i>, and <i>OsMADS34</i> together regulate floral meristem determinacy and specify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ities of spikelet organs by positively regulating the other MADS-box floral homeotic genes. Experiments conducted in yeast also suggested that OsMADS1, OsMADS5, and OsMADS34 form protein-protein interactions with other MADS-box floral homeotic members, which seems to be a typical, conserved feature of plant SEP proteins.</p>

Cell-Fate Specification in Arabidopsis Roots Requires Coordinative Action of Lineage Instruction and Positional Reprogramming
<p>Tissue organization and pattern formation within a multicellular organism rely on coordinated cell division and cell-fate determination. In animals, cell fates are mainly determined by a cell lineage-dependent mechanism, whereas in plants, positional information is thought to be the primary determinant of cell fates. However, our understanding of cell-fate regulation in plants mostly relies on the histological and anatomical studies on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, which contain a single layer of each cell type in nonvascular tissues. Here, we investigate the dynamic cell-fate acquisition in modified Arabidopsis roots with additional cell layers that are artificially generated by the misexpression of <i>SHORT-ROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>). We found that cell-fate determination in Arabidopsis roots is a dimorphic cascade with lineage inheritance dominant in the early stage of pattern formation. The inherited cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity can subsequently be removed or modified by positional information. The instruction of cell-fate conversion is not a fast readout during root development. The final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity of a cell type is determined by the synergistic contribution from multiple layers of regulation, including symplastic communication across tissues. Our findings underline the collaborative inputs during cell-fate instruction.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

Cis-Regulatory Evolution of Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1), a Terminal Selector Gene for Decidual Stromal Cell Identity
<p>Studies in human and mouse have shown that decidual stromal cells (DSC), which develop in the innermost lining of uterus, mediate placentation by regulating maternal immune response against the fetus and the extent of fetal invasion. Investigating when and how DSC evolved is thus a key step to reconstructing the evolutionary history of mammalian pregnancy. We present molecular evidence placing the origin of DSC in the stem lineage of eutherians (extant placental mammals). The transcription factor forkhead box O1 (<i>FOXO1</i>) is a part of the core regulatory transcription factor complex (CoRC) that establishes the cell type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity of DSC. Decidualization, the process through which DSC differentiate from endometrial stromal fibroblasts, requires transcriptional upregulation of <i>FOXO1</i>. Contrary to other examples in mammals where gene recruitment is caused by the origin of an alternative promoter, FOXO1 is transcribed from the same promoter in DSC as in endometrial stromal fibroblasts. Comparing the activities of <i>FOXO1</i> promoters from human, mouse, manatee (Afrotheria), and opossum (marsupial) revealed that <i>FOXO1</i> promoter evolved responsiveness to decidualization signals in the stem lineage of eutherians. This eutherian vs. marsupial pattern of promoter activity was not observed in some other cell types expressing <i>FOXO1</i>, suggesting that this cis-regulatory evolution occurred specifically in the context of the origin of DSC. Sequence comparison revealed eutherian-specifically conserved nucleotides that contribute to the eutherian promoter activity. We conclude that the cis-regulatory activity of a terminal selector gene for decidual stromal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity evolved in the stem lineage of eutherians supporting a model where decidual cells are a eutherian innovation.</p>

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-genome sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-genome sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage genome sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque genome, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE genomes. Some genes carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease genes. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related genes carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. Genome-wide genetic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM genome, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the genome) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on genome-wide data.</p>

The Evolution of Human Cells in Terms of Protein Innovation
<p>Humans are composed of hundreds of cell types. As the genomic DNA of each somatic cell is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ical, cell type is determined by what is expressed and when. Until recently, little has been reported about the determinants of human cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity, particularly from the joint perspective of gene evolution and expression. Here, we chart the evolutionary past of all documented human cell types via the collective histories of proteins, the principal product of gene expression. FANTOM5 data provide cell-type–specific digital expression of human protein-coding genes and the SUPERFAMILY resource is used to provide protein domain annotation. The evolutionary epoch in which each protein was created is inferred by comparison with domain annotation of all other completely sequenced genomes. Studying the distribution across epochs of genes expressed in each cell type reveals insights into human cellular evolution in terms of protein innovation. For each cell type, its history of protein innovation is charted based on the genes it expresses. Combining the histories of all cell types enables us to create a timeline of cell evolution. This timeline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ifies the possibility that our common ancestor Coelomata (cavity-forming animals) provided the innovation required for the innate immune system, whereas cells which now form the brain of human have followed a trajectory of continually accumulating novel proteins since Opisthokonta (boundary of animals and fungi). We conclude that exaptation of existing domain architectures into new contexts is the dominant source of cell-type–specific domain architectures.</p>

FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for Inferring Selection
<p>Model-based analyses of natural selection often categorize sites into a relatively small number of site classes. Forcing each site to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of selection parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the distribution of selection parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying selection to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different levels of positive or purifying selection—an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (<ext-link>http://www.hyphy.org</ext-link>), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (<ext-link>http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>).</p>

The T/I ratio and the Cobb angle were calculated at several time   points during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 30 months (6 to 57).

Increase in Endovascular Therapy in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke After the Publication of Pivotal Trials
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Beginning in December 2014, a series of pivotal trials showed that endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was highly effective, prompting calls to reorganize stroke systems of care. However, there are few data on how these trials influenced the frequency of EVT in clinical practice. We used data from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke program to determine how the frequency of EVT changed in US practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed prospectively collected data from a cohort of 2 437 975 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to 2222 participating hospitals between April 2003 and the third quarter of 2016. Weighted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> regression with 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> splines and a knot at January 2015 was used to compare the slope of the change in EVT use before and after the pivotal trials were published. Potentially eligible patients were defined as last known well to arrival time ≤4.5 hours and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The frequency of EVT use was slowly increasing before January 2015 but then sharply accelerated thereafter. In the third quarter 2016, EVT was provided to 3.3% of all patients with ischemic stroke at all hospitals, representing 15.1% of all patients who were potentially eligible for EVT based on stroke duration and severity. At EVT-capable hospitals, 7.5% of all patients with ischemic stroke were treated in the third quarter of 2016, including 27.3% of the potentially eligible patients. From 2013 to 2016, case volumes nearly doubled at EVT-capable hospitals. Mean case volume per EVT-capable hospital was 37.6 per year in the last 4 quarters. EVT case volumes increased in nearly all US states from 2014 to the last 4 quarters, but with persistent geographic variation unexplained by differences in potential patient eligibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>EVT use is increasing rapidly; however, there are still opportunities to treat more patients. Reorganizing stroke systems to route patients to adequately resourced EVT-capable hospitals might increase treatment of eligible patients, improve outcomes, and reduce disparities.</p></sec>

Age and Outcomes of Primary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The DANISH study (Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs [Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators] in Patients With Non-Ischemic Systolic Heart Failure on Mortality) did not demonstrate an overall effect on all-cause mortality with ICD implantation. However, the prespecified subgroup analysis suggested a possible age-dependent association between ICD implantation and mortality with survival benefit seen only in the youngest patients. The nature of this relationship between age and outcome of a primary prevention ICD in patients with nonischemic systolic heart failure warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All 1116 patients from the DANISH study were included in this prespecified subgroup analysis. We assessed the relationship between ICD implantation and mortality by age, and an optimal age cutoff was estimated nonparametrically with selection impact curves. Modes of death were divided into sudden cardiac death and nonsudden death and compared between patients younger and older than this age cutoff with the use of χ<sup>2</sup> analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Median age of the study population was 63 years (range, 21–84 years). There was a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong>ly decreasing relationship between ICD and mortality with age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003–1.06; <i>P</i>=0.03). An optimal age cutoff for ICD implantation was present at ≤70 years. There was an association between reduced all-cause mortality and ICD in patients ≤70 years of age (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.96; <i>P</i>=0.03) but not in patients >70 years of age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.68–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.84). For patients ≤70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.5) and nonsudden death rate was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1–3.5) events per 100 patient-years, whereas for patients >70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8–3.2) and nonsudden death rate was 5.4 (95% CI, 3.7–7.8) events per 100 patient-years. This difference in modes of death between the 2 age groups was statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with systolic heart failure not caused by ischemic heart disease, the association between the ICD and survival decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong>ly with increasing age. In this study population, an age cutoff for ICD implantation at ≤70 years yielded the highest survival for the population as a whole.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

The tissue-specific transcriptomic landscape of the mid-gestational mouse embryo
<p>Differential gene expression is a prerequisite for the formation of multiple cell types from the fertilized egg during embryogenesis. Understanding the gene regulatory networks controlling cellular differentiation requires the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ification of crucial differentially expressed control genes and, ideally, the determination of the complete transcriptomes of each individual cell type. Here, we have analyzed the transcriptomes of six major tissues dissected from mid-gestational (TS12) mouse embryos. Approximately one billion reads derived by RNA-seq analysis provided extended transcript lengths, novel first exons and alternative transcripts of known genes. We have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ified 1375 genes showing tissue-specific expression, providing gene signatures for each of the six tissues. In addition, we have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ified 1403 novel putative long noncoding RNA gene loci, 439 of which show differential expression. Our analysis provides the first complete transcriptome data for the mouse embryo. It offers a rich data source for the analysis of individual genes and gene regulatory networks controlling mid-gestational development.</p>

Fate map of the chicken otic placode
<p>The inner ear is an intricate three-dimensional sensory organ that arises from a flat, thickened portion of the ectoderm termed the otic placode. There is evidence that the ontogenetic steps involved in the progressive specification of the highly specialized inner ear of vertebrates involve the concerted actions of diverse patterning signals that originate from nearby tissues, providing positional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ity and instructive context. The topology of the prospective inner ear portions at placode stages when such patterning begins has remained largely unknown. The chick-quail model was used to perform a comprehensive fate mapping study of the chick otic placode, shedding light on the precise topological position of each presumptive inner ear component relative to the dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes of the otic placode and, implicitly, to the possible sources of inducing signals. The findings reveal the existence of three dorsoventrally arranged anteroposterior domains from which the endolymphatic system, the maculae and basilar papilla, and the cristae develop. This study provides new bases for the interpretation of earlier and future descriptive and experimental studies that aim to understand the molecular genetic mechanisms involved in otic placode patterning.</p>

A dynamic cell adhesion surface regulates tissue architecture in growth plate cartilage
<p>The architecture and morphogenetic properties of tissues are founded in the tissue-specific regulation of cell behaviors. In endochondral bones, the growth plate cartilage promotes bone elongation via regulated chondrocyte maturation within an ordered, three-dimensional cell array. A key event in the process that generates this cell array is the transformation of disordered resting chondrocytes into clonal columns of discoid proliferative cells aligned with the primary growth vector. Previous analysis showed that column-forming chondrocytes display planar cell divisions, and the resulting daughter cells rearrange by ∼90° to align with the lengthening column. However, these previous studies provided limited information about the mechanisms underlying this dynamic process. Here we present new mechanistic insights generated by application of a novel time-lapse confocal microscopy method along with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We show that, during cell division, daughter chondrocytes establish a cell-cell adhesion surface enriched in cadherins and β-catenin. Rearrangement into columns occurs concomitant with expansion of this adhesion surface in a process more similar to cell spreading than to migration. Column formation requires cell-cell adhesion, as reducing cadherin binding via chelation of extracellular calcium inhibits chondrocyte rearrangement. Importantly, physical indicators of cell polarity, such as cell body alignment, are not prerequisites for oriented cell behavior. Our results support a model in which regulation of adhesive surface dynamics and cortical tension by extrinsic signaling modifies the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic landscape to promote organization of daughter cells in the context of the three-dimensional growth plate tissue.</p>

Dual role for Hox genes and Hox co-factors in conferring leg motoneuron survival and identity in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Adult <i>Drosophila</i> walk using six multi-jointed legs, each controlled by ∼50 leg motoneurons (MNs). Although MNs have stereotyped morphologies, little is known about how they are specified. Here, we describe the function of Hox genes and <i>homothorax</i> (<i>hth</i>), which encodes a Hox co-factor, in <i>Drosophila</i> leg MN development. Removing either Hox or Hth function from a single neuroblast (NB) lineage results in MN apoptosis. A single Hox gene, <i>Antennapedia</i> (<i>Antp</i>), is primarily responsible for MN survival in all three thoracic segments. When cell death is blocked, partially penetrant axon branching errors are observed in Hox mutant MNs. When single MNs are mutant, errors in both dendritic and axon arborizations are observed. Our data also suggest that Antp levels in post-mitotic MNs are important for specifying their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ities. Thus, in addition to being essential for survival, Hox and <i>hth</i> are required to specify accurate MN morphologies in a level-dependent manner.</p>

Anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning are coordinated by an identical patterning clock
<p>Establishment of the body plan in vertebrates depends on the temporally coordinated patterning of tissues along the body axes. We have previously shown that dorsoventral (DV) tissues are temporally patterned progressively from anterior to posterior by a BMP signaling pathway. Here we report that DV patterning along the zebrafish anteroposterior (AP) axis is temporally coordinated with AP patterning by an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ident</span></strong>ical patterning clock. We altered AP patterning by inhibiting or activating FGF, Wnt or retinoic acid signaling combined with inhibition of BMP signaling at a series of developmental time points, which revealed that the temporal progression of DV patterning is directly coordinated with AP patterning. We investigated how these signaling pathways are integrated and suggest a model for how DV and AP patterning are temporally coordinated. It has been shown that in <i>Xenopus</i> dorsal tissues FGF and Wnt signaling quell BMP signaling by degrading phosphorylated (P) Smad1/5, the BMP pathway signal transducer, via phosphorylation of the Smad1/5 linker region. We show that in zebrafish FGF/MAPK, but not Wnt/GSK3, phosphorylation of the Smad1/5 linker region localizes to a ventral vegetal gastrula region that could coordinate DV patterning with AP patterning ventrally without degrading P-Smad1/5. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alteration of the MAPK phosphorylation sites in the Smad5 linker causes precocious patterning of DV tissues along the AP axis during gastrulation. Thus, DV and AP patterning are intimately coordinated to allow cells to acquire both positional and temporal information simultaneously.</p>

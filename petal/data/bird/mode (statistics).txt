Defining modes of failure after joint-preserving surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Joint-preserving surgery of the hip (JPSH) has evolved considerably   and now includes a number of procedures, including arthroscopy,   surgical dislocation, and redirectional osteotomies of the femur   and acetabulum. There are a number of different factors which lead   to failure of JPSH. Consequently, it is of interest to assess the   various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s of failure in order to continue to identify best practice   and the indications for these procedures. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using a retrospective observational study design, we reviewed   1013 patients who had undergone JPSH by a single surgeon between   2005 and 2015. There were 509 men and 504 women with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age   of 39 years (16 to 78). Of the 1013 operations, 783 were arthroscopies,   122 surgical dislocations, and 108 peri-acetabular osteotomies (PAO).   We analysed the overall failure rates and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s of failure. Re-operations   were categorised into four groups: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> 1 was arthritis progression   or organ failure leading to total hip arthroplasty (THA); <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> 2   was an Incorrect diagnosis/procedure; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> 3 resulted from malcorrection   of femur (type A), acetabulum (type B), or labrum (type C) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> 4   resulted from an unintended consequence of the initial surgical   intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of 2.5 years, there had been 104 re-operations   (10.2%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> patient age of 35.5 years (17 to 64).

There were   17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> 2 failures (1.7%) at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 2.2 years post-JPSH with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> patient age of 28.9 years (17 to 42) (2% scopes; 1% surgical   dislocations). There were 19 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> 3 failures (1.9%) at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of   2.0 years post-JPSH, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> patient age of 29.9 years (18 to   51) (2% scopes; 2% surgical dislocations; 5% PAO).

Spatiotemporal mode-locking in multimode fiber lasers
<p>A laser is based on the electromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s of its resonator, which provides the feedback required for oscillation. Enormous progress has been made toward controlling the interactions of longitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s in lasers with a single transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>. For example, the field of ultrafast science has been built on lasers that lock many longitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s together to form ultrashort light pulses. However, coherent superposition of longitudinal and transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s in a laser has received little attention. We show that modal and chromatic dispersions in fiber lasers can be counteracted by strong spatial and spectral filtering. This allows locking of multiple transverse and longitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s to create ultrashort pulses with a variety of spatiotemporal profiles. Multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> fiber lasers thus open new directions in studies of nonlinear wave propagation and capabilities for applications.</p>

Monitoring and manipulating Higgs and Goldstone modes in a supersolid quantum gas
<p>Higgs and Goldstone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s are collective excitations of the amplitude and phase of an order parameter that is related to the breaking of a continuous symmetry. We directly studied these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s in a supersolid quantum gas created by coupling a Bose-Einstein condensate to two optical cavities, whose field amplitudes form the real and imaginary parts of a U(1)-symmetric order parameter. Monitoring the cavity fields in real time allowed us to observe the dynamics of the associated Higgs and Goldstone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s and revealed their amplitude and phase nature. We used a spectroscopic method to measure their frequencies, and we gave a tunable mass to the Goldstone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> by exploring the crossover between continuous and discrete symmetry. Our experiments link spectroscopic measurements to the theoretical concept of Higgs and Goldstone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s.</p>

Total hip arthroplasty using a monobloc cementless femoral stem for patients with childhood Perthes’ disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Modular or custom-made femoral components have been preferred   for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with a history of Perthes’   disease because of the distortion in the anatomy of the proximal   femur. However, it has not been established whether a monobloc cementless   stem will fit the distorted proximal femur or whether the results   of the procedure are satisfactory in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 68 consecutive patients who had undergone THA for   childhood Perthes’ disease between June 2003 and December 2008.   There were 35 men and 33 women with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 48 years (16 to   73) at the time of index arthroplasty. Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> body mass index   was 24.4 (18.3 to 32.9). Of the 68 hips, 32 were classified as Stulberg   class III and 36 as class IV. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> pre-operative shortening   of the affected leg was 17.2 mm (5 to 34). The minimum follow-up   was five years (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 8.5 years; 5.2 to 10).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>An intra-operative calcar fracture occurred in eight hips (11.8%)   and was successfully treated by cerclage wiring. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> stem version   was 14.6° (-2.3 to 30; standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 7.3). The   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> acetabular component abduction was 40.2° (23.7 to 56.0; <sc>sd</sc> 6.5)   and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> anteversion 28.3° (6.4 to 43.0; <sc>sd</sc> 7.6), respectively.   The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 8.5 years (5.2 to 10). No dislocations occurred   and no hips were revised during the course of the study. At final   follow-up, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Harris Hip Score was 91 points (59 to 100) and   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> University of California, Los Angeles activity score was   3.2 (2 to 8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Monobloc cementless stems reliably restore the anatomy in Perthes’   disease at THA without the need for custom-made or modular implants.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:440–444.</p></sec>

Ligand- and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels differentially regulate the mode of vesicular neuropeptide release in mammalian sensory neurons
<p>Neuropeptides released from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons play essential roles in the neurotransmission of sensory inputs, including those underlying nociception and pathological pain. Neuropeptides are released from intracellular vesicles through two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s: a partial release <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> called “kiss-and-run” (KAR) and a full release <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> called “full fusion–like” (FFL). Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we traced the release of pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein–tagged neuropeptide Y (pHluorin-NPY) from individual dense-core vesicles in the soma and axon of single DRG neurons after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through either voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) or ligand-gated transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through VGCCs stimulated FFL and a greater single release of neuropeptides. In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV1 channels stimulated KAR and a pulsed but prolonged release of neuropeptides that was partially mediated by Dynamin 1, which limits fusion pore expansion. Suppressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient to an extent similar to that seen after TRPV1 activation abolished the VGCC preference for FFL. The findings suggest that by generating a steeper Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient, VGCCs promote a more robust fusion pore opening that facilitates FFL. Thus, KAR and FFL release <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s are differentially regulated by the two principal types of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels in DRG neurons.</p>

Minimally invasive surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to report a retrospective, consecutive   series of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who   were treated with posterior minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of two years (<sc>sd</sc> 1.4; 0.9 to 0 3.7). Our   objectives were to measure the correction of the deformity and record   the peri-operative morbidity. Special attention was paid to the   operating time (ORT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay   (LOS) and further complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively collected the data of 70 consecutive patients   with AIS treated with MIS using three incisions and a muscle-splitting   approach by a single surgeon between June 2013 and February 2016   and these were retrospectively reviewed. There were eight male and   62 female patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 15 years (<sc>sd</sc> 4.5   ) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> body mass index of 19.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<sc>sd</sc> 5.4).   The curves were classified according to Lenke; 40 curves were type   1, 15 were type 2, three were type 3, two were type 4, eight were   type 5 and two were type 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> primary Cobb angle was corrected from 58.9° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.6°)   pre-operatively to 17.7° (<sc>sd</sc> 10.2°) post-operatively with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> correction of 69% (<sc>sd</sc> 20%, p < 0.001). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   kyphosis at T5 to T12 increased from 24.2° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.2°) pre-operatively   to 30.1° (<sc>sd</sc> 9.6°,    p < 0.001) post-operatively.

Magnetic seismology of interstellar gas clouds: Unveiling a hidden dimension
<p>Stars and planets are formed inside dense interstellar molecular clouds by processes imprinted on the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the clouds. Determining the 3D structure of interstellar clouds remains challenging because of projection effects and difficulties measuring the extent of the clouds along the line of sight. We report the detection of normal vibrational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s in the isolated interstellar cloud Musca, allowing determination of the 3D physical dimensions of the cloud. We found that Musca is vibrating globally, with the characteristic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s of a sheet viewed edge on, not the characteristics of a filament as previously supposed. We reconstructed the physical properties of Musca through 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, reproducing the observed normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s and confirming a sheetlike morphology.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Theory
<p>Topological insulators are phases of matter characterized by topological edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder. These attributes make topological insulator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits topological effects in a unique way: the topological insulator laser. These are lasers whose lasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> exhibits topologically protected transport without magnetic fields. The underlying topological properties lead to a highly efficient laser, robust to defects and disorder, with single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> lasing even at very high gain values. The topological insulator laser alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and at the same time opens exciting possibilities in topological physics, such as topologically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the topological insulator laser provides a route to arrays of semiconductor lasers that operate as one single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> high-power laser coupled efficiently into an output port.</p>

Regional and global sea-surface temperatures during the last interglaciation
<p>The last interglaciation (LIG, 129 to 116 thousand years ago) was the most recent time in Earth’s history when global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> sea level was substantially higher than it is at present. However, reconstructions of LIG global temperature remain uncertain, with estimates ranging from no significant difference to nearly 2°C warmer than present-day temperatures. Here we use a network of sea-surface temperature (SST) records to reconstruct spatiotemporal variability in regional and global SSTs during the LIG. Our results indicate that peak LIG global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> annual SSTs were 0.5 ± 0.3°C warmer than the climatological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> from 1870 to 1889 and indistinguishable from the 1995 to 2014 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>. LIG warming in the extratropical latitudes occurred in response to boreal insolation and the bipolar seesaw, whereas tropical SSTs were slightly cooler than the 1870 to 1889 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> in response to reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> annual insolation.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Actin Reorganization Triggers Rapid Cell Elongation in Roots
<p>Root growth is controlled by mechanisms underlying cell division and cell elongation, which respond to various internal and external factors. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), cells produced in the proximal meristem (PM) elongate and differentiate in the transition zone (TZ) and the elongation/differentiation zone (EDZ). Previous studies have demonstrated that endoreplication is involved in root cell elongation; however, the manner by which cells increase in length by more than 2-fold remains unknown. Here, we show that epidermal and cortical cells in Arabidopsis roots undergo two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s of rapid cell elongation: the first rapid cell elongation occurs at the border of the proximal meristem and the TZ, and the second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> occurs during the transition from the TZ to the EDZ. Our previous study showed that cytokinin signaling promotes endoreplication, which triggers the first rapid cell elongation. Our cytological and genetic data revealed that the second rapid cell elongation involves dynamic actin reorganization independent of endoreplication. Cytokinins promote actin bundling and the resultant second rapid cell elongation through activating the signaling pathway involving the cytokinin receptors ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE3 (AHK3) and AHK4 and the B-type transcription factor ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR2. Our results suggest that cytokinins promote the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s of rapid cell elongation by controlling distinct cellular events: endoreplication and actin reorganization.</p>

While the radiographic factors contributing to flexion instability   have been elucidated, the clinical diagnosis remains challenging.   Our aim, in this study, was to determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> white cell count   and differential profile in pre-operative aspirations of synovial   fluid in a consecutive series of patients undergoing revision TKA   for flexion instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2000 and 2010, 60 patients undergoing aseptic revision   TKA for flexion instability were identified. The results of the   pre-operative aspiration of synovial fluid were available for 53   patients (88%). These patients were 1:2 matched to 106 patients   who underwent aseptic TKA for indications other than flexion instability.   The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of the patients at revision TKA was 65 years (44 to   82) and 55% were women. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 4.3 years (2 to 10.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the flexion instability group, the median total cell count   was 312 cells/µL (interquartile range (IQR) 104 to 624), with a   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> distribution of 45% macrophages (2% to 90%), 30% lymphocytes   (1% to 69%), 18% neutrophils (0% to 80%), 0.5% eosinophils (0% to   6%) and 7% other cells (0% to 42%; mainly synovial cells). There   was no significant difference in the median total cell count (p   = 0.14) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> distribution of macrophages (p = 0.42), lymphocytes   (p = 0.38), neutrophils (p = 0.19) and eosinophils (p = 0.89) between   the flexion instability and control groups. There was a significant   difference in the percentage of bloody serosanguineous aspirations   which was 58% in the flexion instability group and 18% in the control   group (odds ratio = 6.5; p = 0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the group of patients who underwent revision TKA for flexion   instability, most had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> cell count and differential similar   to those who underwent revision for other aseptic indications. However,   bloody serosanguineous aspirations were 6.5 times more common in   those with flexion instability confirming that many of the recurrent   effusions seen in this condition are haemarthroses.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1477–81.</p></sec>

The challenge of Monteggia-like lesions of the elbow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this retrospective multicentre study was to evaluate   mid-term results of the operative treatment of Monteggia-like lesions   and to determine the prognostic factors that influence the clinical   and radiological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients (27 women and 19 men), with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age   of 57.7 years (18 to 84) who had sustained a Monteggia-like lesion   were followed up clinically and radiologically after surgical treatment.   The Mayo Modified Wrist Score (MMWS), Mayo Elbow Performance Score   (MEPS), Broberg and Morrey Score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (DASH) score were used for evaluation at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 65 months   (27 to 111) postoperatively. All ulnar fractures were stabilized   using a proximally contoured or precontoured locking compression   plate. Mason type I fractures of the radial head were treated conservatively, type   II fractures were treated with reconstruction, and type III fractures   with arthroplasty. All Morrey type II and III fractures of the coronoid   process was stabilized using lag screws.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Good results were found for the MMWS, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 88.4 (40 to   100). There were 29 excellent results (63%), nine good (20%), seven   satisfactory (15%), and one poor (2%). Excellent results were obtained   for the MEPS, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 90.7 (70 to 100): 31 excellent results   (68%), 13 good (28%), and two fair (4%). Good results were also   found for the functional rating index of Broberg and Morrey, with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> score of 86.6 (57 to 100).

Mapping the stochastic sequence of individual ligand-receptor binding events to cellular activation: T cells act on the rare events
<p>T cell receptor (TCR) binding to agonist peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) triggers signaling events that initiate T cell responses. This system is remarkably sensitive, requiring only a few binding events to successfully activate a cellular response. On <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e, activating pMHC ligands exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> dwell times of at least a few seconds when bound to the TCR. However, a T cell accumulates pMHC-TCR interactions as a stochastic series of discrete, single-molecule binding events whose individual dwell times are broadly distributed. With activation occurring in response to only a handful of such binding events, individual cells are unlikely to experience the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e binding time. Here, we mapped the ensemble of pMHC-TCR binding events in space and time while simultaneously monitoring cellular activation. Our findings revealed that T cell activation hinges on rare, long–dwell time binding events that are an order of magnitude longer than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e agonist pMHC-TCR dwell time. Furthermore, we observed that short pMHC-TCR binding events that were spatially correlated and temporally sequential led to cellular activation. These observations indicate that T cell antigen discrimination likely occurs by sensing the tail end of the pMHC-TCR binding dwell time distribution rather than its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e properties.</p>

Successful return to sports in athletes following non-operative management of acute isolated posterior cruciate ligament injuries
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to report the outcome of the non-operative   treatment of high-grade posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries,   particularly Hughston grade III injuries, which have not previously   been described.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a prospective study involving 46 consecutive patients   who were athletes with MRI-confirmed isolated PCL injuries presenting   within four weeks of injury. All had Hughston grade II (25 athletes)   or III (21 athletes) injuries. Our non-operative treatment regimen   involved initial bracing, followed by an individualised rehabilitation   programme determined by the symptoms and physical signs.

Early performance-based and patient-reported outcomes of a contemporary taper fit bone-conserving short stem femoral component in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare early functional and health   related quality of life outcomes (HRQoL) in patients who have undergone   total hip arthroplasty (THA) using a bone conserving short stem   femoral component and those in whom a conventional length uncemented   component was used. Outcome was assessed using a validated performance   based outcome instrument as well as patient reported outcome measures   (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively analysed 33 patients whose THA involved a contemporary   proximally porous coated tapered short stem femoral component and   53 patients with a standard conventional femoral component, at a   minimum follow-up of two years.

Satisfaction, function and repair integrity after arthroscopic <i>versus</i> mini-open rotator cuff repair
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advances in arthroscopic techniques for rotator cuff repair have   made the mini-open approach less popular. However, the mini-open   approach remains an important technique for repair for many surgeons.   The aims of this study were to compare the integrity of the repair,   the function of the shoulder and satisfaction post-operatively using   these two techniques in patients aged > 50 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 22 patients treated with mini-open and 128 patients   treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of July 2007 and June   2011. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was two years (1 to 5). Outcome was assessed   using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Simple   Shoulder Test (SST) scores, and satisfaction. The integrity of the repair   was assessed using ultrasonography. A power analysis ensured sufficient   enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no statistically significant difference between the   age, function, satisfaction, or pain scores (p > 0.05) of the two   groups. The integrity of the repair and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> SST scores were   significantly better in the mini-open group (91% of mini-open repairs   were intact <i>versus</i> 60% of arthroscopic repairs,   p = 0.023; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> SST score 10.9 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   1.3) in the mini-open group; 8.9 (<sc>sd</sc> 3.5) in arthroscopic   group; p = 0.003). The ASES scores were also higher in the mini-open   group (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> ASES score 91.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 10.5) in mini-open group;   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 82.70 (<sc>sd</sc> 19.8) in the arthroscopic group; p = 0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The integrity of the repair and function of the shoulder were   better after a mini-open repair than after arthroscopic repair of   a rotator cuff tear in these patients.

Quantifying the ‘law of diminishing returns’ in magnetically controlled growing rods
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) allow non-invasive   correction of the spinal deformity in the treatment of early-onset   scoliosis. Conventional growing rod systems (CGRS) need repeated   surgical distractions: these are associated with the effect of the   ‘law of diminishing returns’.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to quantify this effect in   MCGRs over sequential distractions. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 35 patients with a maximum follow-up of 57 months   were included in the study. There were 17 boys and 18 girls with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 7.4 years (2 to 14). True Distraction (TD) was determined   by measuring the expansion gap on fluoroscopy. This was compared   with Intended Distraction (ID) and expressed as the ‘T/I’ ratio.   The T/I ratio and the Cobb angle were calculated at several time   points during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 30 months (6 to 57). There was a significant   decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> T/I ratio over time (convex rod at 3 months   0.81, <sc>sd</sc> 0.58 <i>vs</i> 51 months 0.17, <sc>sd </sc>0.16,    p = 0.0001; concave rod at 3 months 0.93, <sc>sd</sc> 0.67 <i>vs</i> 51   months 0.18, <sc>sd</sc> 0.15, p = 0.0001). A linear decline of   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> T/I ratios was noted for both convex rods (r<sup>2</sup> =   0.90, p = 0.004) and concave rods (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.81, p = 0.015)   over 51 months. At the 24-month follow-up stage, there was a significant   negative correlation between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> T/I ratio of the concave rod   with weight (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), age (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), and   BMI of the child (r = -0.54,    p = 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ‘law of diminishing returns’ is also seen after serial distraction   using MCGR. Compared to previously published data for CGRS, there   is a gradual linear decline rather than a rapid initial decline   in lengthening. In older, heavier children a reduced distraction   ratio in the concave rod of the MCGR device is noted over time.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1658–64.</p></sec>

Cemented total hip arthroplasty following acetabular fracture
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the outcomes of cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA)   following a fracture of the acetabulum, with evaluation of risk   factors and comparison with a patient group with no history of fracture. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 1992 and 2016, 49 patients (33 male) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of   57 years (25 to 87) underwent cemented THA at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 6.5 years   (0.1 to 25) following acetabular fracture. A total of 38 had undergone   surgical fixation and 11 had been treated non-operatively; 13 patients   died at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 10.2 years after THA (0.6 to 19). Patients were   assessed pre-operatively, at one year and at final follow-up (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   9.1 years, 0.5 to 23) using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS). Implant   survivorship was assessed. An age and gender-matched cohort of THAs   performed for non-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) or avascular necrosis   (AVN) (n = 98) were used to compare complications and patient-reported outcome   measures (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> time from fracture to THA was significantly shorter   for patients with AVN    (2.2 years) or protrusio (2.2 years) than those with post-traumatic   OA (9.4 years) or infection (8.0 years) (p = 0.03). Nine contained   and four uncontained defects were managed with autograft (n = 11),   bulk allograft (n = 1), or trabecular metal augment (n = 1). Initial   fracture management (open reduction and internal fixation or non-operative),   timing of THA    (>/< one year), and age (>/< 55 years) had no significant   effect on OHS or ten-year survival. Six THAs were revised at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   of 12 years (5 to 23) with ten-year all-cause survival of 92% (95%   confidence interval 80.8 to 100). THA complication rates (all complications,   heterotopic ossification, leg length discrepancy > 10 mm) were significantly higher   following acetabular fracture compared with atraumatic OA/AVN and   OHSs were inferior: one-year OHS    (35.7 v<i>ersus</i> 40.2, p = 0.026); and final follow-up   OHS (33.6 v<i>ersus</i> 40.9, p = 0.008). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Cemented THA is a reasonable option for the sequelae of acetabular   fracture.

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological deterioration, or deformity   correction in later life. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological deterioration at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   deterioration were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without neurological deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.

What is the morbidity of a non-invasive growing prosthesis?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Extendible endoprostheses have been available for more than 30   years and have become more sophisticated with time. The latest generation   is ‘non-invasive’ and can be lengthened with an external magnetic   force. Early results have shown a worryingly high rate of complications   such as infection. This study investigates the incidence of complications   and the need for further surgery in a cohort of patients with a   non-invasive growing endoprosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2003 and June 2014, 50 children (51 prostheses) had a   non-invasive growing prosthesis implanted for a primary bone sarcoma.   The minimum follow-up was 24 months for those who survived. Their   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age was 10.4 years (6 to 14). The incidence of complications   and further surgery was documented.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 64 months (20 to 145). The overall survivorship   of the patients was 84% at three years and 70% at five years. Revision-free   survival was 81.7% at three years and 61.6% at five years with competing   risk analysis. Deep infection occurred in 19.6% of implants at a   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 12.5 months (0 to 55). Other complications were a failure   of the lengthening mechanism in five prostheses (9.8%) and breakage   of the implant in two (3.9%). Overall, there were 53 additional   operations (0 to 5 per patient). A total of seven patients (14%)   underwent amputation, three for local recurrence and four for infection.   Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> limb length discrepancy was 4.3 mm (0 to 25) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Musculoskeletal   Tumor Society Score functional score was 26.5 (18 to 30) at the   final follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>When compared with previously published early results, this mid-term   series has shown continued good functional outcomes and compensation   for leg-length discrepancy.

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> time for fracture site pain   to cease was 6.2 months (1.2 to 17.1). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> time to radiological   union was 10.0 months (2.2 to 27.5). Implant failure was seen in   seven patients (23%, 95 confidence interval (CI) 11.8 to 40.9).   Revision surgery was required in ten patients (33%, 95 CI 19.2 to   51.2).</p><p>A large proportion of the patients required revision surgery   and suffered implant failure.

Clinical outcomes following re-admission for non-infectious wound complications after primary total knee replacement
<p>Haematomas, drainage, and other non-infectious   wound complications following total knee replacement (TKR) have   been associated with long-term sequelae, in particular, deep infection.   However, the impact of these wound complications on clinical outcome   is unknown. This study compares results in 15 patients re-admitted   for wound complications within 90 days of TKR to 30 matched patients   who underwent uncomplicated total knee replacements. Patients with   wound complications had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 66 years (49 to 83) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   body mass index (BMI) of 37 (21 to 54), both similar to that of   patients without complications (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age 65 years and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> BMI 35). Those   with complications had lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Knee Society function scores (46   (0 to 100 <i>vs</i> 66 (20 to 100), p = 0.047) and a higher   incidence of mild or greater pain (73% <i>vs</i> 33%,   p = 0.01) after two years compared with the non re-admitted group.   Expectations in patients with wound complications following TKR   should be tempered, even in those who do not develop an infection.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:619–21.</p>

Mid-term results of lateral unicondylar mobile bearing knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this independent multicentre study was to assess the   mid-term results of mobile bearing unicondylar knee arthroplasty   (UKA) for isolated lateral osteoarthritis of the knee joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively evaluated 363 consecutive, lateral UKAs (346   patients) performed using the Oxford domed lateral prosthesis undertaken   in three high-volume knee arthroplasty centres between 2006 and   2014. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of the patients at surgery was 65 years (36 to 88)   with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> final follow-up of 37 months (12 to 93)</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 (10.5%) patients underwent revision surgery, giving   a survival rate of 90.1% at three years (95% confidence intervals   (CI) 86.1 to 93.1; number at risk: 155) and 85.0% at five years   (95% CI 77.9 to 89.9; number at risk: 43).

Thirty-Day Readmissions After Endovascular or Surgical Therapy for Critical Limb Ischemia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thirty-day readmission rates have gained increasing importance as a key quality metric. A significant number of patients are hospitalized for the management of critical limb ischemia (CLI), but limited data are available on the incidence, predictors, and causes of 30-day readmission after hospitalization for CLI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Hospitalizations for a primary diagnosis of CLI during which patients underwent endovascular or surgical therapy (revascularization and/or amputation) and were discharged alive were identified in the 2013 to 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Databases. Incidence, reasons, and costs of 30-day unplanned readmissions were determined. Hierarchical logistic regression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>ls were used to identify independent predictors of 30-day readmissions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 60 998 (national estimate, 135 110) index CLI hospitalizations (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age, 68.9±11.9 years; 40.8% women; 24.6% for rest pain, 37.2% for ulcer, and 38.2% for gangrene). The 30-day readmission rate was 20.4%. Presentation with ulcer or gangrene, age ≥65 years, female sex, large hospital size, teaching hospital status, known coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, anemia, coagulopathy, obesity, major bleeding, acute myocardial infarction, vascular complications, and sepsis were identified as independent predictors of 30-day readmission. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> of revascularization was not independently associated with readmissions. Infections (23.5%), persistent or recurrent manifestations of peripheral artery disease (22.2%), cardiac conditions (11.4%), procedural complications (11.0%), and endocrine issues (5.7%) were the most common reasons for readmission. The inflation-adjusted aggregate costs of 30-day readmissions for CLI during the study period were $624 million.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Approximately 1 in 5 patients hospitalized for CLI and undergoing revascularization is readmitted within 30 days.

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often estimated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine samples on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine sample between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection during a 17-year follow-up. Sodium intake was estimated with a single baseline collection and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e of samples collected during a 1-, 5-, and 15-year follow-up. We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine samples. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e 24-hour sodium excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88). However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term estimations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e was used, respectively. Consequently, hazard ratios for cardiorenal outcome changed up to 85% with the use of sodium intake estimations from short-term (1-year) and long-term (5-year) follow-up instead of baseline estimations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Relative to a single baseline 24-hour sodium measurement, the use of subsequent 24-hour urine samples resulted in different estimations of an individual’s sodium intake, whereas population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>es remained similar. This finding had significant consequences for the association between sodium intake and long-term cardiovascular and renal outcomes.</p></sec>

Signatures of exciton condensation in a transition metal dichalcogenide
<p>Bose condensation has shaped our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors, atomic gases, and liquid helium. Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to condense into either a superfluid or an insulating electronic crystal. Using the recently developed technique of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moment</span></strong>um‐resolved electron energy‐loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied electronic collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s in the transition metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1<i>T</i>‐TiSe<sub>2</sub>. Near the phase-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> fell to zero at nonzero <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moment</span></strong>um, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of the valence electrons into an exciton condensate. Our study provides compelling evidence for exciton condensation in a three-dimensional solid and establishes M-EELS as a versatile technique sensitive to valence band excitations in quantum materials.</p>

Topological origin of equatorial waves
<p>Topology sheds new light on the emergence of unidirectional edge waves in a variety of physical systems, from condensed matter to artificial lattices. Waves observed in geophysical flows are also robust to perturbations, which suggests a role for topology. We show a topological origin for two well-known equatorially trapped waves, the Kelvin and Yanai <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s, owing to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by Earth’s rotation. The nontrivial structure of the bulk PoincaréÉééé wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s encoded through the first Chern number of value 2 guarantees the existence of these waves. This invariant demonstrates that ocean and atmospheric waves share fundamental properties with topological insulators and that topology plays an unexpected role in Earth’s climate system.</p>

Assisted by chaotic motions, broadband light can travel between optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s with different angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moment</span></strong>a within a few picoseconds. Efficient coupling from visible to near-infrared bands is demonstrated between a nanowaveguide and whispering gallery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s with quality factors exceeding 10 million. The broadband <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moment</span></strong>um transformation enhances the device conversion efficiency of the third-harmonic generation by greater than three orders of magnitude over the conventional evanescent-wave coupling. The observed broadband and fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moment</span></strong>um transformation could promote applications such as multicolor lasers, broadband memories, and multiwavelength optical networks.</p>

Chiral Majorana fermion modes in a quantum anomalous Hall insulator–superconductor structure
<p>Majorana fermion is a hypothetical particle that is its own antiparticle. We report transport measurements that suggest the existence of one-dimensional chiral Majorana fermion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s in the hybrid system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film coupled with a superconductor. As the external magnetic field is swept, half-integer quantized conductance plateaus are observed at the locations of magnetization reversals, giving a distinct signature of the Majorana fermion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s. This transport signature is reproducible over many magnetic field sweeps and appears at different temperatures.

Dual-comb spectroscopy of water vapor with a free-running semiconductor disk laser
<p>Dual-comb spectroscopy offers the potential for high accuracy combined with fast data acquisition. Applications are often limited, however, by the complexity of optical comb systems. Here we present dual-comb spectroscopy of water vapor using a substantially simplified single-laser system. Very good spectroscopy measurements with fast sampling rates are achieved with a free-running dual-comb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>-locked semiconductor disk laser. The absolute stability of the optical comb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>s is characterized both for free-running operation and with simple microwave stabilization. This approach drastically reduces the complexity for dual-comb spectroscopy. Band-gap engineering to tune the center wavelength from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared could optimize frequency combs for specific gas targets, further enabling dual-comb spectroscopy for a wider range of industrial applications.</p>

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the environment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and environment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>ed across individuals. Therefore, computational methods are used to reconstruct representative prototypes using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and calculating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>s. The same problem applies to the root system architecture (RSA) of plants. Several computer programs are available for extracting numerical data from root images, but they usually do not offer customized data analysis or visual reconstruction of RSA. We developed Root-VIS, a free software tool that facilitates the determination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>s and variance of many different RSA features across user-selected sets of root images. Furthermore, Root-VIS offers several options to generate visual reconstructions of root systems from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>ed data to enable screening and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>ling. We confirmed the suitability of Root-VIS, combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo, for the rapid characterization of genotype-environment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Sulforaphane Modifies Histone H3, Unpacks Chromatin, and Primes Defense
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>rn crop production calls for agrochemicals that prime plants for enhanced defense. Reliable test systems for spotting priming-inducing chemistry, however, are rare. We developed an assay for the high-throughput search for compounds that prime microbial pattern-induced secretion of antimicrobial furanocoumarins (phytoalexins) in cultured parsley cells. The screen produced 1-isothiocyanato-4-methylsulfinylbutane (sulforaphane; SFN), a secondary metabolite in many crucifers, as a novel defense priming compound. While elucidating SFN’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> of action in defense priming, we found that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) the isothiocyanate provokes covalent modification (K4me3, K9ac) of histone H3 in the promoter and promoter-proximal region of defense genes <i>WRKY6</i> and <i>PDF1</i>.<i>2</i>, but not <i>PR1</i>. SFN-triggered H3K4me3 and H3K9ac coincide with chromatin unpacking in the <i>WRKY6</i> and <i>PDF1</i>.<i>2</i> regulatory regions, primed <i>WRKY6</i> expression, unprimed <i>PDF1</i>.<i>2</i> activation, and reduced susceptibility to downy mildew disease (<i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i>). Because SFN also directly inhibits <i>H</i>. <i>arabidopsidis</i> and other plant pathogens, the isothiocyanate is promising for the development of a plant protectant with a dual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> of action.</p>

Functional outcome of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention in periprosthetic joint infection involving the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advocates of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR)   in hip periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) argue that a procedure   not disturbing a sound prosthesis-bone interface is likely to lead   to better survival and functional outcome compared with revision.   This case-control study aims were to compare outcome of DAIRs for   infected primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with outcomes following   primary THA and two-stage revision of infected primary THAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed all DAIRs, performed for confirmed   infected primary hip arthropasty (n = 82) at out institution, between   1997 and 2013. Data recorded included full patient information and   type of surgery. Outcome measures included complications, mortality,   implant survivorship and functional outcome. Outcome was compared with   two control groups matched for gender and age; a cohort of primary   THAs (n = 120) and a cohort of two-stage revisions for infection   (n = 66).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age at DAIR was 69 years (33 to 87) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was   eight years (2 to 17; standard deviation (<sc>sd)</sc> 5). A total   of 52 (63%) of DAIRs were for early PJI (less than six weeks). Greater   success in the eradication of infection with DAIR was identified   with early PJI, comprising an interval less than a week between   onset of symptoms and exchange of modular components with the DAIR   procedure. Eradication of infection, complications and re-operation   rates were similar in the DAIR and two-stage revision groups. For   hips with successful eradication of infection with DAIR, the five-year   survival (98%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 94 to 100) was similar   to the primary THA group (98%; 95% CI 95 to 100) (n = 43; p = 0.3).   The DAIR group had inferior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Oxford Hip Scores (OHS) (38; 12   to 48) compared with the primary THA group (42; 15 to 48) (p = 0.02)   but a significantly better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> OHS compared with the two-stage   revision group (31; 0 to 48) (p = 0.008). Patients who required   only one DAIR for eradication of infection had a similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> OHS   (41; 20 to 48) to the primary THA group (p = 0.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The DAIR procedure is associated with a similar complication   rate and ability to eradicate infection as two-stage revision. This   study emphasises the need for exchange of modular components for   improved chances of eradication of infection. This is the first   study showing that DAIR is better than a two-stage revision regarding   functional outcome.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:614–22.</p></sec>

Management of massive acetabular bone defects in revision arthroplasty of the hip using a reconstruction cage and porous metal augment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It may not be possible to undertake revision total hip arthroplasty   (THA) in the presence of massive loss of acetabular bone stock using   standard cementless hemispherical acetabular components and metal   augments, as satisfactory stability cannot always be achieved. We   aimed to study the outcome using a reconstruction cage and a porous   metal augment in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 22 acetabular revisions in 19 patients were performed   using a combination of a reconstruction cage and porous metal augments.   The augments were used in place of structural allografts. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   age of the patients at the time of surgery was 70 years (27 to 85)   and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 39 months (27 to 58). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> number   of previous THAs was 1.9 (1 to 3). All patients had segmental defects   involving more than 50% of the acetabulum and seven hips had an   associated pelvic discontinuity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three failures were observed in two hips, both of which had undergone   a previous resection of a tumour affecting the acetabulum. Other   complications included a late arterial injury, a sciatic nerve palsy,   a dislocation treated with a femoral revision, a deep infection   treated with irrigation and debridement and a fracture of the greater   trochanter treated conservatively. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Oxford Hip Score significantly   increased from 13.9 (2 to 23) to 28.7 (13 to 38) (p < 0.00001).   The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> vertical distance between the centre of rotation of the   hip and its normal location decreased from 30 mm to 10 mm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Acceptable early survivorship can be achieved using this novel   technique, but it may be unsuitable for use in patients who have   previously undergone the resection of a tumour involving the acetabulum.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:607–13.</p></sec>

Dislocation following total hip arthroplasty using dual mobility acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this systematic review was to report the rate of dislocation   following the use of dual mobility (DM) acetabular components in   primary and revision total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review of the literature according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines   was performed. A comprehensive search of Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane   Library and Embase (Scopus) was conducted for English articles between   January 1974 and March 2016 using various combinations of the keywords “dual   mobility”, “dual-mobility”, “tripolar”, “double-mobility”, “double   mobility”, “hip”, “cup”, “socket”. The following data were extracted   by two investigators independently: demographics, whether the operation   was a primary or revision THA, length of follow-up, the design of   the components, diameter of the femoral head, and type of fixation   of the acetabular component.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 59 articles met our inclusion criteria. These included   a total of 17 908 THAs which were divided into two groups: studies   dealing with DM components in primary THA and those dealing with   these components in revision THA. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> rate of dislocation was   0.9% in the primary THA group, and 3.0% in the revision THA group.   The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> rate of intraprosthetic dislocation was 0.7% in primary   and 1.3% in revision THAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the current data, the use of DM acetabular components   are effective in minimising the risk of instability after both primary   and revision THA. This benefit must be balanced against continuing   concerns about the additional modularity, and the new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong> of failure   of intraprosthetic dislocation. Longer term studies are needed to   assess the function of these newer materials compared with previous   generations. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1   Supple A):18–24.</p></sec>

Minimally invasive periacetabular osteotomy using a modified Smith-Petersen approach
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Periacetabular osteotomy is an effective way of treating symptomatic   hip dysplasia. We describe a new minimally invasive technique using   a modification of the Smith-Peterson approach.</p><p>We performed a prospective, longitudinal cohort study to assess   for any compromise in acetabular correction when using this approach,   and to see if the procedure would have a higher complication rate   than that quoted in the literature for other approaches. We also   assessed for any improvement in functional outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>From 168 consecutive patients (189 hips) who underwent acetabular   correction between March 2010 and March 2013 we excluded those who   had undergone previous pelvic surgery for DDH and those being treated   for acetabular retroversion. The remaining 151 patients (15 men,   136 women) (166 hips) had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 32 years (15 to 56) and the   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> duration of follow-up was 2.8 years (1.2 to 4.5). In all 90%   of cases were Tönnis grade 0 or 1. Functional outcomes were assessed   using the Non Arthritic Hip Score (NAHS), University of California,   Los Angeles (UCLA) and Tegner activity scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> pre-operative lateral centre-edge angle was 14.2° (-5°   to 30°) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> acetabular index was 18.4° (4° to 40°). Post-operatively   these were 31° (18° to 46°) and 3° (-7° to 29°), respectively, a   significant improvement in both (p < 0.001). Allogenic blood   transfusion was required in two patients (1.2%). There were no major   nerve or vascular complications, and no wound infections. At the   time of last follow-up, we noted a significant improvement in functional   outcome scores: UCLA improved by 2.31 points, Tegner improved by   1.08 points, and the NAHS improved by 25.4 points (p < 0.001   for each). Hypermobility and longer duration of surgery were significant   negative predictors for a good post-operative UCLA score, while   residual retroversion was a positive predictor of post-operative   UCLA score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found this approach to be safe and effective, facilitating   early recovery from surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:22–8.</p></sec>

Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a standard length intramedullary cemented stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical plates have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the survivorship   of short-stemmed endoprostheses and extra-cortical plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 37 patients who underwent limb salvage surgery   for a primary neoplasm of bone between 1998 and 2013. Endoprosthetic   replacement involved the proximal humerus in nine, the proximal   femur in nine, the distal femur in 13 and the proximal tibia in   six patients. There were 12 primary (32%) and 25 revision procedures (68%).   Implant survivorship was compared with matched controls. The amount   of bone that was resected was > 70% of its length and statistically   greater than the standard control group at each anatomical site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was seven years (one to 17). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> length   of the stem was 33 mm (20 to 60) in the humerus and 79 mm (34 to   100) in the lower limb. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of the   implant according to anatomical site confirmed that there was no   statistically significant difference between the short-stemmed endoprostheses and   the standard stemmed controls at the proximal humeral (p = 0.84),   proximal femoral (p = 0.57), distal femoral (p = 0.21) and proximal   tibial (p = 0.61) sites.</p><p>In the short-stemmed group, no implants with extra-cortical plate   osseointegration suffered loosening at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 8.5 years (range   2 to 16 years). Three of ten (30%) without osseointegration suffered   aseptic loosening at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 7.7 years (range 2 to 11.5 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When extensive resections of bone are required in the surgical   management of tumours, and in revision cases, the addition of extra-cortical   plates to short medullary stems has shown non-inferiority to standard   length medullary stems and minimises aseptic failure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1689–95.</p></sec>

Clinical, functional and radiological outcomes of extracorporeal irradiation in limb salvage surgery for bone tumours
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present a retrospective review of patients treated with extracorporeally   irradiated allografts for primary and secondary bone tumours with   the mid- and long-term survivorship and the functional and radiographic   outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 113 of 116 (97.4%) patients who were treated with   extracorporeally irradiated allografts between 1996 and 2014 were   followed up. Forms of treatment included reconstructions, prostheses   and composite reconstructions, both with and without vascularised   grafts. Survivorship was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.   Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Musculoskeletal Tumor   Society (MSTS) scoring system, the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score   (TESS) and Quality of Life-C30 (QLQ-30) measures. Radiographic outcomes   were assessed using the International Society of Limb Salvage (ISOLS)   radiographic scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 61 (54%) men with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 22 years (6 to 70)   and 52 (46%) women with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 26 years (3 to 85). There   were 23 deaths. The five-year patient survivorship was 82.3% and   the ten-year patient survivorship was 79.6%. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up   of the 90 surviving patients was 80.3 months (2 to 207). At the   last follow-up, 105 allografts (92.9%) were still in place or had   been at the time of death; eight (7%) had failed due to infection,   local recurrence or fracture. Outcome scores were comparable with   or superior to those in previous studies. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> outcome scores   were: MSTS 79% (<sc>sd</sc> 8); TESS 83% (<sc>sd</sc> 19); QLQ 82%   (<sc>sd</sc> 16); ISOLS 80.5% (<sc>sd</sc> 19). </p><p>Pearson correlation analysis showed a strong relationship between   the MSTS and ISOLS scores (r = 0.71, p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that extracorporeal irradiation is a versatile   reconstructive technique for dealing with large defects after the   resection of bone tumours with good functional and radiographic   outcomes.

Medium-term outcomes of the Universal-2 total wrist arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical and radiological   outcomes of the Universal-2 total wrist arthroplasty (TWA) in patients   with rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective review of all 95 Universal-2 TWAs which   were performed in our institution between 2003 to 2012 in patients   with rheumatoid arthritis. A total of six patients were lost to   follow-up and two died of unrelated causes. A total of ten patients   had bilateral procedures. Accordingly, 75 patients (85 TWAs) were   included in the study. There were 59 women and 16 men with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   age of 59 years (26 to 86). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 53 months (24   to 120). Clinical assessment involved recording pain on a visual   analogue score, range of movement, grip strength, the Quick Disabilities   of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Wrightington wrist scores.

The patient-specific Triflange acetabular implant for revision total hip arthroplasty in patients with severe acetabular defects
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few reconstructive techniques are available for patients requiring   complex acetabular revisions such as those involving Paprosky type   2C, 3A and 3B deficiencies and pelvic discontinuity. Our aim was   to describe the development of the patient specific Triflange acetabular   component for use in these patients, the surgical technique and   mid-term results. We include a description of the pre-operative   CT scanning, the construction of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mode</span></strong></span></strong>l, operative planning, and   surgical technique. All implants were coated with porous plasma   spray and hydroxyapatite if desired.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A multicentre, retrospective review of 95 complex acetabular   reconstructions in 94 patients was performed. A total of 61 (64.2%)   were female. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of the patients was 66 (38 to 85). The   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> body mass index was 29 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (18 to 51). Outcome   was reported using the Harris Hip Score (HHS), complications, failures   and survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 3.5 years (1 to 11). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> HHS improved   from 46 (15 to 90)    pre-operatively to 75 (14 to 100). A total of 21 hips (22%) had   at least one complication with some having more than one; including   dislocation (6%), infection (6%), and femoral complications (2%).   The implant was subsequently removed in five hips (5%), only one   for suspected aseptic loosening.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Triflange patient specific acetabular component provides   predictable fixation with complication rates which are similar to   those of other techniques.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B(1   Supple A):50–4.</p></sec>

A pilot randomized trial of meniscal allograft transplantation versus personalized physiotherapy for patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee compartment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Meniscal allograft transplantation is undertaken to improve pain   and function in patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee   compartment. While case series have shown improvements in patient   reported outcome measures (PROMs), its efficacy has not been rigorously   evaluated. This study aimed to compare PROMs in patients having   meniscal transplantation with those having personalized physiotherapy   at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single-centre assessor-blinded, comprehensive cohort study,   incorporating a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed   on patients with a symptomatic compartment of the knee in which   a (sub)total meniscectomy had previously been performed. They were   randomized to be treated either with a meniscal allograft transplantation   or personalized physiotherapy, and stratified for malalignment of   the limb. They entered the preference groups if they were not willing   to be randomized. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS),   International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Lysholm   score and complications were collected at baseline and at four,   eight and 12 months following the interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 patients entered the study; 21 were randomized   and 15 chose their treatments. Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age was 28 years (range   17 to 46). The outcomes were similar in the randomized and preference   groups, allowing pooling of data. At 12 months, the KOOS<sub>4</sub> composite   score (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> difference 12, p = 0.03) and KOOS subscales of pain   (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> difference 15, p = 0.02) and activities of daily living (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   difference 18, p = 0.005) were significantly superior in the meniscal   transplantation group. Other PROMs also favoured this group without   reaching statistical significance. There were five complications   in the meniscal transplantation and one in the physiotherapy groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to compare meniscal allograft transplantation   to non-operative treatment. The results provide the best quality   evidence to date of the symptomatic benefits of meniscal allograft   transplantation in the short term, but a multicentre RCT is required   to investigate this question further.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:56–63.</p></sec>

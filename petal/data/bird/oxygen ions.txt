A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in many essential metabolic react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability. In mammals, the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulator is linked mainly to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent hydroxylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploiting bioengineered vers<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of this mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent fash<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor machinery can be used effectively to engineer a modular, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-inducible transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively controlled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> the exploitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of our genetically encoded controllers to generate plants able to switch gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> selectively depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> provis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, as visualized using the singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-specific probe singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor green. The product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell death began in the epidermal reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. In parallel, gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> changes specific to the presence of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> were observed. The accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of other reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell death. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, both the singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> scavenger His and the lip<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Serpin-protease interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After considerat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding with minimal sample consumpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We conclude that the modified diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Rapid mitochondrial adjustments in response to short-term hypoxia and re-oxygenation in the Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>
<p>As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in marine coastal habitats can fluctuate rapidly and drastically, sessile marine organisms such as the oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> can experience marked and rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. In this study, we investigated the responses of oyster gill mitochondria to short-term hypoxia (3 and 12 h, at 1.7 mg O<sub>2</sub> l<sup>−1</sup>) and subsequent re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Mitochondrial respiratory rates (states 3 and 4 stimulated by glutamate) and phosphorylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> efficiency [respiratory control ratio (RCR) and the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between ADP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> consumpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ADP/O)] were measured. Cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (CCO) activity and cytochrome concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>c</i>) were measured to investigate the rearrangements of respiratory chain subunits. The potential implicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of an alternative oxidase (AOX) was investigated using an inhibitor of the respiratory chain (antimycin A) and through gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> analysis in gills and digestive gland. Results indicate a downregulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of mitochondrial capacity, with 60% inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of respiratory rates after 12 h of hypoxia. RCR remained stable, while ADP/O increased after 12 h of hypoxia and 1 h of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, suggesting increased phosphorylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> efficiency. CCO showed a fast and remarkable increase of its catalytic activity only after 3 h of hypoxia. AOX mRNA levels showed similar patterns in gills and digestive gland, and were upregulated after 12 and 24 h of hypoxia and during re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Results suggest a set of controls regulating mitochondrial funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> fluctuat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, and demonstrate the fast and extreme plasticity of oyster mitochondria in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>).   Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA.

Histone demethylase KDM6A directly senses oxygen to control chromatin and cell fate
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensing is central to metazoan biology and has implicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s for human disease. Mammalian cells express multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent enzymes called 2-oxoglutarate (OG)-dependent di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ases (2-OGDDs), but they vary in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> affinities and hence their ability to sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>. The 2-OGDD histone demethylases control histone methylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Hypoxia increases histone methylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, but whether this reflects direct effects on histone demethylases or indirect effects caused by the hypoxic induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor or the 2-OG antagonist 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is unclear. Here, we report that hypoxia promotes histone methylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in a HIF- and 2-HG–independent manner. We found that the H3K27 histone demethylase KDM6A/UTX, but not its paralog KDM6B, is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensitive. KDM6A loss, like hypoxia, prevented H3K27 demethylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and blocked cellular differentiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Restoring H3K27 methylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis in hypoxic cells reversed these effects. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> directly affects chromatin regulators to control cell fate.</p>

Histone modifiers are oxygen sensors
<p>Approximately 2.6 bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> years ago, during the Proterozoic period, the evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria led to the introduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the by-product of this react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, into Earth's atmosphere (<i>1</i>). This great oxidative event heralded the rise of multicellular organisms, which are almost totally dependent on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> as an efficient fuel for metabolism and as a cofactor in many critical physiological enzymatic react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Central to this adaptat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and to allow cellular physiology across a wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (tens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s), metazoans have evolved the highly conserved hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway (<i>2</i>). This is important for both physiological and pathological processes that occur in a hypoxic microenvironment, including embryogenesis, stem cell homeostasis, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. It has long been observed that hypoxia induces histone lysine hypermethylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, a form of epigenetic chromatin modificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. However, whether this represents a direct sensing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> tens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> or an indirect effect, perhaps through the HIF pathway, has not been established (<i>3</i>). On pages 1222 and 1217 of this issue, Batie <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) and Chakraborty <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>), respectively, resolve this quest<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, demonstrating in different cellular systems that the activity of the lysine-specific demethylases (KDMs) KDM5A and KDM6A is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensitive, and thereby identifying them as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensors.</p>

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolyte with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents.

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair. The dynamic, reversible format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multinuclear sites from mobilized single atoms represents a distinct phenomenon that falls outside the convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al boundaries of a heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> resulting in limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, they are rapidly faced with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of root growth and development have received less attent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. In this study, we show that hypoxic condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root growth direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at hypoxic condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an auxin gradient across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the root tip.</p>

Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species

Densitometry and visual inspect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. decreased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the light (due to the effects of perturbat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> on photosynthesis and respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>) and increased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> on respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> alone). Colonies of <i>P. parrini</i>, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> metabolism. When migrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed decreased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the light and increased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> uptake in the dark, while colonies of <i>P. parrini</i> maintained the former and increased the latter. During symb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>t migrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>t type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ts in the stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P)H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Symb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>t migrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> thus correlates with dramatic physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other monatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for proton channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

Late inception of a resiliently oxygenated upper ocean

Aqueous Au-Pd colloids catalyze selective CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation to CH<sub>3</sub>OH with O<sub>2</sub> under mild conditions
<p>The selective oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of methane, the primary component of natural gas, remains an important challenge in catalysis. We used colloidal gold-palladium nanoparticles, rather than the same nanoparticles supported on titanium oxide, to oxidize methane to methanol with high selectivity (92%) in aqueous solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at mild temperatures. Then, using isotopically labeled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> (O<sub>2</sub>) as an oxidant in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>,</sub> we demonstrated that the resulting methanol incorporated a substantial fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (70%) of gas-phase O<sub>2</sub>. More <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ated products were formed than the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> consumed, suggesting that the controlled breakdown of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activates methane, which subsequently incorporates molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> through a radical process. If a source of methyl radicals can be established, then the selective oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of methane to methanol using molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> is possible.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Liverwort, <i>Marchantia</i>, Drives Alternative Electron Flow Using a Flavodiiron Protein to Protect PSI
<p>The diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in the atmosphere, like that of CO<sub>2</sub>, is approximately 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than that in aqueous environments. Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential oxidative damage. The liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, a basal land plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the atmosphere. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, <i>M. polymorpha</i> has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent alternative electron flow (AEF) to suppress the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of photosynthesis in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>) sustained photooxidative damage to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> showed the same photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> rate but a lower electron transport rate during the induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> phase of photosynthesis. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally, the react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> center chlorophyll in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of <i>MpFlv1</i> drives AEF to oxidize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and suppress electron transport in the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub>/<i>f</i> complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.</p>

Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives

Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and fur seals) regulate heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) while diving. We investigated dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in five adult female California sea l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> (number of beats/durat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>; 50±9 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min<sup>−1</sup>), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> below resting (<54 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) at some point during the dive. Both dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and minimum instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> significantly decreased with increasing dive durat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Typical instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> resulting in the lowest instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min<sup>−1</sup> in dives longer than 6 min in durat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>; (2) a slight increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> to ~10–40 beats min<sup>−1</sup> during the bottom port<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in deep-diving sea l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store, (c) conserve the blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store and (d) help limit the absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nitrogen at depth. This <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profile during deep dives of sea l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> as similar <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Hypoxia induces rapid changes to histone methylation and reprograms chromatin

A subclass of molecular di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ases is the histone demethylase enzymes, which are characterized by the presence of a Jumanji-C (JmjC) domain. Hypoxia can alter chromatin, but whether this is a direct effect on JmjC-histone demethylases or due to other mechanisms is unknown. Here, we report that hypoxia induces a rapid and hypoxia-inducible factor–independent induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of histone methylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in a range of human cultured cells.

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits

We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility.

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental quest<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by using extensive laboratory measurements of rates of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and a comparison with atmospheric observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s show that nearly all nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to sulfuric acid. A considerable fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, but the relatively weak dependence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s indicates that for the processes studied, variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the present-day atmosphere.</p>

Archaeal (Per)Chlorate Reduction at High Temperature: An Interplay of Biotic and Abiotic Reactions
<sec><title>Archaea Powered by Rocket Fuel</title><p>Perchlorate is a ubiquitous chlorine-based compound that forms naturally in the atmosphere. It is only present in large deposits in a few locat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, such as the Atacama Desert in Chile, which has been assumed to be because perchlorate-reducing bacteria normally degrade it into chloride and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>. <bold>Liebensteiner <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 85; see the Perspective by <bold>Nerenberg</bold>), however, found that an archeon, <i>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</i>, can also reduce perchlorate. The archaeal perchlorate reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathway shares limited similarity with bacterial perchlorate reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>: Instead of producing chloride and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, enzymatically produced chlorite reacts with sulfide to produce oxidized sulfur compounds. Because hyperthermophilic anaerobic archaea similar to <i>A. fulgidus</i> are thought to have been among the first complex organisms to evolve on Earth, they may have started creating oxidized condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in some habitats before the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-generating photosynthesis.</p></sec>

Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p>Flooding is detrimental for nearly all higher plants, including crops. The compound stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light levels under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to plant death. The endogenous concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of four gaseous compounds, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and nitric oxide, change during the submergence of plant organs in water. These gases play a pivotal role in signal transduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> cascades, leading to adaptive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these gases, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early flooding stress, most likely in tight interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with the other gases. The product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS) in plant cells during flooding and directly after subsidence, during which the plant is confronted with high light and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> levels, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled levels of ROS are essential for adaptive signaling pathways, in interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with the other gaseous flooding signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for plants. Therefore, a fine-tuned balance is important, with a major role for ROS product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and scavenging. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four gases and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing flooding condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and subsequent adaptive responses.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy convers<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insert<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth retardat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> observed in these condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong select<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at different time scales, we considered the interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and relaxat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> consumpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> consumpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> or face an allocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> current induced by muscarinic stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and distinct current–voltage relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with K<sup>+</sup>-free solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Molecular and functional characterization of hemocyanin of the giant African millipede, <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i>
<p>In contrast to other terrestrial arthropods, where gaseous O<sub>2</sub> that fuels aerobic metabolism diffuses to the tissues in tracheal tubes, and most other metazoans, where O<sub>2</sub> is transported to tissues by circulating respiratory proteins, the myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) strikingly have tracheal systems as well as circulating hemocyanin (Hc). In order to elucidate the evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary origin and biological significance of millipede Hc, we report the molecular structure (subunit composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and amino acid sequence) of multimeric (36-mer) Hc from the forest floor-dwelling giant African millipede <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> and its allosteric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-binding properties under various physico-chemical condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc consists of only a single subunit type with differential glycosylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Phylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc binds O<sub>2</sub> with a high affinity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O<sub>2</sub> binding is, moreover, modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, which increase the O<sub>2</sub> affinity of the Hc in the tense (T; de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ated) as well as the relaxed (R; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ated) states, and by (<sc>l</sc>)-lactate, which modulates Hc–O<sub>2</sub> affinity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, <i>L</i>. Cooperativity in O<sub>2</sub> binding at half O<sub>2</sub> saturat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>n</i><sub>50</sub>) is pH dependent and maximal at ~pH 7.4, and the number of interacting O<sub>2</sub>-binding sites (<i>q</i>) is markedly increased by binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The data are discussed in the light of the mutually supplementary roles of Hc and the tracheal system for tissue O<sub>2</sub> supply.</p>

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases.

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> and excess excitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to transfer their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing carotenoid transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

Histone Deacetylase Is Required for GA-Induced Programmed Cell Death in Maize Aleurone Layers
<p>Recent discoveries have shown that epigenetic regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is an integral part of phytohormone-mediated processes. The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) triggers a series of events in cereal aleurone cells that lead to programmed cell death (PCD), but the signaling cascade mediating GA-induced PCD in cereal aleurone layers remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity gradually increased relative to histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, leading to a global decrease in histone H3 and H4 acetylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels during PCD of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) embryoless aleurone layers after 3 d of treatment with GA. HDAC inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> prevented GA-induced PCD in embryoless aleurone cells, whereas HAT inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> resulted in PCD even in the absence of GA. Hydrogen peroxide concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s increased in GA- or HAT inhibitor-treated aleurone cells due to reduced levels of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species scavengers. Hydrogen peroxide-treated aleurone cells showed no changes in the activity or express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of HATs and HDACs. We show that it is possible to predict whether epigenetic modificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> enzymes serve as a regulator of the GA-triggered PCD signaling pathway in maize aleurone layers. Taken together, these findings reveal that HDAC activity is required for GA-induced PCD in maize aleurone layers and regulates PCD via the reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species-mediated signal transduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathway.</p>

The Membrane Transport System of the Guard Cell and Its Integration for Stomatal Dynamics
<p>Stomatal guard cells are widely recognized as the premier plant cell model for membrane transport, signaling, and homeostasis. This recognit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is rooted in half a century of research into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport across the plasma and vacuolar membranes of guard cells that drive stomatal movements and the signaling mechanisms that regulate them. Stomatal guard cells surround pores in the epidermis of plant leaves, controlling the aperture of the pore to balance CO<sub>2</sub> entry into the leaf for photosynthesis with water loss via transpirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of guard cells in the epidermis is ideally suited for cellular and subcellular research, and their sensitivity to endogenous signals and environmental stimuli makes them a primary target for physiological studies. Stomata underpin the challenges of water availability and crop product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that are expected to unfold over the next 20 to 30 years. A quantitative understanding of how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport is integrated and controlled is key to meeting these challenges and to engineering guard cells for improved water use efficiency and agricultural yields.</p>

Temperature-Induced Remodeling of the Photosynthetic Machinery Tunes Photosynthesis in the Thermophilic Alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i>
<p>The thermophilic alga <i>C. merolae</i> thrives in extreme environments (low pH and temperature between 40°C and 56°C). In this study, we investigated the acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> process of the alga to a colder temperature (25°C). A long-term cell growth experiment revealed an extensive remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus in the first 250 h of acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, which was followed by cell growth to an even higher density than the control (grown at 42°C) cell density. Once the cells were shifted to the lower temperature, the proteins of the light-harvesting antenna were greatly down-regulated and the phycobilisome composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was altered. The amount of PSI and PSII subunits was also decreased, but the chlorophyll to photosystems ratio remained unchanged. The 25°C cells possessed a less efficient photon-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> convers<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> rate and require a 2.5 times higher light intensity to reach maximum photosynthetic efficiency. With respect to chlorophyll, however, the photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> rate of the 25°C culture was 2 times higher than the control. Quantitative proteomics revealed that acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> requires, besides remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus, also adjustment of the machinery for protein folding, degradat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and homeostasis. In summary, these remodeling processes tuned photosynthesis according to the demands placed on the system and revealed the capability of <i>C. merolae</i> to grow under a broad range of temperatures.</p>

The <i>Synechocystis</i> Manganese Exporter Mnx Is Essential for Manganese Homeostasis in Cyanobacteria
<p>The essential micronutrient manganese (Mn) funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s as redox-active cofactor in active sites of enzymes and, thus, is involved in various physiological react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Moreover, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ic photosynthetic organisms, Mn is of special importance, since it is central to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-evolving complex in photosystem II. Although Mn is an essential micronutrient, increased amounts are detrimental to the organism; thus, only a small window exists for beneficial concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Accordingly, Mn homeostasis must be carefully maintained. In contrast to the well-studied uptake mechanisms in cyanobacteria, it is largely unknown how Mn is distributed to the different compartments inside the cell. We identified a protein with so far unknown funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> as a hypothetical Mn transporter in the cyanobacterial model strain <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and named this protein Mnx for Mn exporter. The knockout mutant Δ<i>mnx</i> showed increased sensitivity toward externally supplied Mn and Mn toxicity symptoms, which could be linked to intracellular Mn accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. <sup>54</sup>Mn chase experiments demonstrated that the mutant was not able to release Mn from the internal pool. Microscopic analysis of a Mnx::yellow fluorescent protein fus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> showed that the protein resides in the thylakoid membrane. Heterologous express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>mnx</i> suppressed the Mn-sensitive phenotype of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> mutant Δ<i>pmr1</i>. Our results indicate that Mnx funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s as a thylakoid Mn transporter and is a key player in maintaining Mn homeostasis in <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. We propose that Mn export from the cytoplasm into the thylakoid lumen is crucial to prevent toxic cytoplasmic Mn accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and to ensure Mn provis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to photosystem II.</p>

Jasmonate Regulates Plant Responses to Postsubmergence Reoxygenation through Transcriptional Activation of Antioxidant Synthesis
<p>Submergence induces hypoxia in plants; exposure to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> following submergence, termed re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, produces a burst of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species. The mechanisms of hypoxia sensing and signaling in plants have been well studied, but how plants respond to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> remains unclear. Here, we show that re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) involves rapid accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of jasmonates (JAs) and increased transcript levels of JA biosynthesis genes. Applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of exogenous methyl jasmonate improved tolerance to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in wild-type Arabidopsis; also, mutants deficient in JA biosynthesis and signaling were very sensitive to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Moreover, overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor gene <i>MYC2</i> enhanced tolerance to posthypoxic stress, and <i>myc2</i> knockout mutants showed increased sensitivity to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, indicating that MYC2 funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s as a key regulator in the JA-mediated re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> response. MYC2 transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally activates members of the <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE</i> (<i>VTC</i>) and <i>GLUTATH<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>E SYNTHETASE</i> (<i>GSH</i>) gene families, which encode rate-limiting enzymes in the ascorbate and glutath<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>e synthesis pathways. Overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>VTC1</i> and <i>GSH1</i> in the <i>myc2-2</i> mutant suppressed the posthypoxic hypersensitive phenotype.

Control of Autophagy in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Is Mediated through Redox-Dependent Inactivation of the ATG4 Protease<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Autophagy is a major catabolic pathway by which eukaryotic cells deliver unnecessary or damaged cytoplasmic material to the vacuole for its degradat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and recycling in order to maintain cellular homeostasis. Control of autophagy has been associated with the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species in several organisms, including plants and algae, but the precise regulatory molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the ATG4 protease, an essential protein for autophagosome biogenesis, plays a central role for the redox regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of autophagy in the model green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Our results indicate that the activity of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> ATG4 is regulated by the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a single disulfide bond with a low redox potential that can be efficiently reduced by the NADPH/thioredoxin system. Moreover, we found that treatment of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cells with norflurazon, an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis that generates reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species and triggers autophagy in this alga, promotes the oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and aggregat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of ATG4. We propose that the activity of the ATG4 protease is finely regulated by the intracellular redox state, and it is inhibited under stress condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to ensure lipidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of ATG8 and thus autophagy progress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>.</p>

Cell-Type-Specific H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity in Root Tissues Enables K<sup>+</sup> Retention and Mediates Acclimation of Barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to Salinity Stress
<p>While the importance of cell type specificity in plant adaptive responses is widely accepted, only a limited number of studies have addressed this issue at the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al level. We have combined electrophysiological, imaging, and biochemical techniques to reveal the physiological mechanisms conferring higher sensitivity of apical root cells to salinity in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). We show that salinity applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to the root apex arrests root growth in a highly tissue- and treatment-specific manner. Although salinity-induced transient net Na<sup>+</sup> uptake was about 4-fold higher in the root apex compared with the mature zone, mature root cells accumulated more cytosolic and vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that the higher sensitivity of apical cells to salt is not related to either enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> exclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> or sequestrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> inside the root. Rather, the above differential sensitivity between the two zones originates from a 10-fold difference in K<sup>+</sup> efflux between the mature zone and the apical reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (much poorer in the root apex) of the root. Major factors contributing to this poor K<sup>+</sup> retent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> ability are (1) an intrinsically lower H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in the root apex, (2) greater salt-induced membrane depolarizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and (3) a higher reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> under NaCl and a larger density of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species-activated cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> currents in the apex. Salinity treatment increased (2- to 5-fold) the content of 10 (out of 25 detected) amino acids in the root apex but not in the mature zone and changed the organic acid and sugar contents. The causal link between the observed changes in the root metabolic profile and the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of transporter activity is discussed.</p>

Oxidation of P700 in Photosystem I Is Essential for the Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>The photoinhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of photosystem I (PSI) is lethal to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ic phototrophs. Nevertheless, it is unclear how photodamage occurs or how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ic phototrophs prevent it. Here, we provide evidence that keeping P700 (the react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> center chlorophyll in PSI) oxidized protects PSI. Previous studies have suggested that PSI photoinhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> does not occur in the two model cyanobacteria, <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942, when photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was suppressed under low CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure even in mutants deficient in flavodiiron protein (FLV), which mediates alternative electron flow. The lack of FLV in <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 (S. 7002), however, is linked directly to reduced growth and PSI photodamage under CO<sub>2</sub>-limiting condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Unlike <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>S. elongatus</i> PCC 7942, S. 7002 reduced P700 during CO<sub>2</sub>-limited illuminat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the absence of FLV, resulting in decreases in both PSI and photosynthetic activities. Even at normal air CO<sub>2</sub> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, the growth of S. 7002 mutant was retarded relative to that of the wild type. Therefore, P700 oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is essential for protecting PSI against photoinhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Here, we present various strategies to alleviate PSI photoinhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in cyanobacteria.</p>

Phytoglobins Improve Hypoxic Root Growth by Alleviating Apical Meristem Cell Death
<p>Hypoxic root growth in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is influenced by the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of phytoglobins (<i>ZmPgbs</i>). Relative to the wild type, suppress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>ZmPgb1.1</i> or <i>ZmPgb1.2</i> inhibits the growth of roots exposed to 4% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, causing structural abnormalities in the root apical meristems. These effects were accompanied by increasing levels of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS), possibly through the transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of four <i>Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs</i>. TUNEL-positive nuclei in meristematic cells indicated the involvement of programmed cell death (PCD) in the process. These cells also accumulated nitric oxide and stained heavily for ethylene biosynthetic transcripts. A sharp increase in the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> level of several 1-aminocyclopropane synthase (<i>ZmAcs2</i>, <i>ZmAcs6</i>, and <i>ZmAcs7</i>), 1-aminocyclopropane oxidase (<i>Aco15</i>, <i>Aco20</i>, <i>Aco31</i>, and <i>Aco35</i>), and ethylene-responsive (<i>ZmErf2</i> and <i>ZmEbf1</i>) genes was observed in hypoxic <i>ZmPgb</i>-suppressing roots, which overproduced ethylene. Inhibiting ROS synthesis with diphenyleneiodonium or ethylene percept<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with 1-methylcyclopropene suppressed PCD, increased <i>BAX inhibitor-1</i>, an effective attenuator of the death programs in eukaryotes, and restored root growth. Hypoxic roots overexpressing <i>ZmPgbs</i> had the lowest level of ethylene and showed a reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in ROS staining and TUNEL-positive nuclei in the meristematic cells. These roots retained funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al meristems and exhibited the highest growth performance when subjected to hypoxic condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Collectively, these results suggest a novel funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Pgbs in protecting root apical meristems from hypoxia-induced PCD through mechanisms initiated by nitric oxide and mediated by ethylene via ROS.</p>

A NAC Transcription Factor Represses Putrescine Biosynthesis and Affects Drought Tolerance
<p>Arginine decarboxylase (ADC)-mediated putrescine biosynthesis plays an important role in plant stress responses, but the transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>ADC</i> in response to abiotic stress is not well understood. We isolated a NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) domain-containing transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor, PtrNAC72, from trifoliate orange (<i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>) by yeast one-hybrid screening. PtrNAC72, localized to the nucleus, binds specifically to the promoter of <i>PtADC</i> and acts as a transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al repressor. <i>PtrNAC72</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was induced by cold, drought, and abscisic acid. <i>ADC</i> messenger RNA abundance and putrescine levels were decreased in transgenic tobacco (<i>Nicotiana nudicaulis</i>) plants overexpressing <i>PtrNAC72</i> but increased, compared with the wild type, in an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transfer DNA insert<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> mutant, <i>nac72</i>. While transgenic tobacco lines overexpressing <i>PtrNAC72</i> were more sensitive to drought, plants of the Arabidopsis <i>nac72</i> mutant exhibited enhanced drought tolerance, consistent with the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species in the tested genotypes. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, exogenous applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of putrescine to the overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> lines restored drought tolerance, while treatment with <sc>d</sc>-arginine, an ADC inhibitor, compromised the drought tolerance of <i>nac72</i>. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PtrNAC72 is a repressor of putrescine biosynthesis and may negatively regulate the drought stress response, at least in part, via the modulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of putrescine-associated reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species homeostasis.</p>

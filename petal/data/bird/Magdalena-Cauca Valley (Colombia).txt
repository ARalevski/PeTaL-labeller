Imaging of pure spin-valley diffusion current in WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures
<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials are promising for spintronic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>tronic applications because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>-polarized excitations can be generated and manipulated with circularly polarized photons and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> and spin degrees of freedom are locked by strong spin-orbital interactions. In this study we demonstrate efficient generation of a pure and locked spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> diffusion current in tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>)–tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) heterostructures without any driving electric field. We imaged the propagation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> current in real time and space by pump-probe spectroscopy. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> current in the heterostructures can live for more than 20 microseconds and propagate over 20 micrometers; both the lifetime and the diffusion length can be controlled through electrostatic gating. The high-efficiency and electric-field–free generation of a locked spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> current in TMDC heterostructures holds promise for applications in spin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> devices.</p>

A valley valve and electron beam splitter
<p>Developing alternative paradigms of electronics beyond silicon technology requires the exploration of fundamentally new physical mechanisms, such as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>-specific phenomena in hexagonal two-dimensional materials. We realize ballistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> Hall kink states in bilayer graphene and demonstrate gate-controlled current transmission in a four-kink router device. The operations of a waveguide, a valve, and a tunable electron beam splitter are demonstrated. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> valve exploits the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>-momentum locking of the kink states and reaches an on/off ratio of 8 at zero magnetic field. A magnetic field enables a full-range tunable coherent beam splitter. These results pave a path to building a scalable, coherent quantum transportation network based on the kink states.</p>

Nanoscale chiral valley-photon interface through optical spin-orbit coupling
<p>The emergence of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide materials has sparked intense activity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>tronics, as their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> information can be encoded and detected with the spin angular momentum of light. We demonstrate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>-dependent directional coupling of light using a plasmonic nanowire–tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) layers system. We show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> pseudospin in WS<sub>2</sub> couples to transverse optical spin of the same handedness with a directional coupling efficiency of 90 ± 1%. Our results provide a platform for controlling, detecting, and processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> and spin information with precise optical control at the nanoscale.</p>

Large, valley-exclusive Bloch-Siegert shift in monolayer WS<sub>2</sub>
<p>Coherent interaction with off-resonance light can be used to shift the energy levels of atoms, molecules, and solids. The dominant effect is the optical Stark shift, but there is an additional contribution from the so-called Bloch-Siegert shift that has eluded direct and exclusive observation in solids. We observed an exceptionally large Bloch-Siegert shift in monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) under infrared optical driving. By controlling the light helicity, we could confine the Bloch-Siegert shift to occur only at one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>, and the optical Stark shift at the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>, because the two effects obey opposite selection rules at different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>s. Such a large and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>-exclusive Bloch-Siegert shift allows for enhanced control over the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>tronic properties of two-dimensional materials.</p>

Nanocrystalline copper films are never flat
<p>We used scanning tunneling microscopy to study low-angle grain boundaries at the surface of nearly planar copper nanocrystalline (111) films. The presence of grain boundaries and their emergence at the film surface create <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>s composed of dissociated edge dislocations and ridges where partial dislocations have recombined. Geometric analysis and simulations indicated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>s and ridges were created by an out-of-plane grain rotation driven by reduction of grain boundary energy. These results suggest that in general, it is impossible to form flat two-dimensional nanocrystalline films of copper and other metals exhibiting small stacking fault energies and/or large elastic anisotropy, which induce a large anisotropy in the dislocation-line energy.</p>

Observation of a nematic quantum Hall liquid on the surface of bismuth
<p>Nematic quantum fluids with wave functions that break the underlying crystalline symmetry can form in interacting electronic systems. We examined the quantum Hall states that arise in high magnetic fields from anisotropic hole pockets on the Bi(111) surface. Spectroscopy performed with a scanning tunneling microscope showed that a combination of single-particle effects and many-body Coulomb interactions lift the six-fold Landau level (LL) degeneracy to form three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>-polarized quantum Hall states. We imaged the resulting anisotropic LL wave functions and found that they have a different orientation for each broken-symmetry state. The wave functions correspond to those expected from pairs of hole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>s and provide a direct spatial signature of a nematic electronic phase.</p>

A family of finite-temperature electronic phase transitions in graphene multilayers
<p>Suspended Bernal-stacked graphene multilayers up to an unexpectedly large thickness exhibit a broken-symmetry ground state whose origin remains to be understood. We show that a finite-temperature second-order phase transition occurs in multilayers whose critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) increases from 12 kelvins (K) in bilayers to 100 K in heptalayers. A comparison of the data with a phenomenological model inspired by a mean-field approach suggests that the transition is associated with the appearance of a self-consistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>- and spin-dependent staggered potential that changes sign from one layer to the next, appearing at <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> and increasing upon cooling. The systematic evolution with thickness of several measured quantities imposes constraints on any microscopic theory aiming to analyze the nature of electronic correlations in this system.</p>

Glacial lake outburst floods as drivers of fluvial erosion in the Himalaya
<p>Himalayan rivers are frequently hit by catastrophic floods that are caused by the failure of glacial lake and landslide dams; however, the dynamics and long-term impacts of such floods remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive set of observations that capture the July 2016 glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in the Bhotekoshi/Sunkoshi River of Nepal. Seismic records of the flood provide new insights into GLOF mechanics and their ability to mobilize large boulders that otherwise prevent channel erosion. Because of this boulder mobilization, GLOF impacts far exceed those of the annual summer monsoon, and GLOFs may dominate fluvial erosion and channel-hillslope coupling many tens of kilometers downstream of glaciated areas. Long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> evolution in these regions may therefore be driven by GLOF frequency and magnitude, rather than by precipitation.</p>

Tunable excitons in bilayer graphene
<p>Excitons, the bound states of an electron and a hole in a solid material, play a key role in the optical properties of insulators and semiconductors. Here, we report the observation of excitons in bilayer graphene (BLG) using photocurrent spectroscopy of high-quality BLG encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. We observed two prominent excitonic resonances with narrow line widths that are tunable from the mid-infrared to the terahertz range. These excitons obey optical selection rules distinct from those in conventional semiconductors and feature an electron pseudospin winding number of 2. An external magnetic field induces a large splitting of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> excitons, corresponding to a <i>g</i>-factor of about 20. These findings open up opportunities to explore exciton physics with pseudospin texture in electrically tunable graphene systems.</p>

Cordilleran Ice Sheet mass loss preceded climate reversals near the Pleistocene Termination
<p>The Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS) once covered an area comparable to that of Greenland. Previous geologic evidence and numerical models indicate that the ice sheet covered much of westernmost Canada as late as 12.5 thousand years ago (ka). New data indicate that substantial areas throughout westernmost Canada were ice free prior to 12.5 ka and some as early as 14.0 ka, with implications for climate dynamics and the timing of meltwater discharge to the Pacific and Arctic oceans. Early Bølling-Allerød warmth halved the mass of the CIS in as little as 500 years, causing 2.5 to 3.0 meters of sea-level rise. Dozens of cirque and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> glaciers, along with the southern margin of the CIS, advanced into recently deglaciated regions during the Bølling-Allerød and Younger Dryas.</p>

A glycerophospholipid-specific pocket in the RVFV class II fusion protein drives target membrane insertion
<p>The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, causing severe disease in humans and livestock across Africa. We determined the x-ray structure of the RVFV class II fusion protein Gc in its postfusion form and in complex with a glycerophospholipid (GPL) bound in a conserved cavity next to the fusion loop. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations further revealed a built-in motif allowing en bloc insertion of the fusion loop into membranes, making few nonpolar side-chain interactions with the aliphatic moiety and multiple polar interactions with lipid head groups upon membrane restructuring. The GPL head-group recognition pocket is conserved in the fusion proteins of other arthropod-borne viruses, such as Zika and chikungunya viruses, which have recently caused major epidemics worldwide.</p>

Surface changes on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko suggest a more active past
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft spent ~2 years orbiting comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, most of it at distances that allowed surface characterization and monitoring at submeter scales. From December 2014 to June 2016, numerous localized changes were observed, which we attribute to cometary-specific weathering, erosion, and transient events driven by exposure to sunlight and other processes. While the localized changes suggest compositional or physical heterogeneity, their scale has not resulted in substantial alterations to the comet’s landscape. This suggests that most of the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">landform</span></strong>s were created early in the comet’s current orbital configuration. They may even date from earlier if the comet had a larger volatile inventory, particularly of CO or CO<sub>2</sub> ices, or contained amorphous ice, which could have triggered activity at greater distances from the Sun.</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major mineral types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these minerals and the control that the leaf exerts over mineral deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the mineral locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the minerals, and mineral volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D mineral distribution that is preserved in different environments. The mineral distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

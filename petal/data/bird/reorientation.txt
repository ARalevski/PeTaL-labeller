Injuries to the upper extremities in polytrauma
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>To analyse the influence of upper extremity trauma on the long-term   outcome of polytraumatised patients. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 629 multiply injured patients were included in a follow-up   study at least ten years after injury (mean age 26.5 years, standard   deviation 12.4). The extent of the patients’ injury was classified   using the Injury Severity Score. Outcome was measured using the   Hannover Score for Polytrauma Outcome (HASPOC), Short Form (SF)-12, rehabilitation   duration, and employment status. Outcomes for patients with and   without a fracture of the upper extremity were compared and analysed   with regard to specific fracture regions and any additional brachial   plexus lesion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 307 multiply-injured patients with and 322 without upper   extremity injuries were included in the study. The groups with and   without upper limb injuries were similar with respect to demographic   data and injury pattern, except for midface trauma. There were no   significant differences in the long-term outcome. In patients with   brachial plexus lesions there were significantly more who were unemployed,   required greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retrain</span></strong>ing and a worse HASPOC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Injuries to the upper extremities seem to have limited effect   on long-term outcome in patients with polytrauma, as long as no   injury was caused to the brachial plexus.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:255–60.</p></sec>

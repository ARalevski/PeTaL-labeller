Pollen-Expressed Leucine-Rich Repeat Extensins Are Essential for Pollen Germination and Growth
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth, the walls of the tube provide the mechanical strength resisting turgor pressure to protect two sperm cells. Cell wall proteins may play an important role in this process. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube cell wall proteins known as leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) harbor a leucine-rich repeat domain and an extensin domain. In this study, the functions of four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed LRXs, LRX8, LRX9, LRX10, and LRX11 (LRX8–11), were characterized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>LRX8–11</i> displayed a consistent expression pattern in mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grains and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes. In a phenotypic analysis of four single mutants, six double mutants, four triple mutants, and a quadruple mutant, the triple and quadruple mutant plants displayed markedly reduced seed set and decreased male transmission efficiency accompanied by compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth. GFP-fused LRX8, LRX10, and LRX11 were found to be localized to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube cell walls. An immunohistochemical analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube cell wall polysaccharides showed an increase in the amount of rhamnogalacturonan I in the subapical walls of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes of the <i>lrx9 lrx10 lrx11</i> and <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutants and a decrease in the content of fucosylated xyloglucans in <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> compared with wild-type plants. Moreover, the callose content in the apical walls of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes increased in the <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutant. In conclusion, we propose that LRX8–11 function synergistically to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube cell wall integrity; thus, they play critical roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth.</p>

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in angiosperms, rapid tip growth in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube plays a crucial role in this polarized process. However, the mechanism underlying the polarity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-organizing protein, Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth by modulating the polarity and distribution of the F-actin array. The rice <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth and a decreased germination rate of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes display a disorganized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin polarity during tip growth. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube, which is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth and polarity as well as F-actin organization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth via modulating F-actin organization and array orientation in rice. This work provides insights into tip-focused cell growth and polarity.</p>

Cytological and Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Important Roles of <i>CLE19</i> in Pollen Exine Formation
<p>The CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE) peptide signals are required for cell-cell communication in several plant growth and developmental processes. However, little is known regarding the possible functions of the CLEs in the anther. Here, we show that a T-DNA insertional mutant, and dominant-negative (DN) and overexpression (OX) transgenic plants of the <i>CLE19</i> gene, exhibited significantly reduced anther size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grain number and abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Interestingly, the <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grains showed a more extensively covered surface, but <i>CLE19-OX</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine exhibited clearly missing connections in the network and lacked separation between areas that normally form the lacunae. With a combination of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical, genetic, and transcriptomic analyses on <i>cle19</i>, <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i>, and <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants, we demonstrated that <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants produced highly vacuolated and swollen <i>aborted microspores</i> (<i>ams</i>)-like tapetal cells, lacked lipidic tapetosomes and elaioplasts, and had abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> primexine without obvious accumulation of sporo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>in precursors. Moreover, <i>CLE19</i> is important for the normal expression of more than 1,000 genes, including the transcription factor gene <i>AMS</i>, 280 <i>AMS</i>-downstream genes, and other genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> coat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine formation, lipid metabolism, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination, and hormone metabolism. In addition, the <i>DN-CLE19(+/+) ams(−/−)</i> plants exhibited the <i>ams</i> anther phenotype and <i>ams(+/−)</i> partially suppressed the <i>DN-CLE19</i> transgene-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine defects. These findings demonstrate that the proper amount of CLE19 signal is essential for the normal expression of <i>AMS</i> and its downstream gene networks in the regulation of anther development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine formation.</p>

SIPP, a Novel Mitochondrial Phosphate Carrier, Mediates in Self-Incompatibility
<p>In Solanaceae, the <i>S</i>-specific interaction between the pistil S-RNase and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <i>S</i>-Locus F-box protein controls self-incompatibility (SI). Although this interaction defines the specificity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> rejection response, the identification of three pistil essential modifier genes unlinked to the <i>S</i>-locus (<i>HT-B</i>, <i>120K</i>, and <i>NaStEP</i>) unveils a higher degree of complexity in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> rejection pathway. We showed previously that NaStEP, a stigma protein with homology with Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, is essential to SI in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. During pollination, NaStEP is taken up by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes, where potential interactions with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube proteins might underlie its function. Here, we identified NaSIPP, a mitochondrial protein with phosphate transporter activity, as a novel NaStEP-interacting protein. Coexpression of NaStEP and NaSIPP in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes showed interaction in the mitochondria, although when expressed alone, NaStEP remains mostly cytosolic, implicating NaSIPP-mediated translocation of NaStEP into the organelle. The <i>NaSIPP</i> transcript is detected specifically in mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> of <i>Nicotiana</i> spp.; however, in self-compatible plants, this gene has accumulated mutations, so its coding region is unlikely to produce a functional protein. RNA interference suppression of NaSIPP in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grains disrupts the SI by preventing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube inhibition. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model whereby the NaStEP and NaSIPP interaction, in incompatible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes, might destabilize the mitochondria and contribute to arrest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth.</p>

SMALL AUXIN UP RNA62/75 Are Required for the Translation of Transcripts Essential for Pollen Tube Growth
<p>Successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube elongation is critical for double fertilization, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube genes and the regulatory machinery underlying this crucial process are largely unknown. A previous translatomic study revealed two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAUR</i> (<i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i>) genes, <i>SAUR62</i> and <i>SAUR75</i>, whose expression is up-regulated by pollination. Here, we found that both SAUR62 and SAUR75 localized mainly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube nuclei. The siliques of homozygous <i>saur62</i> (<i>saur62/−</i>), <i>saur75</i> (<i>saur75/−</i>), and the <i>SAUR62</i>/<i>75</i> RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown line had many aborted seeds. These lines had normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> viability but defective in vitro and in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth, with branching phenotypes. Immunoprecipitation with transgenic SAUR62/75-GFP flowers revealed ribosomal protein RPL12 family members as potential interacting partners, and their individual interactions were confirmed further by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Polysome profiling showed reduced 80S ribosome abundance in homozygous <i>saur62</i>, <i>saur75</i>, <i>ribosomal large subunit12c</i>, and <i>SAUR62/75</i> RNAi flowers, suggesting that SAUR62/75 play roles in ribosome assembly. To clarify their roles in translation, we analyzed total proteins from RNAi versus wild-type flowers by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, revealing significantly reduced expression of factors participating in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube wall biogenesis and F-actin dynamics, which are critical for the elastic properties of tube elongation. Indeed, RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes showed mislocalization of deesterified and esterified pectins and F-actin organization. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical roles of SAUR62/75 and their RPL12 partners are critical in ribosomal pre-60S subunit assembly for efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube elongation and subsequent fertilization.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>VAC14</i> Is Critical for Pollen Development through Mediating Vacuolar Organization
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> viability depends on dynamic vacuolar changes during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development involving increases and decreases of vacuolar volume through water and osmolite accumulation and vacuolar fission. Mutations in <i>FAB1A</i> to <i>FAB1D</i>, the genes encoding phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>]-converting kinases, are male gametophyte lethal in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) due to defective vacuolar fission after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> mitosis I, suggesting a key role of the phospholipid in dynamic vacuolar organization. However, other genetic components that regulate the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and its involvement in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination and tube growth are unknown. Here, we identified and characterized Arabidopsis VAC14, a homolog of the yeast and metazoan VAC14s that are crucial for the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. <i>VAC14</i> is constitutively expressed and highly present in developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>. Loss of function of <i>VAC14</i> was male gametophyte lethal due to defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development. Ultrastructural studies showed that vacuolar fission after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> mitosis I was compromised in <i>vac14</i> mutant microspores, which led to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> abortion. We further showed that inhibiting the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> or exogenous application of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> mimicked or rescued the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> developmental defect of the <i>vac14</i> mutant, respectively. Genetic interference and pharmacological approaches suggested a role of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination and tube growth. Our results provide insights into the function of VAC14 and, by inference, that of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in plant cells.</p>

A Putative Protein <i>O</i>-Fucosyltransferase Facilitates Pollen Tube Penetration through the Stigma<i>–</i>Style Interface
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-pistil interactions in angiosperms, the male gametophyte (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>) germinates to produce a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube. To fertilize ovules located within the female pistil, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube must physically penetrate specialized tissues. Whereas the process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube penetration through the pistil has been anatomically well described, the genetic regulation remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gene, <i>O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>AtOFT1</i>), which plays a key role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube penetration through the stigma-style interface. Semi-in vivo growth assays demonstrate that <i>oft1</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes have a reduced ability to penetrate the stigma-style interface, leading to a nearly 2,000-fold decrease in <i>oft1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> transmission efficiency and a 5- to 10-fold decreased seed set. We also demonstrate that AtOFT1 is localized to the Golgi apparatus, indicating its potential role in cellular glycosylation events. Finally, we demonstrate that <i>AtOFT1</i> and other similar Arabidopsis genes represent a novel clade of sequences related to metazoan protein <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferases and that mutation of residues that are important for <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferase activity compromises AtOFT1 function in vivo. The results of this study elucidate a physiological function for AtOFT1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube penetration through the stigma-style interface and highlight the potential importance of protein <i>O</i>-glycosylation events in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-pistil interactions.</p>

EXO70C2 Is a Key Regulatory Factor for Optimal Tip Growth of Pollen
<p>The exocyst, a eukaryotic tethering complex, coregulates targeted exocytosis as an effector of small GTPases in polarized cell growth. In land plants, several exocyst subunits are encoded by double or triple paralogs, culminating in tens of EXO70 paralogs. Out of 23 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> EXO70 isoforms, we analyzed seven isoforms expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>. Genetic and microscopic analyses of single mutants in <i>EXO70A2</i>, <i>EXO70C1</i>, <i>EXO70C2</i>, <i>EXO70F1</i>, <i>EXO70H3</i>, <i>EXO70H5</i>, and <i>EXO70H6</i> genes revealed that only a loss-of-function <i>EXO70C2</i> allele resulted in a significant male-specific transmission defect (segregation 40%:51%:9%) due to aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth. Mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes grown in vitro exhibited an enhanced growth rate and a decreased thickness of the tip cell wall, causing tip bursts. However, <i>exo70C2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes could frequently recover and restart their speedy elongation, resulting in a repetitive stop-and-go growth dynamics. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-specific depletion of the closest paralog, <i>EXO70C1</i>, using artificial microRNA in the <i>exo70C2</i> mutant background, resulted in a complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-specific transmission defect, suggesting redundant functions of EXO70C1 and EXO70C2. Both EXO70C1 and EXO70C2, GFP tagged and expressed under the control of their native promoters, localized in the cytoplasm of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grains, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes, and also root trichoblast cells. The expression of EXO70C2-GFP complemented the aberrant growth of <i>exo70C2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes. The absent EXO70C2 interactions with core exocyst subunits in the yeast two-hybrid assay, cytoplasmic localization, and genetic effect suggest an unconventional EXO70 function possibly as a regulator of exocytosis outside the exocyst complex. In conclusion, EXO70C2 is a novel factor contributing to the regulation of optimal tip growth of Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes.</p>

Metabolic Control of Tobacco Pollination by Sugars and Invertases
<p>Pollination in flowering plants is initiated by germination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grains on stigmas followed by fast growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes representing highly energy-consuming processes. The symplastic isolation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grains and tubes requires import of Suc available in the apoplast. We show that the functional coupling of Suc cleavage by invertases and uptake of the released hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollination in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolocalization of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo support the functional coupling in supplying carbohydrates for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination and tube growth evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated expression. Detection of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk between male and female tissues and supported the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollination. Tissue-specific expression of an invertase inhibitor and addition of the chemical invertase inhibitor miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously available Suc into the germinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after cleavage by extracellular invertase. Reduction of extracellular invertase activity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination, whereas Suc is supporting tube growth, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulation of pollination by carbohydrates.</p>

Gametophytic Pollen Tube Guidance: Attractant Peptides, Gametic Controls, and Receptors
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube guidance in flowering plants is a unique and critical process for successful sexual reproduction. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube that grows from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>, which is the male gametophyte, precisely navigates to the embryo sac, which is the female gametophyte, within the pistil. Recent advances have clarified the molecular framework of gametophytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube guidance. Multiple species-specific attractant peptides are secreted from synergid cells, the proper development and function of which are regulated by female gametes. Multiple receptor-like kinases on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube tip are involved in sensing species-specific attractant peptides. In this Update article, recent progress in our understanding of the mechanism of gametophytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube guidance is reviewed, including attraction by synergid cells, control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube guidance by female gametes, and directional growth of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube by directional cue sensing.

Dynamics of the Pollen Sequestrome Defined by Subcellular Coupled Omics
<p>Reproduction success in angiosperm plants depends on robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth through the female pistil tissues to ensure successful fertilization. Accordingly, there is an apparent evolutionary trend to accumulate significant reserves during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> maturation, including a population of stored mRNAs, that are utilized later for a massive translation of various proteins in growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes. Here, we performed a thorough transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of stored and translated transcripts in three subcellular compartments of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), long-term storage EDTA/puromycin-resistant particles, translating polysomes, and free ribonuclear particles, throughout tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development and in in vitro-growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes. We demonstrated that the composition of the aforementioned complexes is not rigid and that numerous transcripts were redistributed among these complexes during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development, which may represent an important mechanism of translational regulation. Therefore, we defined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> sequestrome as a distinct and highly dynamic compartment for the storage of stable, translationally repressed transcripts and demonstrated its dynamics. We propose that EDTA/puromycin-resistant particle complexes represent aggregated nontranslating monosomes as the primary mediators of messenger RNA sequestration. Such organization is extremely useful in fast tip-growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes, where rapid and orchestrated protein synthesis must take place in specific regions.</p>

The ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 Complex Mediates Pollen Tube Growth by Coordinating Vacuolar Targeting and Organization
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth is an essential step for successful plant reproduction. Vacuolar trafficking and dynamic organization are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth; however, the key proteins involved in these processes are not well understood. Here, we report that the ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 (AP-3) complex and its tonoplast cargo PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10) are critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). AP-3 is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of four subunits, δ, β, µ, and σ. AP-3 regulates tonoplast targeting of several cargoes, such as PAT10. We show that functional loss of any of the four AP-3 subunits reduces plant fertility. In <i>ap-3</i> mutants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development was normal but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth was compromised, leading to reduced male transmission. Functional loss of <i>PAT10</i> caused a similar reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth, suggesting that the tonoplast association of PAT10 mediated by AP-3 is crucial for this process. Indeed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth was reduced significantly due to <i>AP-3</i> loss of function, consistent with the abnormal targeting of CALCINUERIN B-LIKE2 (CBL2) and CBL3, whose tonoplast association depends on PAT10. Furthermore, we show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes of <i>ap-3</i> mutants have vacuoles with simplified tubules and bulbous structures, indicating that AP-3 affects vacuolar organization. Our results demonstrate a role for AP-3 in plant reproduction and provide insights into the role of vacuoles in polarized cell growth.</p>

MAP Kinase PrMPK9-1 Contributes to the Self-Incompatibility Response
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) form important signaling modules for a variety of cellular responses in eukaryotic cells. In plants, MAPKs play key roles in growth and development as well as in immunity/stress responses. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-pistil interactions are critical early events regulating pollination and fertilization and involve many signaling events. Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism to prevent self-fertilization and inbreeding in higher plants and also is known to utilize signaling to achieve incompatible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> rejection. Although several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed MAPKs exist, very little is known about their function. We previously identified a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed MAPK (p56) from <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> that was rapidly activated during SI; several studies implicated its role in signaling to SI-induced programmed cell death involving a DEVDase. However, to date, the identity of the MAPK involved has been unknown. Here, we have identified and cloned a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed <i>P. rhoeas</i> threonine-aspartate-tyrosine (TDY) MAPK, <i>PrMPK9-1</i>. Rather few data relating to the function of TDY MAPKs in plants currently exist. We provide evidence that <i>PrMPK9-1</i> has a cell type-specific function, with a distinct role from <i>AtMPK9</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first study implicating a function for a TDY MAPK in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>. We show that PrMPK9-1 corresponds to p56 and demonstrate that it is functionally involved in mediating SI in <i>P. rhoeas</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>: PrMPK9-1 is a key regulator for SI in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> and acts upstream of programmed cell death involving actin and activation of a DEVDase. Our study provides an important advance in elucidating functional roles for this class of MAPKs.</p>

<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall protects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grains from abiotic and biotic stresses. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall development, tapetal cells play a vital role by secreting proteins, signals, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall material to ensure microspore development. But the regulatory mechanism underlying the secretory pathway of the tapetum is largely unknown. Here, we characterize the essential role of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) COPII protein SECRETORY31B (SEC31B) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall development and the secretory activity of tapetal cells. The sporophyte-controlled <i>atsec31b</i> mutant exhibits severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> and seed abortion. Transmission electron microscopy observation indicates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine formation in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant is disrupted significantly. AtSEC31B is a functional COPII protein revealed by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit site localization, interaction with AtSEC13A, and retarded ER-Golgi protein trafficking in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant. A genetic tapetum-specific rescue assay indicates that AtSEC31B functions primarily in the tapetum. Moreover, deletion of AtSEC31B interrupted the formation of the ER-derived tapetosome and altered the location of the ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER9 protein in the tapetum. Therefore, this work demonstrates that AtSEC31B plays a vital role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall development by regulating the secretory pathway of the tapetal cells.</p>

Cysteine-rich peptides promote interspecific genetic isolation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Reproductive isolation is a prerequisite for speciation. Failure of communication between female tissues of the pistil and paternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes imposes hybridization barriers in flowering plants. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> LURE1 (AtLURE1) peptides and their male receptor PRK6 aid attraction of the growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube to the ovule. Here, we report that the knockout of the entire <i>AtLURE1</i> gene family did not affect fertility, indicating that AtLURE1-PRK6–mediated signaling is not required for successful fertilization within one <i>Arabidopsis</i> species. AtLURE1s instead function as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube emergence accelerators that favor conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> from other species and thus promote reproductive isolation. We also identified maternal peptides XIUQIU1 to -4, which attract <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes regardless of species. Cooperation between ovule attraction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth acceleration favors conspecific fertilization and promotes reproductive isolation.</p>

<i>Arabidopsis</i> pollen tube integrity and sperm release are regulated by RALF-mediated signaling
<p>In flowering plants, fertilization requires complex cell-to-cell communication events between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube and the female reproductive tissues, which are controlled by extracellular signaling molecules interacting with receptors at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube surface. We found that two such receptors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, BUPS1 and BUPS2, and their peptide ligands, RALF4 and RALF19, are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube–expressed and are required to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube integrity. BUPS1 and BUPS2 interact with receptors ANXUR1 and ANXUR2 via their ectodomains, and both sets of receptors bind RALF4 and RALF19. These receptor-ligand interactions are in competition with the female-derived ligand RALF34, which induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube bursting at nanomolar concentrations. We propose that RALF34 replaces RALF4 and RALF19 at the interface of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube–female gametophyte contact, thereby deregulating BUPS-ANXUR signaling and in turn leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube rupture and sperm release.</p>

3D Imaging of Tapetal Mitochondria Suggests the Importance of Mitochondrial Fission in Pollen Growth
<p>Mitochondrial fission occurs frequently in plant cells, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical significance is poorly understood because mutants specifically impaired in mitochondrial fission do not show obvious defects in vegetative growth. Here, we revealed that the production of viable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> was reduced in mutants lacking one of the three main proteins involved in mitochondrial fission in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3A (DRP3A)/Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-LIKE PROTEIN2A, DRP3B, and ELONGATED MITOCHONDRIA1 (ELM1). In <i>drp3b</i> and <i>elm1</i>, young microspores contained an abnormal number of nuclei, and mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> had aberrant accumulation of lipids in their coat and an irregular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> outer wall. Because the formation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall and coat is mainly associated with tapetal function, we used 3D imaging to quantify geometric and textural features of cells and mitochondria in the tapetum at different stages, using isolated single tapetal cells in which the in vivo morphology and volume of cells and mitochondria were preserved. Tapetal cells and their mitochondria changed in the volume and morphology at different developmental stages. Defective mitochondrial fission in the <i>elm1</i> and <i>drp3b</i> mutants caused changes in mitochondrial status, including mitochondrial elongation, abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure, a decrease in cross-sectional area, and a slight alteration of mitochondrial distribution, as well as a large reduction in mitochondrial density. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial fission is required for proper mitochondrial status in the tapetum and possibly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> as well and therefore plays an important role for the production of viable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development.</p>

Multiplex recording of cellular events over time on CRISPR biological tape
<p>Although dynamics underlie many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes, our ability to robustly and accurately profile time-varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals and regulatory programs remains limited. Here we describe a framework for storing temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical information directly in the genomes of a cell population. We developed a “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical tape recorder” in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then recorded by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable recording over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously record the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical events on a large scale.</p>

MONENSIN SENSITIVITY1 (MON1)/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-Mediated Rab7 Activation Regulates Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD)-triggered degradation of plant tapetum is essential for microspore development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> coat formation; however, little is known about the cellular mechanism regulating tapetal PCD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab7-mediated vacuolar transport of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases is crucial for tapetal PCD and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with the following evidence: (1) The <i>monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>mon1</i>) mutants, which are defective in Rab7 activation, showed impaired male fertility due to a combined defect in both tapetum and male gametophyte development. (2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> coat formation and decreased male fertility. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-mediated Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-mediated vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination and tube growth. Taken together, tapetal PCD and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development require successful MON1/CCZ1-mediated vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

IRREGULAR POLLEN EXINE1 Is a Novel Factor in Anther Cuticle and Pollen Exine Formation
<p>Anther cuticle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine are protective barriers for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development and fertilization. Despite that several regulators have been identified for anther cuticle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), few genes have been characterized in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report a novel male-sterile mutant in maize, <i>irregular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine1</i> (<i>ipe1</i>), which exhibited a glossy outer anther surface, abnormal Ubisch bodies, and defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine. Using map-based cloning, the <i>IPE1</i> gene was isolated as a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Transcripts of <i>IPE1</i> were preferentially accumulated in the tapetum during the tetrad and early uninucleate microspore stage. A biochemical assay indicated that <i>ipe1</i> anthers had altered constituents of wax and a significant reduction of cutin monomers and fatty acids. RNA sequencing data revealed that genes implicated in wax and flavonoid metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and elongation were differentially expressed in <i>ipe1</i> mutant anthers. In addition, the analysis of transfer DNA insertional lines of the orthologous gene in Arabidopsis suggested that IPE1 and their orthologs have a partially conserved function in male organ development. Our results showed that IPE1 participates in the putative oxidative pathway of C16/C18 ω-hydroxy fatty acids and controls anther cuticle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine development together with MALE STERILITY26 and MALE STERILITY45 in maize.</p>

Two Membrane-Anchored Aspartic Proteases Contribute to Pollen and Ovule Development
<p>Aspartic proteases are a class of proteolytic enzymes with conserved aspartate residues, which are implicated in protein processing, maturation, and degradation. Compared with yeast and animals, plants possess a larger aspartic protease family. However, little is known about most of these enzymes. Here, we characterized two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored aspartic protease genes, <i>A36</i> and <i>A39</i>, which are highly expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes. <i>a36</i> and <i>a36 a39</i> mutants display significantly reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> activity. Transmission electron microscopy and terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assays further revealed that the unviable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> in <i>a36 a39</i> may undergo unanticipated apoptosis-like programmed cell death. The degeneration of female gametes also occurred in <i>a36 a39</i>. Aniline Blue staining, scanning electron microscopy, and semi in vitro guidance assays indicated that the micropylar guidance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes is significantly compromised in <i>a36 a39</i>. A36 and A39 that were fused with green fluorescent protein are localized to the plasma membrane and display punctate cytosolic localization and colocalize with the GPI-anchored protein COBRA-LIKE10. Furthermore, in <i>a36 a39</i>, the abundance of highly methylesterified homogalacturonans and xyloglucans was increased significantly in the apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube wall. These results indicate that A36 and A39, two putative GPI-anchored aspartic proteases, play important roles in plant reproduction in Arabidopsis.</p>

A MYB Triad Controls Primary and Phenylpropanoid Metabolites for Pollen Coat Patterning
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall is a complex, durable structure essential for plant reproduction. A substantial portion of phenylpropanoids (e.g. flavonols) produced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grain tapetal cells are deposited in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall. Transcriptional regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall formation has been studied extensively, and a specific regulatory mechanism for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> flavonol biosynthesis has been postulated. Here, metabolome and transcriptome analyses of anthers from mutant and overexpression genotypes revealed that Arabidopsis MYB99, a putative ortholog of the petunia (<i>Petunia hybrida</i>) floral scent regulator ODORANT1 (ODO1), controls the exclusive production of tapetum diglycosylated flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid amides. We discovered that MYB99 acts in a regulatory triad with MYB21 and MYB24, orthologs of emission of benzenoids I and II, which together with ODO1 coregulate petunia scent biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, promoter-activation assays showed that MYB99 directs precursor supply from the Calvin cycle and oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway in primary metabolism to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis by controlling <i>TRANSKETOLASE2</i> expression. We provide a model depicting the relationship between the Arabidopsis MYB triad and structural genes from primary and phenylpropanoid metabolism and compare this mechanism with petunia scent control. The discovery of orthologous protein triads producing related secondary metabolites suggests that analogous regulatory modules exist in other plants and act to regulate various branches of the intricate phenylpropanoid pathway.</p>

The Mitochondrial Endonuclease M20 Participates in the Down-Regulation of Mitochondrial DNA in Pollen Cells
<p>Maintaining the appropriate number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules is crucial for supporting mitochondrial metabolism and function in both plant and animal cells. For example, a substantial decrease in mtDNA levels occurs as a key part of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development. The molecular mechanisms regulating mtDNA copy number are largely unclear, particularly with regard to those that reduce mtDNA levels. Here, we identified and purified a 20-kD endonuclease, M20, from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> mitochondria. We found M20 to be an His-Asn-His/Asn (H-N-H/N) nuclease that degrades linear and circular DNA in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtM20, which shared high sequence similarity with maize M20, localized to the mitochondria, had a similar H-N-H/N structure, and degraded both linear and circular DNA. <i>AtM20</i> transcript levels increased during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development, in parallel with a rapid reduction in mtDNA. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome-editing techniques were used to generate knockout lines of <i>AtM20</i> (<i>atm20</i>), which exhibited a significant delay in the reduction in mtDNA levels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> vegetative cells but normal mtDNA levels in somatic cells. The delayed reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> mtDNA levels was rescued by the transgenic expression of <i>AtM20</i> in <i>atm20</i> plants. This study thus uncovers an endonucleolytic DNase in plant mitochondria and its crucial role in reducing mtDNA levels, pointing to the complex mechanism regulating mtDNA levels in plants.</p>

LRX Proteins Play a Crucial Role in Pollen Grain and Pollen Tube Cell Wall Development<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Leu-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) are chimeric proteins containing an N-terminal Leu-rich repeat (LRR) and a C-terminal extensin domain. LRXs are involved in cell wall formation in vegetative tissues and required for plant growth. However, the nature of their role in these cellular processes remains to be elucidated. Here, we used a combination of molecular techniques, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to characterize mutants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed <i>LRXs</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>). Mutations in multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed <i>lrx</i> genes cause severe defects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth, resulting in a reduced seed set. Physiological experiments demonstrate that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability partially suppresses the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth defects, suggesting that LRX proteins influence Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related processes. Furthermore, we show that LRX protein localizes to the cell wall, and its LRR-domain (which likely mediates protein-protein interactions) is associated with the plasma membrane. Mechanical analyses by cellular force microscopy and finite element method-based modeling revealed significant changes in the material properties of the cell wall and the fine-tuning of cellular biophysical parameters in the mutants compared to the wild type. The results indicate that LRX proteins might play a role in cell wall-plasma membrane communication, influencing cell wall formation and cellular mechanics.</p>

SEIPIN Proteins Mediate Lipid Droplet Biogenesis to Promote Pollen Transmission and Reduce Seed Dormancy
<p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous organelles in plant cells, but their physiological roles are largely unknown. To gain insight into the function of LDs in plants, we have characterized the Arabidopsis homologs of SEIPIN proteins, which are crucial factors for LD biogenesis in yeast and animals. <i>SEIPIN1</i> is expressed almost exclusively in embryos, while <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> have broader expression profiles with maximal levels in embryos and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>, where LDs accumulate most abundantly. Genetic analysis demonstrates that all three <i>SEIPINs</i> contribute to proper LD biogenesis in embryos, whereas in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>, only <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> play a significant role. The double <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants accumulate extremely enlarged LDs in seeds and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>, which hinders their subsequent mobilization during germination. Interestingly, electron microscopy analysis reveals the presence of nuclear LDs attached to type I nucleoplasmic reticulum in triple <i>seipin</i> mutant embryos, supporting that SEIPINs are essential for maintaining the correct polarity of LD budding at the nuclear envelope, restricting it to the outer membrane. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>, the perturbations in LD biogenesis and turnover are coupled to reduced germination in vitro and with lower fertilization efficiency in vivo. In seeds, germination per se is not affected in <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants, but there is a striking increase in seed dormancy levels. Our findings reveal the relevance of SEIPIN-dependent LD biogenesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> transmission and in adjusting the timing of seed germination, two key adaptive traits of great importance in agriculture.</p>

Triphosphate Tunnel Metalloenzyme Function in Senescence Highlights a Biological Diversification of This Protein Superfamily
<p>The triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme (TTM) superfamily comprises a group of enzymes that hydrolyze organophosphate substrates. They exist in all domains of life, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical role of most family members is unclear. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes three <i>TTM</i> genes. We have previously reported that AtTTM2 displays pyrophosphatase activity and is involved in pathogen resistance. Here, we report the biochemical activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function of <i>AtTTM1</i> and diversification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical roles between <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>2</i>. Biochemical analyses revealed that AtTTM1 displays pyrophosphatase activity similar to AtTTM2, making them the only TTMs characterized so far to act on a diphosphate substrate. However, knockout mutant analysis showed that <i>AtTTM1</i> is not involved in pathogen resistance but rather in leaf senescence. <i>AtTTM1</i> is transcriptionally up-regulated during leaf senescence, and knockout mutants of <i>AtTTM1</i> exhibit delayed dark-induced and natural senescence. The double mutant of <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>AtTTM2</i> did not show synergistic effects, further indicating the diversification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function. However, promoter swap analyses revealed that they functionally can complement each other, and confocal microscopy revealed that both proteins are tail-anchored proteins that localize to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Additionally, transient overexpression of either gene in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced senescence-like cell death upon dark treatment. Taken together, we show that two TTMs display the same biochemical properties but distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions that are governed by their transcriptional regulation. Moreover, this work reveals a possible connection of immunity-related programmed cell death and senescence through novel mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins.</p>

SDG2-Mediated H3K4me3 Is Crucial for Chromatin Condensation and Mitotic Division during Male Gametogenesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming occurring during reproduction is crucial for both animal and plant development. Histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mark of transcriptional active euchromatin. While much has been learned in somatic cells, H3K4me3 deposition and function in gametophyte is poorly studied. Here, we demonstrate that SET DOMAIN GROUP2 (SDG2)-mediated H3K4me3 deposition participates in epigenetic reprogramming during Arabidopsis male gametogenesis. We show that loss of SDG2 barely affects meiosis and cell fate establishment of haploid cells. However, we found that SDG2 is critical for postmeiotic microspore development. Mitotic cell division progression is partly impaired in the loss-of-function <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant, particularly at the second mitosis setting up the two sperm cells. We demonstrate that SDG2 is involved in promoting chromatin decondensation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> vegetative nucleus, likely through its role in H3K4me3 deposition, which prevents ectopic heterochromatic H3K9me2 speckle formation. Moreover, we found that derepression of the LTR retrotransposon <i>ATLANTYS1</i> is compromised in the vegetative cell of the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>. Consistent with chromatin condensation and compromised transcription activity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube elongation, representing the key function of the vegetative cell in transporting sperm cells during fertilization, are inhibited in the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant. Taken together, we conclude that SDG2-mediated H3K4me3 is an essential epigenetic mark of the gametophyte chromatin landscape, playing critical roles in gamete mitotic cell cycle progression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> vegetative cell function during male gametogenesis and beyond.</p>

Analysis of Exocyst Subunit EXO70 Family Reveals Distinct Membrane Polar Domains in Tobacco Pollen Tubes
<p>The vesicle-tethering complex exocyst is one of the crucial cell polarity regulators. The EXO70 subunit is required for the targeting of the complex and is represented by many isoforms in angiosperm plant cells. This diversity could be partly responsible for the establishment and maintenance of membrane domains with different composition. To address this hypothesis, we employed the growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube, a well-established cell polarity model system, and performed large-scale expression, localization, and functional analysis of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) EXO70 isoforms. Various isoforms localized to different regions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube plasma membrane, apical vesicle-rich inverted cone region, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The overexpression of major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed EXO70 isoforms resulted in growth arrest and characteristic phenotypic deviations of tip swelling and apical invaginations. NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 occupied two distinct and mutually exclusive plasma membrane domains. Both isoforms partly colocalized with the exocyst subunit NtSEC3a at the plasma membrane, possibly forming different exocyst complex subpopulations. NtEXO70A1a localized to the small area previously characterized as the site of exocytosis in the tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube, while NtEXO70B1 surprisingly colocalized with the zone of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Both NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 colocalized to different degrees with markers for the anionic signaling phospholipids phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid. In contrast, members of the EXO70 C class, which are specifically expressed in tip-growing cells, exhibited exocytosis-related functional effects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes despite the absence of apparent plasma membrane localization. Taken together, our data support the existence of multiple membrane-trafficking domains regulated by different EXO70-containing exocyst complexes within a single cell.</p>

Structure-Activity Relation of AMOR Sugar Molecule That Activates Pollen-Tubes for Ovular Guidance
<p>Successful fertilization in flowering plants depends on the precise directional growth control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube through the female pistil tissue toward the female gametophyte contained in the ovule for delivery of nonmotile sperm cells. Cys-rich peptides LUREs secreted from the synergid cells on either side of the egg cell act as ovular attractants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes. Competency control by the pistil is crucial for the response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes to these ovular attractants. We recently reported that ovular 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl arabinogalactan (AMOR) induces competency of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube to respond to ovular attractant LURE peptides in <i>Torenia fournieri.</i> The beta isomer of the terminal disaccharide 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl galactose was essential and sufficient for the competency induction. However, critical and noncritical structures in the disaccharide have not been dissected deeply. Herein, we report the synthesis of new AMOR analogs and the structure-activity relationships for AMOR activity in the presence of these synthesized analogs. Removal of 4-<i>O</i>-methyl group or –COOH from the glucuronosyl residue of the disaccharide dramatically reduces AMOR activity. The pyranose backbone of the second sugar of disaccharide is essential for the activity but not hydroxy groups. The role of beta isomer of the disaccharide 4-Me-GlcA-β(1,6)-Gal is very specific for competency control, as there was no difference in effect among the sugar analogs tested for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination. This study represents the first structure-activity relationship study, to our knowledge, of a sugar molecule involved in plant reproduction, which opens a way for modification of the molecule without loss of activity.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems
<p>Mechanical power limitations emerge from the physical trade-off between force and velocity. Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems incorporate power-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small sizes. We establish how power enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own force-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical and synthetic systems. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. This analysis defines the cascading challenges of power enhancement, explores their emergent effects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical and engineered systems, and charts a pathway for higher-level analysis and synthesis of power-amplified systems.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool, which enable the interpretation of an observed transcriptomic change (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional impact for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our perception of the functional impacts of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical significance of the observed DEGs using established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA. The PAIR version 5.0-inferred interactome and GSLA Web tool both can be accessed at <ext-link>http://public.synergylab.cn/pair/</ext-link>.</p>

Stage-Specific Gene Profiling of Germinal Cells Helps Delineate the Mitosis/Meiosis Transition
<p>In flowering plants, germ lines are induced from somatic meristems within reproductive organs. Within anthers, germinal cell initials first undergo several rounds of mitotic proliferation before synchronously entering meiosis. Our understanding of the progression and the molecular basis of this mitosis to meiosis transition is still limited. Taking advantage of the correlation between anther length and premeiotic germinal cell development in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we studied the transcriptome dynamics of germinal cells at three sequential stages, mitotic archesporial cells, enlarging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> mother cells at the premeiosis interphase, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> mother cells at the early prophase of meiosis, using laser microdissection-based expression profiling. Our analysis showed that cells undergoing the mitosis-meiosis switch exhibit robust transcriptional changes. The three stages are distinguished by the expression of genes encoding transcription factor subsets, meiotic chromosome recombination proteins, and distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, respectively. The transcription level of genes encoding protein turnover machinery was significantly higher in these three stages of germinal cells than in mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>, parenchyma cells, or seedlings. Our experimental results further indicate that many meiotic genes are not only transcribed, but also translated prior to meiosis. We suggest that the enlarging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> mother cells stage represents a crucial turning point from mitosis to meiosis for developing germinal cells.</p>

Pollen Aperture Factor INP1 Acts Late in Aperture Formation by Excluding Specific Membrane Domains from Exine Deposition
<p>Accurate placement of extracellular materials is a critical part of cellular development. To study how cells achieve this accuracy, we use formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> apertures as a model. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), three regions on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> surface lack deposition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall exine and develop into apertures. In developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>, Arabidopsis <i>INAPERTURATE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>1</i> (INP1) protein acts as a marker for the preaperture domains, assembling there into three punctate lines. To understand the mechanism of aperture formation, we studied the dynamics of INP1 expression and localization and its relationship with the membrane domains at which it assembles. We found that INP1 assembly occurs after meiotic cytokinesis at the interface between the plasma membrane and the overlying callose wall, and requires the normal callose wall formation. Sites of INP1 localization coincide with positions of protruding membrane ridges in proximity to the callose wall. Our data suggest that INP1 is a late-acting factor involved in keeping specific membrane domains next to the callose wall to prevent formation of exine at these sites.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering plants, the female gametophyte controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube reception immediately before fertilization and regulates seed development immediately after fertilization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube reception by the female gametophyte before fertilization and the initiation of seed development after fertilization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the female gametophyte and in the zygote and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the developing seeds was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old seedlings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in seeds. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in seeds, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of seed development. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double fertilization and supported the model that a passage through the female gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in seeds and controls early seed development.</p>

KNS4/UPEX1: A Type II Arabinogalactan <i>β</i>-(1,3)-Galactosyltransferase Required for Pollen Exine Development
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine is essential for protection from the environment of the male gametes of seed-producing plants, but its assembly and composition remain poorly understood. We previously characterized Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) mutants with abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine structure and morphology that we named <i>kaonashi</i> (<i>kns</i>). Here we describe the identification of the causal gene of <i>kns4</i> that was found to be a member of the CAZy glycosyltransferase 31 gene family, identical to <i>UNEVEN PATTERN OF EXINE1</i>, and the biochemical characterization of the encoded protein. The characteristic exine phenotype in the <i>kns4</i> mutant is related to an abnormality of the primexine matrix laid on the surface of developing microspores. Using light microscopy with a combination of type II arabinogalactan (AG) antibodies and staining with the arabinogalactan-protein (AGP)-specific β-Glc Yariv reagent, we show that the levels of AGPs in the <i>kns4</i> microspore primexine are considerably diminished, and their location differs from that of wild type, as does the distribution of pectin labeling. Furthermore, <i>kns4</i> mutants exhibit reduced fertility as indicated by shorter fruit lengths and lower seed set compared to the wild type, confirming that KNS4 is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> viability and development. KNS4 was heterologously expressed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, and was shown to possess β-(1,3)-galactosyltransferase activity responsible for the synthesis of AG glycans that are present on both AGPs and/or the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I. These data demonstrate that defects in AGP/pectic glycans, caused by disruption of <i>KNS4</i> function, impact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development and viability in Arabidopsis.</p>

<i>Defective Pollen Wall 2</i> (<i>DPW2</i>) Encodes an Acyl Transferase Required for Rice Pollen Development
<p>Aliphatic and aromatic lipids are both essential structural components of the plant cuticle, an important interface between the plant and environment. Although cross links between aromatic and aliphatic or other moieties are known to be associated with the formation of leaf cutin and root and seed suberin, the contribution of aromatic lipids to the biosynthesis of anther cuticles and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> walls remains elusive. In this study, we characterized the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) male sterile mutant, <i>defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall 2</i> (<i>dpw2</i>), which showed an abnormal anther cuticle, a defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall, and complete male sterility. Compared with the wild type, <i>dpw2</i> anthers have increased amounts of cutin and waxes and decreased levels of lipidic and phenolic compounds. <i>DPW2</i> encodes a cytoplasmically localized BAHD acyltransferase. In vitro assays demonstrated that recombinant DPW2 specifically transfers hydroxycinnamic acid moieties, using ω-hydroxy fatty acids as acyl acceptors and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs as acyl donors. Thus, The cytoplasmic hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:ω-hydroxy fatty acid transferase DPW2 plays a fundamental role in male reproduction via the biosynthesis of key components of the anther cuticle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall.</p>

RALF4/19 peptides interact with LRX proteins to control pollen tube growth in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>The communication of changes in the extracellular matrix to the interior of the cell is crucial for a cell’s function.

We found that <i>Arabidopsis</i> RALF4 and RALF19 redundantly regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube integrity and growth, and that their function depends on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed proteins of the LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT EXTENSIN (LRX) family, which play a role in cell wall development but whose mode of action is not understood.

Arabidopsis <i>PIRL6</i> Is Essential for Male and Female Gametogenesis and Is Regulated by Alternative Splicing
<p>Plant intracellular Ras-group leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins (PIRLs) are related to Ras-interacting animal LRR proteins that participate in developmental cell signaling. Systematic knockout analysis has implicated some members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>PIRL</i> family in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development. However, for <i>PIRL6</i>, no bona fide knockout alleles have been recovered, suggesting that it may have an essential function in both male and female gametophytes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated <i>PIRL6</i> expression and induced knockdown by RNA interference. Knockdown triggered defects in gametogenesis, resulting in abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> and early developmental arrest in the embryo sac. Consistent with this, <i>PIRL6</i> was expressed in gametophytes: functional transcripts were detected in wild-type flowers but not in <i>sporocyteless</i> (<i>spl</i>) mutant flowers, which do not produce gametophytes. A genomic PIRL6-GFP fusion construct confirmed expression in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> and the embryo sac. Interestingly, <i>PIRL6</i> is part of a convergent overlapping gene pair, a scenario associated with an increased likelihood of alternative splicing. We detected multiple alternative <i>PIRL6</i> mRNAs in vegetative organs and <i>spl</i> mutant flowers, tissues that lacked the functionally spliced transcript. cDNA sequencing revealed that all contained intron sequences and premature termination codons. These alternative mRNAs accumulated in the nonsense-mediated decay mutant <i>upf3</i>, indicating that they are normally subjected to degradation. Together, these results demonstrate that <i>PIRL6</i> is required in both male and female gametogenesis and suggest that sporophytic expression is negatively regulated by unproductive alternative splicing. This posttranscriptional mechanism may function to minimize PIRL6 protein expression in sporophyte tissues while allowing the overlapping adjacent gene to remain widely transcribed.</p>

GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR Specify Meristematic Cells of Gynoecia and Anthers

There are nine <i>GRFs</i> and three <i>GIFs</i> in Arabidopsis, and seven <i>GRFs</i> are posttranscriptionally silenced by microRNA396 (miR396). We found that overexpression of <i>MIR396</i> in the <i>gif1 gif2</i> double mutant background (<i>gif1 gif2 35S</i>:<i>MIR396</i>) resulted in neither ovary nor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>. Histological and molecular marker-based analyses revealed that the mutant gynoecial primordia failed to develop carpel margin meristems and mature flowers lacked the ovary, consisting only of the stigma, style, and replum-like tissues. The mutant anther primordia were not able to form the pluripotent archesporial cells that produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> mother cells and microsporangia. Multiple combinations of <i>GRF</i> mutations also displayed the same phenotypes, indicating that the GRF-GIF duo is required for the formation of those meristematic and pluripotent cells. Most GRF proteins are localized and abundant in those cells. We also found that the weak gynoecial defects of <i>pinoid-3</i> (<i>pid-3</i>) mutants were remarkably exacerbated by <i>gif1 gif2</i> double mutations and <i>35S</i>:<i>MIR396</i>, so that none of the gynoecia produced by <i>gif1 gif2 pid-3</i> and <i>35S</i>:<i>MIR396 pid-3</i> developed ovaries at all. Moreover, <i>gif1 gif2</i> double mutations and <i>35S</i>:<i>MIR396</i> also acted synergistically with 1-<i>N</i>-naphthylphthalamic acid in forming aberrant gynoecia. The results altogether suggest that the GRF-GIF duo regulates the meristematic and pluripotent competence of carpel margin meristems and the archesporial cell lineage and that this regulation is implemented in association with auxin action, ultimately conferring reproductive competence on Arabidopsis.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Multiplexed Gene Editing and Protein Overexpression Using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> Viral Vector
<p>Development of CRISPR/Cas9 transient gene editing screening tools in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y has been hindered by difficulty of delivering high quantities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ically active single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Furthermore, it has been largely accepted that in vivo generated sgRNAs need to be devoid of extraneous nucleotides, which has limited sgRNA expression by delivery vectors. Here, we increased cellular concentrations of sgRNA by transiently delivering sgRNAs using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-derived vector (TRBO) designed with 5′ and 3′ sgRNA proximal nucleotide-processing capabilities. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we used the TRBO-sgRNA delivery platform to target GFP in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (16c) plants, and gene editing was accompanied by loss of GFP expression. Surprisingly, indel (insertions and deletions) percentages averaged nearly 70% within 7 d postinoculation using the TRBO-sgRNA constructs, which retained 5′ nucleotide overhangs. In contrast, and in accordance with current models, in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays only edited DNA when 5′ sgRNA nucleotide overhangs were removed, suggesting a novel processing mechanism is occurring in planta. Since the Cas9/TRBO-sgRNA platform demonstrated sgRNA flexibility, we targeted the <i>N. benthamiana NbAGO1</i> paralogs with one sgRNA and also multiplexed two sgRNAs using a single TRBO construct, resulting in indels in three genes. TRBO-mediated expression of an RNA transcript consisting of an sgRNA adjoining a GFP protein coding region produced indels and viral-based GFP overexpression. In conclusion, multiplexed delivery of sgRNAs using the TRBO system offers flexibility for gene expression and editing and uncovered novel aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Small molecules are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in screens designed with a basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

Identification of Phosphorylation Sites Altering Pollen Soluble Inorganic Pyrophosphatase Activity<xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Protein phosphorylation regulates numerous cellular processes. Identifying the substrates and protein kinases involved is vital to understand how these important posttranslational modifications modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function in eukaryotic cells. Pyrophosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of inorganic phosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>) to inorganic phosphate P<sub>i</sub>, driving biosynthetic reactions; they are essential for low cytosolic inorganic phosphate. It was suggested recently that posttranslational regulation of Family I soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPases) may affect their activity. We previously demonstrated that two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed sPPases, Pr-p26.1a and Pr-p26.1b, from the flowering plant <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> were inhibited by phosphorylation. Despite the potential significance, there is a paucity of data on sPPase phosphorylation and regulation. Here, we used liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry to map phosphorylation sites to the otherwise divergent amino-terminal extensions on these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> sPPases. Despite the absence of reports in the literature on mapping phosphorylation sites on sPPases, a database survey of various proteomes identified a number of examples, suggesting that phosphorylation may be a more widely used mechanism to regulate these enzymes. Phosphomimetic mutants of Pr-p26.1a/b significantly and differentially reduced PPase activities by up to 2.5-fold at pH 6.8 and 52% in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and hydrogen peroxide over unmodified proteins. This indicates that phosphoregulation of key sites can inhibit the catalytic responsiveness of these proteins in concert with key intracellular events. As sPPases are essential for many metabolic pathways in eukaryotic cells, our findings identify the phosphorylation of sPPases as a potential master regulatory mechanism that could be used to attenuate metabolism.</p>

Combined Experimental and Computational Approaches Reveal Distinct pH Dependence of Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors
<p>The fine-tuning of the degree of methylesterification of cell wall pectin is a key to regulating cell elongation and ultimately the shape of the plant body. Pectin methylesterification is spatiotemporally controlled by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; 66 members in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]). The comparably large number of proteinaceous pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs; 76 members in Arabidopsis) questions the specificity of the PME-PMEI interaction and the functional role of such abundance. To understand the difference, or redundancy, between PMEIs, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the behavior of two PMEIs that are coexpressed and have distinct effects on plant development: AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9. Simulations revealed the structural determinants of the pH dependence for the interaction of these inhibitors with AtPME3, a major PME expressed in roots. Key residues that are likely to play a role in the pH dependence were identified. The predictions obtained from MD simulations were confirmed in vitro, showing that AtPMEI9 is a stronger, less pH-independent inhibitor compared with AtPMEI4. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes as a developmental model, we showed that these biochemical differences have a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical significance. Application of purified proteins at pH ranges in which PMEI inhibition differed between AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9 had distinct consequences on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube elongation. Therefore, MD simulations have proven to be a powerful tool to predict functional diversity between PMEIs, allowing the discovery of a strategy that may be used by PMEIs to inhibit PMEs in different microenvironmental conditions and paving the way to identify the specific role of PMEI diversity in muro.</p>

Spinopelvic mobility and acetabular component position for total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Posterior tilt of the pelvis with sitting provides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical   acetabular opening. Our goal was to study the post-operative interaction   of skeletal mobility and sagittal acetabular component position.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a radiographic study of 160 hips (151 patients) who   prospectively had lateral spinopelvic hip radiographs for skeletal   and implant measurements. Intra-operative acetabular component position   was determined according to the pre-operative spinal mobility.

A draft genome of the brown alga, <i>Cladosiphon okamuranus</i>, S-strain: a platform for future studies of ‘mozuku’ biology
<p>The brown alga, <i>Cladosiphon okamuranus</i> (Okinawa mozuku), is economically one of the most important edible seaweeds, and is cultivated for market primarily in Okinawa, Japan. <i>C. okamuranus</i> constitutes a significant source of fucoidan, which has various physiological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical activities. To facilitate studies of seaweed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y, we decoded the draft genome of <i>C. okamuranus</i> S-strain. The genome size of <i>C. okamuranus</i> was estimated as ∼140 Mbp, smaller than genomes of two other brown algae, <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i> and <i>Saccharina japonica</i>. Sequencing with ∼100× coverage yielded an assembly of 541 scaffolds with N50 = 416 kbp. Together with transcriptomic data, we estimated that the <i>C. okamuranus</i> genome contains 13,640 protein-coding genes, approximately 94% of which have been confirmed with corresponding mRNAs. Comparisons with the <i>E. siliculosus</i> genome identified a set of <i>C. okamuranus</i> genes that encode enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways for sulfated fucans and alginate biosynthesis. In addition, we identified <i>C. okamuranus</i> genes for enzymes involved in phlorotannin biosynthesis. The present decoding of the <i>Cladosiphon okamuranus</i> genome provides a platform for future studies of mozuku <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y.</p>

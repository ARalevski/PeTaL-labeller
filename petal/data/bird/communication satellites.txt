Pericardial Adipose Tissue Regulates Granulopoiesis, Fibrosis, and Cardiac Function After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The pericardial adipose tissue (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>) contains a high density of lymphoid clusters. It is unknown whether these clusters play a role in post–myocardial infarction (MI) inflamm<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ory responses and cardiac outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lymphoid clusters were examined in epicardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> of humans with or without coronary artery disease. Murine pericardial lymphoid clusters were visualized in mice subjected to coronary artery lig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion. To study the relevance of pericardial clusters during inflamm<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ory responses after MI, we surgically removed the pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> and performed B-cell depletion and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>or blockade. Leukocytes in murine hearts, pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>, spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bone marrow were quantified by flow cytometry. Cannabinoid receptor CB2 (CB2<sup>–/–</sup>) mice were used as a model for enhanced B-cell responses. The effect of impaired dendritic cell (DC) trafficking on pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> inflamm<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ory responses was tested in CCR7<sup>–/–</sup> mice subjected to MI. Cardiac fibrosis and ventricular function were assessed by histology and echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified larger B-cell clusters in epicardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> of human p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ients with coronary artery disease in comparison with controls without coronary artery disease.

This was associ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed with higher DC and T-cell counts in pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>, which outnumbered DCs and T cells in lymph nodes.

Gibberellins Regulate Ovule Integument Development by Interfering with the Transcription Factor ATS

Nuclear Prohibitin3 Maintains Genome Integrity and Cell Proliferation in the Root Meristem through Minichromosome Maintenance 2
<p>The nucleo-mitochondrial dual-localized proteins can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as gene expression regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ors; however, few instances of these proteins have been described in plants. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROHIBITIN 3 (PHB3) is involved in stress responses and developmental processes, but it is unknown how these roles are achieved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the molecular level in the nucleus. In this study, we show th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> nucleo-mitochondrial PHB3 plays an essential role in regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing genome stability and cell prolifer<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion. <i>PHB3</i> is up-regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed by DNA damage agents, and the stress-induced PHB3 proteins accumul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e in the nucleus. Loss of function of <i>PHB3</i> results in DNA damage and defective maintenance of the root stem cell niche. Subsequently, the expression p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>terns and levels of the root stem cell regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ors are altered and down-regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed, respectively. In addition, the <i>phb3</i> mutant shows aberrant cell division and altered expression of cell cycle–rel<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed genes, such as <i>CycB1</i> and <i>Cyclin dependent kinase 1</i>. Moreover, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) genes, e.g. <i>MCM2</i>, <i>MCM3</i>, <i>MCM4</i>, <i>MCM5</i>, <i>MCM6</i>, and <i>MCM7</i>, are up-regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed in the <i>phb3</i> mutant. Reducing the <i>MCM2</i> expression level substantially recovers the DNA damage in the <i>phb3</i> mutant and partially rescues the altered cell prolifer<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion and root deficiency of <i>phb3</i> seedlings. PHB3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as a transcriptional coregul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>or th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> represses <i>MCM2</i> expression by competitively binding to the promoter E2F–cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing elements with E2Fa so as to modul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e primary root growth.

Revolutionary malaria tests have unexpected downsides

Until RDTs became widespread, almost all fevers were tre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed as if they were malaria, leading to the overuse of the new gener<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of "wonder drugs," artemisinin-based combin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion therapies (ACTs), which were in danger of being lost to drug resistance.

Recent studies have revealed th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>P <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as a damage-associ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed molecular p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>tern in plants, and its signaling through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>hogenic microorganisms. Biotrophic and necrotrophic p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>hogens <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>tack plants using different str<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>egies, to which plants respond accordingly with salicyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e-based or jasmon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e/ethylene-based defensive signaling, respectively. Interestingly, defense medi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed by P2K1 is effective against p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>hogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>P signaling and th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> of jasmon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e, ethylene, and salicyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e. To address this issue, we analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>P-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the signaling p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>hways of jasmon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e, ethylene, and salicyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e (classic defense hormones) as well as a mutant and an overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor. We found th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> P2K1 function is crucial for faithful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>P-induced transcriptional changes and th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> a subset of genes is more responsive in the P2K1 overexpression line. We also found th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> more than half of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>P-responsive genes required signaling by one or more of the p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>hways for the classical defense hormones, with the jasmon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e-based signaling being more critical than others. By contrast, the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>P-responsive genes were unaffected by deficiencies in signaling for any of the classical defense hormones.

The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase RHA2b Promotes Degradation of MYB30 in Abscisic Acid Signaling
<p>The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical for plants encountering abiotic stress. We reported previously th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transcription f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>or MYB30 particip<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es in ABA responses via SUMO ligase SAP-MIZ Domain-Containing SIZ1-medi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed sumoyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion. Here, we show th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase RHA2b, which positively regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es ABA signaling, inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ed with and ubiquitin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed MYB30 to modul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e MYB30 stability through the 26S proteasome p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>hway. The degrad<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e of MYB30 was repressed significantly in the <i>rha2b-1</i> mutant. Phenotypic analyses showed th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> <i>MYB30</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s genetically downstream of <i>RHA2b</i> in ABA signaling. Substitutions of lysine-283 (K283) and K165 blocked ubiquitin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion, suggesting th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> these residues are sites of ubiquitin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion. K283 residue substitution significantly inhibited the degrad<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of MYB30 induced by ABA. The K165 site functioned additively with K283 in ABA-induced MYB30 degrad<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion and ABA responses. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the same time, sumoyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion protected MYB30 from degrad<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion under cycloheximide and ABA tre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ment. Compared with MYB30, overexpression of MYB30-SUMO1 partially recovered the ABA sensitivity of <i>siz1-2</i>. But MYB30-SUMO1 exhibited similar localiz<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion with MYB30 in nuclei. Overall, our results suggest th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> RHA2b targets MYB30 for degrad<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion to modul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e ABA signaling.

The RopGEF2-ROP7/ROP2 Pathway Activated by phyB Suppresses Red Light-Induced Stomatal Opening<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Circadian rhythm of stom<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>al aperture is mainly regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed by light/darkness.

ROP2, a member of Rho GTPase family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>), has been found to neg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ively regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e light-induced stom<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>al opening. However, the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>or (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ion of RopGEFs-ROPs.

Heterochronic Meiotic Misexpression in an Interspecific Yeast Hybrid
<p>Regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ory changes rapidly accumul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e between species, and interspecific hybrids often misexpress genes. Hybrid misexpression, expression levels outside the range of both parental species, can result from <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ory changes th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> abnormally in hybrids. Thus, misexpressed genes may contribute to hybrid sterility. However, in the context of a whole organism, misexpression may not result directly from <i>cis–trans</i> inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ions but r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>her indirectly from differences between hybrid and parental abundance of cell types. Here we elimin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e the confounding effects of cell types by examining gene expression in a sterile interspecific yeast hybrid during meiosis. We investig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed gene expression of the yeasts <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>S. paradoxus</i>, and their hybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> multiple meiotic stages. Although the hybrid and parents exhibit similar changes in expression levels across meiosis, the hybrid meiotic program occurs earlier than either parent. The timing change produces a heterochronic p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>tern of misexpression during midmeiosis. Coincident with the timing of misexpression, we find a transition from predominantly <i>trans</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing to <i>cis-</i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing expression divergence and an increase in the number of opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes. However, we find no direct rel<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ionship between opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes and misexpression. Contrary to the notion th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> <i>cis–trans</i> inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ions cause misexpression, a heterochronic shift in the normal meiotic gene expression program produces p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>terns of misexpression in an yeast hybrid. Our results imply th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> temporal dynamics of single cell types is important to understanding hybrid misexpression and its rel<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ionship to <i>cis–trans</i> inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ions.</p>

Transcriptional regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of pollen wall form<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion has been studied extensively, and a specific regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ory mechanism for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) pollen flavonol biosynthesis has been postul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed.

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian oscill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>or of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing as an acceler<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>or and exogenous nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing as a brake. Changes in circadian oscill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>or period are thought to adjust the timing of biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian oscill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>or becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed with the dynamic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>).

Screening for Biologically Annotated Drugs That Trigger Triacylglycerol Accumulation in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i>

Using this screen, we identified 34 molecules <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing in a dose-dependent manner. Previously char<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>erized targets of these compounds include cell division and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five compounds possibly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> is used in contraceptive pills and known for its ecological imp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as an endocrine disruptor.

The <i>P. tricornutum</i> transcriptomic response to tre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ment with ethynylestradiol was consistent with the realloc<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of carbon from sterols to acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ion and c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>abolism of ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed cytochrome P450 proteins.

Cytokinin Targets Auxin Transport to Promote Shoot Branching
<p>Cytokinin promotes shoot branching by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>iv<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing axillary buds, but its mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in this process is unclear. We have shown previously th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> a hextuple mutant lacking a clade of type-A Arabidopsis Response Regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ors (ARRs) known to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> in cytokinin signaling has reduced shoot branching compared with the wild type. Since these proteins typically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as neg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ive regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ors of cytokinin signaling, this is an unexpected result. To explore this paradox more deeply, we char<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>erized the effects of loss of function of the type-B ARR, ARR1, which positively regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es cytokinin-induced gene expression. The <i>arr1</i> mutant has increased branching, consistent with a role antagonistic to the type-A ARRs but in apparent conflict with the known positive role for cytokinin in bud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>iv<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion. We show th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the <i>arr</i> branching phenotypes correl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e with increases in stem auxin transport and steady-st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e levels of the auxin export proteins PIN3 and PIN7 on the plasma membrane of xylem-associ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed cells in the main stem. Cytokinin tre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ment results in an increased accumul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of PIN3, PIN7, and the closely rel<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed PIN4 within several hours, and loss of <i>PIN3</i>, <i>PIN4</i>, and <i>PIN7</i> can partially rescue the <i>arr1</i> branching phenotype. This suggests th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> there are multiple signaling p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>hways for cytokinin in bud outgrowth; one of these p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>hways regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es PIN proteins in shoots, independently of the canonical signaling function of the <i>ARR</i> genes tested here. A hypothesis consistent with the <i>arr</i> shoot phenotypes is th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> feedback control of biosynthesis leads to altered cytokinin accumul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion, driving cytokinin signaling via this p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>hway.</p>

Auxin Contributes to the Intraorgan Regulation of Gene Expression in Response to Shade

ALY RNA-Binding Proteins Are Required for Nucleocytosolic mRNA Transport and Modulate Plant Growth and Development
<p>The regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed transport of mRNAs from the cell nucleus to the cytosol is a critical step linking transcript synthesis and processing with transl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion. However, in plants, only a few of the f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ors th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> in the mRNA export p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>hway have been functionally char<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>erized. Flowering plant genomes encode several members of the ALY protein family, which function as mRNA export f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ors in other organisms. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ALY1 to ALY4 are commonly detected in root and leaf cells, but they are differentially expressed in reproductive tissue. Moreover, the subnuclear distribution of ALY1/2 differs from th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> of ALY3/4. ALY1 binds with higher affinity to single-stranded RNA than double-stranded RNA and single-stranded DNA and inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s preferentially with 5-methylcytosine-modified single-stranded RNA. Compared with the full-length protein, the individual RNA recognition motif of ALY1 binds RNA only weakly. ALY proteins inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> with the RNA helicase UAP56, indic<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing a link to the mRNA export machinery. Consistently, ALY1 complements the lethal phenotype of yeast cells lacking the ALY1 ortholog Yra1. Whereas individual <i>aly</i> mutants have a wild-type appearance, disruption of <i>ALY1</i> to <i>ALY4</i> in <i>4xaly</i> plants causes veget<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ive and reproductive defects, including strongly reduced growth, altered flower morphology, as well as abnormal ovules and female gametophytes, causing reduced seed production. Moreover, polyadenyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed mRNAs accumul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e in the nuclei of <i>4xaly</i> cells.

Multiplex Fluorescent, Activity-Based Protein Profiling Identifies Active α-Glycosidases and Other Hydrolases in Plants
<p>With nearly 140 α-glycosidases in 14 different families, plants are well equipped with enzymes th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> can break the α-glucosidic bonds in a large diversity of molecules. Here, we introduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity-based protein profiling (ABPP) of α-glycosidases in plants using α-configured cyclophellitol aziridine probes carrying various fluorophores or biotin. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), these probes label members of the GH31 family of glycosyl hydrolases, including endoplasmic reticulum-resident α-glucosidase-II Radial Swelling3/Priority for Sweet Life5 (RSW3/PSL5) and Golgi-resident α-mannosidase-II Hybrid Glycosyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion1 (HGL1), both of which trim <i>N</i>-glycans on glycoproteins. We detected the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ive st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e of extracellular α-glycosidases such as α-xylosidase XYL1, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s on xyloglucans in the cell wall to promote cell expansion, and α-glucosidase AGLU1, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s in starch hydrolysis and can suppress fungal invasion. Labeling of α-glycosidases gener<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es pH-dependent signals th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> can be suppressed by α-glycosidase inhibitors in a broad range of plant species. To demonstr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e its use on a nonmodel plant species, we applied ABPP on saffron crocus (<i>Crocus s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ivus</i>), a cash crop for the production of saffron spice. Using a combin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of biotinyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed glycosidase probes, we identified and quantified 67 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ive glycosidases in saffron crocus stigma, of which 10 are differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ive. We also uncovered massive changes in hydrolase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivities in the corms upon infection with <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> using multiplex fluorescence labeling in combin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion with probes for serine hydrolases and cysteine proteases. These experiments demonstr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e the ease with which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ive α-glycosidases and other hydrolases can be analyzed through ABPP in model and nonmodel plants.</p>

Dynamics of Ethylene Production in Response to Compatible Nod Factor

Pollen Aperture Factor INP1 Acts Late in Aperture Formation by Excluding Specific Membrane Domains from Exine Deposition

To study how cells achieve this accuracy, we use form<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of pollen apertures as a model. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), three regions on the pollen surface lack deposition of pollen wall exine and develop into apertures. In developing pollen, Arabidopsis <i>INAPERTUR<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>E POLLEN1</i> (INP1) protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as a marker for the preaperture domains, assembling there into three punct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e lines.

Transcription Factor Interplay between LEAFY and APETALA1/CAULIFLOWER during Floral Initiation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transcription f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ors LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1), together with the AP1 paralog CAULIFLOWER (CAL), control the onset of flower development in a partially redundant manner. This redundancy is thought to be medi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> least in part, through the regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of a shared set of target genes. However, whether these genes are independently or cooper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ively regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed by LFY and AP1/CAL is currently unknown. To better understand the regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ory rel<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ionship between LFY and AP1/CAL and to obtain deeper insights into the control of floral initi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion, we monitored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity of LFY in the absence of AP1/CAL function. We found th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of several known LFY target genes is unaffected by AP1/CAL perturb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion, while others appear to require AP1/CAL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity. Furthermore, we obtained evidence th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> LFY and AP1/CAL control the expression of some genes in an antagonistic manner. Notably, these include key regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ors of floral initi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion such as <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>), which had been previously reported to be directly repressed by both LFY and AP1.

A Plant Cryptochrome Controls Key Features of the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Circadian Clock and Its Life Cycle

Histone Lysine-to-Methionine Mutations Reduce Histone Methylation and Cause Developmental Pleiotropy
<p>Epigenetic modific<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ions play critical roles in diverse biological processes.

However, it is largely unknown whether K-to-M mut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ions imp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> organismal development. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a model system, we discovered th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> a transgene exogenously expressing histone 3 Lys-36 to Met mut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion (K36M) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s in a dominant-neg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ive manner to cause global reduction of H3K36 methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion.

A Palmitic Acid Elongase Affects Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Plastidial Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Levels in Nannochloropsis
<p><i>Nannochloropsis</i> species are oleaginous eukaryotes containing a plastid limited by four membranes, deriving from a secondary endosymbiosis. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, thylakoid lipids, including monogal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>osyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. F<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ty acids are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyuns<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ur<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ty acids (FAs) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The production of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown process. We identified seven elongases and five des<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>urases possibly involved in EPA production in <i>Nannochloropsis gaditana</i>. Among the six heterokont-specific s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ur<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed FA elongases possibly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing upstream in this p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>hway, we char<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>erized the highly expressed isoform <i>Δ0-ELO1</i>. Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) showed th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> NgΔ0-ELO1 could elong<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e palmitic acid. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> Δ0-elo1 mutants exhibited a reduced EPA level and a specific decrease in MGDG. In NgΔ0-elo1 lines, the impairment of photosynthesis is consistent with a role of EPA-rich MGDG in nonphotochemical quenching control, possibly providing an appropri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e MGDG pl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>form for the xanthophyll cycle. Concomitantly with MGDG decrease, the level of triacylglycerol (TAG) containing medium chain FAs increased. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, part of EPA used for MGDG production is therefore biosynthesized by a channeled process initi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the elong<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion step of palmitic acid by Δ0-ELO1, thus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing as a committing enzyme for gal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>olipid production. Based on the MGDG/TAG balance controlled by Δ0-ELO1, this study also provides novel prospects for the engineering of oleaginous microalgae for biotechnological applic<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ions.</p>

We reveal a novel role for DEK1 in the regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of leaf epidermal cell wall structure.

Retrotransposon-Mediated Aluminum Tolerance through Enhanced Expression of the Citrate Transporter OsFRDL4

The loc<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma.

Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>io of GC > <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>:<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes.

These observ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ions resemble the p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>terns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e of sex chromosome differenti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ypically low.

The Developmental Brain Gene <i>NPAS3</i> Contains the Largest Number of Accelerated Regulatory Sequences in the Human Genome
<p>To identify the evolutionary genetic novelties th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> contributed to shape human-specific traits such as the use of a complex language, long-term planning and exceptional learning abilities is one of the ultim<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e frontiers of modern biology. Evolutionary sign<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ures of functional shifts could be detected by comparing noncoding regions th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> are highly conserved across mammals or prim<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es and rapidly accumul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed nucleotide substitutions only in the lineage leading to humans. As gene loci densely popul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed with human-acceler<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed elements (HAEs) are more likely to have contributed to human-specific novelties, we sought to identify the transcriptional units and genomic 1 Mb intervals of the entire human genome carrying the highest number of HAEs. To this end, we took advantage of four available d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>a sets of human genomic acceler<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed regions obtained through different comparisons and algorithms and performed a meta-analysis of the combined d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>a. We found th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the brain developmental transcription f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>or <i>neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3</i> (<i>NPAS3</i>) contains the largest cluster of noncoding-acceler<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed regions in the human genome with up to 14 elements th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> are highly conserved in mammals, including prim<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es, but carry human-specific nucleotide substitutions. We then tested the ability of the 14 HAEs identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the <i>NPAS3</i> locus to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as transcriptional regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ory sequences in a reporter expression assay performed in transgenic zebrafish. We found th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> 11 out of the 14 HAEs present in <i>NPAS3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as transcriptional enhancers during development, particularly within the nervous system. As <i>NPAS3</i> is known to play a crucial role during mammalian brain development, our results indic<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the high density of HAEs present in the human <i>NPAS3</i> locus could have modified the sp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>iotemporal expression p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>tern of <i>NPAS3</i> in the developing human brain and, therefore, contributed to human brain evolution.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underw<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>er environment, sound propag<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es both as a pressure wave and as particle motion, with particle motion domin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing close to the source. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed by the particle motion component of sound. The encoding of the anterior l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>eral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed gre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>est sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orient<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be rel<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innerv<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion. L<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>eral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to bo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>whistle vocalis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ions, with gre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>est spike r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es exhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> oyster toadfish can use their l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>eral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>hway to aid in sound source localis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibern<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemline<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>us</i>) altern<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e between two distinct metabolic st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e (MR) and body temper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ure (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e-fuelled respir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ur<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing succin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e concentr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e concentr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ions or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e concentr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion during torpor. The present study confirmed th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> succin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e oxid<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e concentr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ions. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a gre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>er affinity for oxaloacet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> SDH inhibition initi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained rel<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ively higher respir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> low succin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e concentr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ions, which reduces the extent of energy savings th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxid<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ive capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing rapid recruitment of oxid<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ive capacity during arousal.</p>

Functional outcome and alignment in computer-assisted and conventionally operated total knee replacements
<p>We performed a randomised controlled trial comparing   computer-assisted surgery (CAS) with conventional surgery (CONV)   in total knee replacement (TKR).

Dynamic clonal analysis based on chronic <i>in vivo</i> imaging allows multiscale quantification of growth in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc
<p>In the course of morphogenesis, tissues change shape and grow. How this is orchestr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed is largely unknown, partly owing to the lack of experimental methods to visualize and quantify growth. Here, we describe a novel experimental approach to investig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e the growth of tissues <i>in vivo</i> on a time-scale of days, as employed to study the <i>Drosophila</i> larval imaginal wing disc, the precursor of the adult wing. We developed a protocol to image wing discs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> regular intervals in living anesthetized larvae so as to follow the growth of the tissue over extended periods of time.

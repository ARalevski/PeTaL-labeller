Taxon-restricted genes at the origin of a novel trait allowing access to a new environment
<p>Taxon-restricted genes make up a considerable proportion of genomes, yet their contribution to phenotypic evolution is poorly understood. We combined gene expression with functional and behavioral assays to study the origin and adaptive value of an evolutionary innovation exclusive to the water strider genus <i>Rhagovelia</i>: the propelling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fan</span></strong>. We discovered that two taxon-restricted genes, which we named <i>geisha</i> and <i>mother-of-geisha</i>, specifically control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fan</span></strong> development. <i>geisha</i> originated through a duplication event at the base of the <i>Rhagovelia</i> lineage, and both duplicates acquired a novel expression in a specific cell population prefiguring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fan</span></strong> development. These gene duplicates played a central role in <i>Rhagovelia</i>â€™s adaptation to a new physical environment, demonstrating that the evolution of taxon-restricted genes can contribute directly to evolutionary novelties that allow access to unexploited ecological niches.</p>

A sleep-inducing gene, <i>nemuri</i>, links sleep and immune function in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Sleep remains a major mystery of biology. In particular, little is known about the mechanisms that account for the drive to sleep. In an unbiased screen of more than 12,000 <i>Drosophila</i> lines, we identified a single gene, <i>nemuri</i>, that induces sleep. The NEMURI protein is an antimicrobial peptide that can be secreted ectopically to drive prolonged sleep (with resistance to arousal) and to promote survival after infection. Loss of <i>nemuri</i> increased arousability during daily sleep and attenuated the acute increase in sleep induced by sleep deprivation or bacterial infection. Conditions that increase sleep drive induced expression of <i>nemuri</i> in a small number of fly brain neurons and targeted it to the sleep-promoting, dorsal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fan</span></strong>-shaped body. We propose that NEMURI is a bona fide sleep homeostasis factor that is particularly important under conditions of high sleep need; because these conditions include sickness, our findings provide a link between sleep and immune function.</p>

Substantial convection and precipitation enhancements by ultrafine aerosol particles
<sec><title>Up with ultrafine aerosol particles</title><p>Ultrafine aerosol particles (smaller than 50 nanometers in diameter) have been thought to be too small to affect cloud formation. Fan <i>et al.</i> show that this is not the case. They studied the effect of urban pollution transported into the otherwise nearly pristine atmosphere of the Amazon. Condensational growth of water droplets around the tiny particles releases latent heat, thereby intensifying atmospheric convection. Thus, anthropogenic ultrafine aerosol particles may exert a more important influence on cloud formation processes than previously believed.</p><p><i>Science</i>, this issue p. www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/fiop::amf2014goamazon, which is available to the community.

Avoiding topsy-turvy: how Anna's hummingbirds (<i>Calypte anna</i>) fly through upward gusts
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Hummingbirds flying through intense upward gusts experience pronounced downward pitching motions (i.e. nose dives). In response, they interrupt flapping, hold the wings dorsally, and angle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fan</span></strong> the tail.</p>

Visual acuity and signal color pattern in an <i>Anolis</i> lizard

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in soils of greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Under moderate and high soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>.</p>

Profiling the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force in B cell activation
<p>B lymphocytes use B cell receptors (BCRs) to recognize membrane-bound antigens to further initiate cell spreading and contraction responses during B cell activation. We combined traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e microscopy and live-cell imaging to profile the origin, dynamics, and function of traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation in these responses. We showed that B cell activation required the generation of 10 to 20 nN of traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e when encountering antigens presented by substrates with stiffness values from 0.5 to 1 kPa, which mimic the rigidity of antigen-presenting cells in vivo. Perturbation experiments revealed that F-actin remodeling and myosin- and dynein-mediated contractility contributed to traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation and B cell activation. Moreover, membrane-proximal BCR signaling molecules (including Lyn, Syk, Btk, PLC-γ2, BLNK, and Vav3) and adaptor molecules (Grb2, Cbl, and Dok-3) linking BCR microclusters and motor proteins were also required for the sustained generation of these traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es. We found a positive correlation between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> of the traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e and the mean fluorescence intensity of the BCR microclusters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that isotype-switched memory B cells expressing immunoglobulin G (IgG)–BCRs generated greater traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es than did mature naive B cells expressing IgM-BCRs during B cell activation. Last, we observed that primary B cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis generated greater traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es than did B cells from healthy donors in response to antigen stimulation. Together, these data delineate the origin, dynamics, and function of traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e during B cell activation.</p>

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   alignment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es during static and dynamic weight-bearing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es and moments were measured in nine   patients with instrumented knee implants. Medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratios were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend). Hip-knee-ankle angles in the frontal plane were analysed   using full-leg coronal radiographs. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratio strongly correlated with the tibiofemoral   alignment in the static condition of one-legged stance (R² = 0.88)   and dynamic single-limb loading (R² = 0.59) with varus malalignment   leading to increased medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratios of up to 88%. In contrast,   the correlation between leg alignment and magnitude of medial compartment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e   was much less pronounced. A lateral shift of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e occurred during   activities with double-limb support and higher knee flexion angles. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratio depends on both the tibiofemoral alignment   and the nature of the activity involved. It cannot be generalised   to a single value. Higher medial ratios during single-limb loading   are associated with varus malalignment in TKA. The current trend   towards a ‘constitutional varus’ after joint replacement, in terms   of overall tibiofemoral alignment, should be considered carefully   with respect to the increased medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratio.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:779–87.</p></sec>

Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p>Cell motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and cancer cell invasion. It is generally thought that migrating cells grab and exert traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e onto the extracellular matrix in order to pull the cell body forward. While previous studies have shown that myosin II deficient cells migrate efficiently, whether these cells exert traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es during cell migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e sensor and shRNA specific to each myosin II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how myosin IIA and IIB individually regulate cell migration and traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation. Myosin IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual myosin II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, myosin IIA deficient cells lost actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas myosin IIB deficient cells maintained similar actin organization and focal adhesions as wild-type cells. Interestingly, myosin IIA deficient cells migrated faster than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet myosin IIA deficient cells exerted significantly less traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e at the leading edge than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells. These results suggest that, in the absence of myosin IIA mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-generating machinery, cells move with minimal traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es at the cell periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of cells to adapt and migrate.</p>

Molecular mechanism of extreme mechanostability in a pathogen adhesin
<p>High resilience to mechanical stress is key when pathogens adhere to their target and initiate infection. Using atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e microscopy–based single-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e spectroscopy, we explored the mechanical stability of the prototypical staphylococcal adhesin SdrG, which targets a short peptide from human fibrinogen β. Steered molecular dynamics simulations revealed, and single-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e spectroscopy experiments confirmed, the mechanism by which this complex withstands <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es of over 2 nanonewtons, a regime previously associated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> of a covalent bond. The target peptide, confined in a screwlike manner in the binding pocket of SdrG, distributes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es mainly toward the peptide backbone through an intricate hydrogen bond network. Thus, these adhesins can attach to their target with exceptionally resilient mechanostability, virtually independent of peptide side chains.</p>

The functional role of caudal and anal/dorsal fins during the C-start of a bluegill sunfish
<p>Fast starts are crucial in the survival of aquatic swimmers to capture prey or avoid predators. Currently, it is widely accepted that during C-starts: (1) the caudal fin generates a considerable hydrodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e; and (2) anal/dorsal fins are erected to significantly increase the hydrodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e. In this work, the above hypotheses on the role of fins during C-starts are studied using experimentally guided numerical simulations of four bluegill sunfish, whose fins are removed or erected. The amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e created by the body and fins at each time instant was not constant and varied during the C-start. Nevertheless, in agreement with hypothesis (1), up to 70% of the instantaneous hydrodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was generated by the tail during Stage 2 of the C-start, when the sunfish rapidly bends out of the C-shape. Additionally, the contribution in Stage 1, when the sunfish bends into a C-shape, is less than 20% at each instant. Most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e in Stage 1 was produced by the body of the sunfish. In contrast to hypothesis (2), the effect of erection/removal of the fins was less than 5% of the instantaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e in both Stages 1 and 2, except for a short period of time (2 ms) just before Stage 2. However, it is known that the anal/dorsal fins are actively controlled during the C-start from muscle activity measurements. Based on the results presented here, it is suggested that the active control of the anal/dorsal fins can be related to retaining the stability of the sunfish against roll and pitch movements during the C-start. Furthermore, the erection of the fins increases the moment of inertia to make the roll and pitch movements more difficult.</p>

Vinculin forms a directionally asymmetric catch bond with F-actin
<p>Vinculin is an actin-binding protein thought to rein<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. However, how mechanical load affects the vinculin–F-actin bond is unclear. Using a single-molecule optical trap assay, we found that vinculin forms a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-dependent catch bond with F-actin through its tail domain, but with lifetimes that depend strongly on the direction of the applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e toward the pointed (–) end of the actin filament resulted in a bond that was maximally stable at 8 piconewtons, with a mean lifetime (12 seconds) 10 times as long as the mean lifetime when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was applied toward the barbed (+) end. A computational model of lamellipodial actin dynamics suggests that the directionality of the vinculin–F-actin bond could establish long-range order in the actin cytoskeleton. The directional and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-stabilized binding of vinculin to F-actin may be a mechanism by which adhesion complexes maintain front-rear asymmetry in migrating cells.</p>

Precipitation strengthening of aluminum alloys by room-temperature cyclic plasticity
<p>High-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> aluminum alloys are important for lightweighting vehicles and are extensively used in aircraft and, increasingly, in automobiles. The highest-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> aluminum alloys require a series of high-temperature “bakes” (120° to 200°C) to form a high number density of nanoparticles by solid-state precipitation. We found that a controlled, room-temperature cyclic deformation is sufficient to continuously inject vacancies into the material and to mediate the dynamic precipitation of a very fine (1- to 2-nanometer) distribution of solute clusters. This results in better material <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> and elongation properties relative to traditional thermal treatments, despite a much shorter processing time. The microstructures formed are much more uniform than those characteristic of traditional thermal treatments and do not exhibit precipitate-free zones. These alloys are therefore likely to be more resistant to damage.</p>

Multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles and superb mechanical behaviors of complex alloys
<p>Alloy design based on single–principal-element systems has approached its limit for performance enhancements. A substantial increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> up to gigapascal levels typically causes the premature failure of materials with reduced ductility. Here, we report a strategy to break this trade-off by controllably introducing high-density ductile multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles (MCINPs) in complex alloy systems. Distinct from the intermetallic-induced embrittlement under conventional wisdom, such MCINP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>ened alloys exhibit superior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>s of 1.5 gigapascals and ductility as high as 50% in tension at ambient temperature. The plastic instability, a major concern for high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> materials, can be completely eliminated by generating a distinctive multistage work-hardening behavior, resulting from pronounced dislocation activities and deformation-induced microbands. This MCINP strategy offers a paradigm to develop next-generation materials for structural applications.</p>

Key-and-lock commodity self-healing copolymers
<p>Self-healing materials are notable for their ability to recover from physical or chemical damage. We report that commodity copolymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate)/n-butyl acrylate [p(MMA/nBA)] and their derivatives, can self-heal upon mechanical damage. This behavior occurs in a narrow compositional range for copolymer topologies that are preferentially alternating with a random component (alternating/random) and is attributed to favorable interchain van der Waals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es forming key-and-lock interchain junctions. The use of van der Waals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es instead of supramolecular or covalent rebonding or encapsulated reactants eliminates chemical and physical alterations and enables multiple recovery upon mechanical damage without external intervention. Unlike other self-healing approaches, perturbation of ubiquitous van der Waals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es upon mechanical damage is energetically unfavorable for interdigitated alternating/random copolymer motifs that facilitate self-healing under ambient conditions.</p>

High dislocation density–induced large ductility in deformed and partitioned steels
<p>A wide variety of industrial applications require materials with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> and ductility. Unfortunately, the strategies for increasing material <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>, such as processing to create line defects (dislocations), tend to decrease ductility. We developed a strategy to circumvent this in inexpensive, medium manganese steel. Cold rolling followed by low-temperature tempering developed steel with metastable austenite grains embedded in a highly dislocated martensite matrix. This deformed and partitioned (D and P) process produced dislocation hardening but retained high ductility, both through the glide of intensive mobile dislocations and by allowing us to control martensitic transformation. The D and P strategy should apply to any other alloy with deformation-induced martensitic transformation and provides a pathway for the development of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>, high-ductility materials.</p>

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals dispersion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

Notch-Jagged complex structure implicates a catch bond in tuning ligand sensitivity
<p>Notch receptor activation initiates cell fate decisions and is distinctive in its reliance on mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e and protein glycosylation.

We introduce a self-assembled nanoscopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e clamp built from DNA that operates autonomously and allows massive parallelization. Single-stranded DNA sections of an origami structure acted as entropic springs and exerted controlled tension in the low piconewton range on a molecular system, whose conformational transitions were monitored by single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer. We used the conformer switching of a Holliday junction as a benchmark and studied the TATA-binding protein–induced bending of a DNA duplex under tension. The observed suppression of bending above 10 piconewtons provides further evidence of mechanosensitivity in gene regulation.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have a far worse prognosis than those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). In the intact heart, SSc-PAH exhibits depressed rest and reserve right ventricular (RV) contractility compared with IPAH. We tested whether this disparity involves underlying differences in myofilament function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac myocytes were isolated from RV septal endomyocardial biopsies from patients with SSc-PAH, IPAH, or SSc with exertional dyspnea but no resting PAH (SSc-d); control RV septal tissue was obtained from nondiseased donor hearts (6–7 per group). Isolated myocyte passive length-tension and developed tension-calcium relationships were determined and correlated with in vivo RV function and reserve. RV septal fibrosis was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocyte passive stiffness from length-tension relations was similarly increased in IPAH and SSc-PAH compared with control, although SSc-PAH biopsies had more interstitial fibrosis. More striking disparities were found between active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-calcium relations. Compared with controls, maximal calcium-activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e (F<sub>max</sub>) was 28% higher in IPAH but 37% lower in SSc-PAH. F<sub>max</sub> in SSc-d was intermediate between control and SSc-PAH. The calcium concentration required for half-maximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e (EC<sub>50</sub>) was similar between control, IPAH, and SSc-d but lower in SSc-PAH. This disparity disappeared in myocytes incubated with the active catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Myocyte F<sub>max</sub> directly correlated with in vivo RV contractility assessed by end-systolic elastance (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.46, <i>P</i>=0.002) and change in end-systolic elastance with exercise (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.49, <i>P</i>=0.008) and was inversely related with exercise-induced chamber dilation (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.63, <i>P</i><0.002), which also was a marker of depressed contractile reserve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A primary defect in human SSc-PAH resides in depressed sarcomere function, whereas this is enhanced in IPAH. These disparities correlate with in vivo RV contractility and contractile reserve and are consistent with worse clinical outcomes in SSc-PAH. The existence of sarcomere disease before the development of resting PAH in patients with SSc-d suggests that earlier identification and intervention may prove useful.</p></sec>

Locally coordinated synaptic plasticity of visual cortex neurons in vivo
<p>Plasticity of cortical responses in vivo involves activity-dependent changes at synapses, but the manner in which different forms of synaptic plasticity act together to create functional changes in neurons remains unknown. We found that spike timing–induced receptive field plasticity of visual cortex neurons in mice is anchored by increases in the synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> of identified spines. This is accompanied by a decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> of adjacent spines on a slower time scale. The locally coordinated potentiation and depression of spines involves prominent AMPA receptor redistribution via targeted expression of the immediate early gene product Arc. Hebbian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>ening of activated synapses and heterosynaptic weakening of adjacent synapses thus cooperatively orchestrate cell-wide plasticity of functional neuronal responses.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems
<p>Mechanical power limitations emerge from the physical trade-off between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e and velocity. Many biological systems incorporate power-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small sizes. We establish how power enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to biological and synthetic systems. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in biological systems. This analysis defines the cascading challenges of power enhancement, explores their emergent effects in biological and engineered systems, and charts a pathway for higher-level analysis and synthesis of power-amplified systems.</p>

Atomic structures of low-complexity protein segments reveal kinked β sheets that assemble networks
<p>Subcellular membraneless assemblies are a reinvigorated area of study in biology, with spirited scientific discussions on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es between the low-complexity protein domains within these assemblies. To illuminate these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es, we determined the atomic structures of five segments from protein low-complexity domains associated with membraneless assemblies. Their common structural feature is the stacking of segments into kinked β sheets that pair into protofilaments. Unlike steric zippers of amyloid fibrils, the kinked sheets interact weakly through polar atoms and aromatic side chains. By computationally threading the human proteome on our kinked structures, we identified hundreds of low-complexity segments potentially capable of forming such interactions. These segments are found in proteins as diverse as RNA binders, nuclear pore proteins, and keratins, which are known to form networks and localize to membraneless assemblies.</p>

Quantum liquid droplets in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates

We demonstrate that they are several orders of magnitude more dilute than liquid helium by directly measuring their size and density via in situ imaging. We show that the droplets are stablized against collapse by quantum fluctuations and that they require a minimum atom number to be stable. Below that number, quantum pressure drives a liquid-to-gas transition that we map out as a function of interaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. These ultradilute isotropic liquids remain weakly interacting and constitute an ideal platform to benchmark quantum many-body theories.</p>

A self-assembled nanoscale robotic arm controlled by electric fields
<p>The use of dynamic, self-assembled DNA nanostructures in the context of nanorobotics requires fast and reliable actuation mechanisms. We therefore created a 55-nanometer–by–55-nanometer DNA-based molecular platform with an integrated robotic arm of length 25 nanometers, which can be extended to more than 400 nanometers and actuated with externally applied electrical fields. Precise, computer-controlled switching of the arm between arbitrary positions on the platform can be achieved within milliseconds, as demonstrated with single-pair Forster resonance energy transfer experiments and fluorescence microscopy. The arm can be used for electrically driven transport of molecules or nanoparticles over tens of nanometers, which is useful for the control of photonic and plasmonic processes.

Mechanochemical unzipping of insulating polyladderene to semiconducting polyacetylene

The resultant polyacetylene block copolymers exhibit long conjugation length and uniform trans-configuration and self-assemble into semiconducting nanowires. Calculations support a tandem unzipping mechanism of the ladderene units.</p>

Experimentally realized mechanochemistry distinct from force-accelerated scission of loaded bonds
<p>Stretching polymer chains accelerates dissociation of a variety of internal covalent bonds, to an extent that correlates well with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e experienced by the scissile bond. Recent theory has also predicted scenarios in which applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e accelerates dissociation of unloaded bonds and kinetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>ens strained bonds. We report here unambiguous experimental validation of this hypothesis: Detailed kinetic measurements demonstrate that stretching phosphotriesters accelerates dissociation of the unloaded phosphorus-oxygen bond orthogonal to the pulling axis, whereas stretching organosiloxanes inhibits dissociation of the aligned loaded silicon-oxygen bonds. Qualitatively, the outcome is determined by phosphoester elongation and siloxane contraction along the pulling axis in the respective rate-determining transition states. Quantitatively, the results agree with a simple mechanochemical kinetics model.</p>

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-phonon coupling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “coherent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-phonon coupling affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.</p>

Higher predation risk for insect prey at low latitudes and elevations
<p>Biotic interactions underlie ecosystem structure and function, but predicting interaction outcomes is difficult.

Across an 11,660-kilometer latitudinal gradient spanning six continents, we found increasing predation toward the equator, with a parallel pattern of increasing predation toward lower elevations. Patterns across both latitude and elevation were driven by arthropod predators, with no systematic trend in attack rates by birds or mammals. These matching gradients at global and regional scales suggest consistent drivers of biotic interaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>, a finding that needs to be integrated into general theories of herbivory, community organization, and life-history evolution.</p>

Greater role for Atlantic inflows on sea-ice loss in the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean
<p>Arctic sea-ice loss is a leading indicator of climate change and can be attributed, in large part, to atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>ing. Here, we show that recent ice reductions, weakening of the halocline, and shoaling of the intermediate-depth Atlantic Water layer in the eastern Eurasian Basin have increased winter ventilation in the ocean interior, making this region structurally similar to that of the western Eurasian Basin. The associated enhanced release of oceanic heat has reduced winter sea-ice formation at a rate now comparable to losses from atmospheric thermodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>ing, thus explaining the recent reduction in sea-ice cover in the eastern Eurasian Basin. This encroaching “atlantification” of the Eurasian Basin represents an essential step toward a new Arctic climate state, with a substantially greater role for Atlantic inflows.</p>

Mega-earthquakes rupture flat megathrusts
<p>The 2004 Sumatra-Andaman and 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquakes highlighted gaps in our understanding of mega-earthquake rupture processes and the factors controlling their global distribution: A fast convergence rate and young buoyant lithosphere are not required to produce mega-earthquakes.

A simplified analytic model demonstrates that heterogeneity in shear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> increases with curvature. Shear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> on flat megathrusts is more homogeneous, and hence more likely to be exceeded simultaneously over large areas, than on highly curved faults.</p>

Environmental and Genetic Factors Regulating Localization of the Plant Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase
<p>A P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is the primary transporter that converts ATP to electrochemical energy at the plasma membrane of higher plants. Its product, the proton-motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e, is composed of an electrical potential and a pH gradient. Many studies have demonstrated that this proton-motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e not only drives the secondary transporters required for nutrient uptake, but also plays a direct role in regulating cell expansion. Here, we have generated a transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plant expressing H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2) that is translationally fused with a fluorescent protein and examined its cellular localization by live-cell microscopy. Using a 3D imaging approach with seedlings grown for various times under a variety of light intensities, we demonstrate that AHA2 localization at the plasma membrane of root cells requires light. In dim light conditions, AHA2 is found in intracellular compartments, in addition to the plasma membrane. This localization profile was age-dependent and specific to cell types found in the transition zone located between the meristem and elongation zones. The accumulation of AHA2 in intracellular compartments is consistent with reduced H<sup>+</sup> secretion near the transition zone and the suppression of root growth. By examining AHA2 localization in a knockout mutant of a receptor protein kinase, FERONIA, we found that the intracellular accumulation of AHA2 in the transition zone is dependent on a functional FERONIA-dependent inhibitory response in root elongation. Overall, this study provides a molecular underpinning for understanding the genetic, environmental, and developmental factors influencing root growth via localization of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p>

Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its rigidity and structural integrity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose surfaces in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold screw conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose surfaces but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold screw conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic surface compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es on the structural integrity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

Biomechanics of substrate boring by fig wasps
<p>Female insects of diverse orders bore into substrates to deposit their eggs. Such insects must overcome several biomechanical challenges to successfully oviposit, which include the selection of suitable substrates through which the ovipositor can penetrate without itself fracturing. In many cases, the insect may also need to steer and manipulate the ovipositor within the substrate to deliver eggs at desired locations before rapidly retracting her ovipositor to avoid predation. In the case of female parasitoid ichneumonid wasps, this process is repeated multiple times during her lifetime, thus testing the ability of the ovipositioning apparatus to endure fracture and fatigue. What specific adaptations does the ovipositioning apparatus of a female ichneumonoid wasp possess to withstand these challenges? We addressed this question using a model system composed of parasitoid and pollinator fig wasps. First, we show that parasitoid ovipositor tips have teeth-like structures, preferentially enriched with zinc, unlike the smooth morphology of pollinator ovipositors. We describe sensillae present on the parasitoid ovipositor tip that are likely to aid in the detection of chemical species and mechanical deformations and sample microenvironments within the substrate. Second, using atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e microscopy, we show that parasitoid tip regions have a higher modulus compared with regions proximal to the abdomen in parasitoid and pollinator ovipositors. Finally, we use videography to film wasps during substrate boring and analyse buckling of the ovipositor to estimate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es required for substrate boring. Together, these results allow us to describe the biomechanical principles underlying substrate boring in parasitoid ichneumonid wasps. Such studies may be useful for the biomimetic design of surgical tools and in the use of novel mechanisms to bore through hard substrates.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e, and faster isometric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Functional outcomes of conservatively managed acute ruptures of the Achilles tendon
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This prospective cohort study aims to determine if the size of   the tendon gap following acute rupture of the Achilles tendon shows   an association with the functional outcome following non-operative   treatment. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients presenting within two weeks of an acute unilateral   rupture of the Achilles tendon between July 2012 and July 2015 were   considered for the study. In total, 38 patients (nine female, 29   male, mean age 52 years; 29 to 78) completed the study. Dynamic   ultrasound examination was performed to confirm the diagnosis and   measure the gap between ruptured tendon ends. Outcome was assessed   using dynamometric testing of plantarflexion and the Achilles tendon   Total Rupture score (ATRS) six months after the completion of a   rehabilitation programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients with a gap ≥ 10 mm with the ankle in the neutral position   had significantly greater peak torque deficit than those with gaps   < 10 mm (mean 23.3%; 7% to 52% <i>vs </i>14.3%; 0% to   47%, p = 0.023). However, there was no difference   in ATRS between the two groups (mean score 87.2; 74 to 100 <i>vs</i> 87.4;   68 to 97, p = 0.467). There was no significant correlation between   gap size and torque deficit (τ = 0.103), suggesting a non-linear relationship.   There was also no significant correlation between ATRS and peak   torque deficit (τ = -0.305). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>This is the first study to identify an association between tendon   gap and functional outcome in acute rupture of the Achilles tendon.   We have identified 10 mm as a gap size at which deficits in plantarflexion   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> become significantly greater, however, the precise relationship   between gap size and plantarflexion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> remains unclear. Large, multicentre   studies will be needed to clarify this relationship and identify   population subgroups in whom deficits in peak torque are reflected   in patient-reported outcome measures. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:87–93.</p></sec>

The quality of Achilles tendon repair five to eight years after percutaneous tenotomy in the treatment of clubfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to describe the mid-term appearances of the repair   process of the Achilles tendon after tenotomy in children with a   clubfoot treated using the Ponseti method.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 15 children (ten boys, five girls) with idiopathic   clubfoot were evaluated at a mean of 6.8 years (5.4 to 8.1) after   complete percutaneous division of the Achilles tendon. The contour   and subjective thickness of the tendon were recorded, and superficial   defects and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> were assessed clinically. The echogenicity,   texture, thickness, peritendinous irregularities and potential for   deformation of the tendon were evaluated by ultrasonography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The appearance of the Achilles tendon was slightly abnormal,   with more thickening and less conspicuous contours than a normal   tendon. Its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> was grossly normal, with no insufficiency of   the triceps surae. Ultrasonographic findings revealed a mild fusiform   thickening in 12 children (80%). The tissue at the site of the repair   had a slightly hypoechoic, fibrillar quality with hyperechoic striation   and the anterior contour was irregular and blurred. There was a   focal narrowing within the healing tissue in two children.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This mid-term evaluation of the ability of the Achilles tendon   to repair after division suggests a combination of intrinsic and   extrinsic mechanisms.

Unconstrained metacarpophalangeal joint arthroplasties
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We performed a systematic review of the current literature regarding   the outcomes of unconstrained metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We initially identified 1305 studies, and 406 were found to be   duplicates. After exclusion criteria were applied, seven studies   were included. Outcomes extracted included pre- and post-operative   pain visual analogue scores, range of movement (ROM), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> of   pinch and grip, satisfaction and patient reported outcome measures   (PROMs). Clinical and radiological complications were recorded.   The results are presented in three groups based on the design of   the arthroplasty and the aetiology (pyrocarbon-osteoarthritis (pyro-OA),   pyrocarbon-inflammatory arthritis (pyro-IA), metal-on-polyethylene   (MoP)).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Results show that pyrocarbon implants provide an 85% reduction   in pain, 144% increase of pinch grip and 13° improvements in ROM   for both OA and IA combined. Patients receiving MoP arthroplasties   had a reduction in pinch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Satisfaction rates were 91% and   92% for pyrocarbon-OA and pyrocarbon-IA groups, respectively. There were   nine failures in 87 joints (10.3%) over a mean follow-up of 5.5   years (1.0 to 14.3) for pyro-OA. There were 18 failures in 149 joints   (12.1%) over a mean period of 6.6 years (1.0 to 16.0) for pyro-IA.   Meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of the studies   and the limited presentation of data.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We would recommend prospective data collection for small joint   arthroplasties of the hand consisting of PROMs that would allow   clinicians to come to stronger conclusions about the impact on function   of replacing the MCPJs.

Comparative study on the effectiveness of a corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome in patients with and without Raynaud’s phenomenon
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of a corticosteroid   injection for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in patients   with and without Raynaud’s phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a prospective study, 139 patients with CTS were treated with   a corticosteroid injection (10 mg triamcinolone acetonide); 34 had   Raynaud’s phenomenon and 105 did not (control group). Grip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>,   perception of touch with a Semmes-Weinstein monofilament and the   Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaires (BCTQ) were assessed at baseline and   at six, 12 and 24 weeks after the injection. The Cold Intolerance   Severity Score (CISS) questionnaire was also assessed at baseline   and 24 weeks after the injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The two groups had similar baseline BCTQ scores, but the scores   in the Raynaud’s phenomenon group were significantly higher than   those in the control group at 12 and 24 weeks after the injection.   Throughout the 24-week follow-up, there were no significant differences   in the mean grip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> between the groups, whereas the mean Semmes-Weinstein   monofilament sensory index for the control group was significantly   higher than that of the Raynaud’s phenomenon group. The mean CISSs   were not significantly different between the groups at baseline   and at 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, 11 patients (32%) in the Raynaud’s   phenomenon group and 16 (15%) in the control group required carpal   tunnel decompression (p = 0.028).

Differential Codon Adaptation between dsDNA and ssDNA Phages in <i>Escherichia coli</i>
<p>Because phages use their host translation machinery, their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong> usage should evolve toward that of highly expressed host genes. We used two indices to measure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong> adaptation of phages to their host, <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> (the correlation in relative synonymous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong> usage [RSCU] between phages and their host) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong> Adaptation Index (CAI) computed with highly expressed host genes as the reference set (because phage translation depends on host translation machinery). These indices used for this purpose are appropriate only when hosts exhibit little mutation bias, so only phages parasitizing <i>Escherichia coli</i> were included in the analysis. For double-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> (ds<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>) phages, both <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> and CAI decrease with increasing number of transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> genes encoded by the phage genome. <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> is greater for ds<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> phages than for single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> (ss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>) phages, and the low <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> values are mainly due to poor concordance in RSCU values for Y-ending <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong>s between ss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> phages and the <i>E. coli</i> host, consistent with the predicted effect of C→T mutation bias in the ss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> phages. Strong C→T mutation bias would improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong> adaptation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong> families (e.g., Gly) where U-ending <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong>s are favored over C-ending <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong>s (“U-friendly” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong> families) by highly expressed host genes but decrease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong> adaptation in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong> families where highly expressed host genes favor C-ending <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong>s against U-ending <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong>s (“U-hostile” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong> families). It is remarkable that ss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> phages with increasing C→T mutation bias also increased the usage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong>s in the “U-friendly” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong> families, thereby achieving CAI values almost as large as those of ds<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> phages. This represents a new type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong> adaptation.</p>

Novel Stress-Inducible Antisense RNAs of Protein-Coding Loci Are Synthesized by RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase
<p>Our previous study identified approximately 6,000 abiotic stress-responsive noncoding transcripts existing on the antisense strand of protein-coding genes and implied that a type of antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> was synthesized from a sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> template by <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong></i> (<i>RDR</i>). Expression analyses revealed that the expression of novel abiotic stress-induced antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> on 1,136 gene loci was reduced in the <i>rdr1/2/6</i> mutants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>se protection indicated that the <i>RD29A</i> antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> and other RDR1/2/6-dependent antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s are involved in the formation of ds<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>. The accumulation of stress-inducible antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> was decreased and increased in <i>dcp5</i> and <i>xrn4</i>, respectively, but not changed in <i>dcl2/3/4</i>, <i>nrpd1a</i> and <i>nrpd1b</i>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-seq analyses revealed that the majority of the RDR1/2/6-dependent antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> loci did not overlap with RDR1/2/6-dependent 20–30 nt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> loci. Additionally, <i>rdr1/2/6</i> mutants decreased the degradation rate of the sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> and exhibited arrested root growth during the recovery stage following a drought stress, whereas <i>dcl2/3/4</i> mutants did not. Collectively, these results indicate that RDRs have stress-inducible antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> synthesis activity and a novel biological function that is different from the known endogenous small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> pathways from protein-coding genes. These data reveal a novel mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> regulation during abiotic stress response that involves complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> degradation pathways.</p>

STING is an essential mediator of the Ku70-mediated production of IFN-λ1 in response to exogenous DNA
<p>We previously identified Ku70, a subunit of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> repair protein complex, as a cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> sensor that induces the production of interferon-λ1 (IFN-λ1) by human primary cells and cell lines. IFN-λ1 is a type III IFN and has similar antiviral activity to that of the type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β). We observed that human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, which are deficient in the innate immune adaptor protein STING (stimulator of IFN genes), did not produce IFN-λ1 in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> unless they were reconstituted with STING. Conversely, parental HEK 293 cells produced IFN-λ1 after they were exposed to exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>; however, when STING was knocked out in the HEK 293 cells through the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 genome editing system, they lost this response. Through confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that endogenous Ku70 was located in the nucleus and then translocated to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong> upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> exposure to form a complex with STING. Additionally, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> binding domain of Ku70 was essential for formation of the Ku70-STING complex. Knocking down STING in primary human macrophages inhibited their ability to produce IFN-λ1 in response to transfection with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> or infection with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> HSV-2 (herpes simplex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>–2). Together, these data suggest that STING mediates the Ku70-mediated IFN-λ1 innate immune response to exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> infection.</p>

CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED Supports Translation under Stress and Interacts with the Ribosomal 30S Subunit
<p>Chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong>s, which originated from cyanobacteria, comprise a large subunit (50S) and a small subunit (30S) containing ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s (r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s) and various ribosomal proteins. Genes for many chloroplast ribosomal proteins, as well as proteins with auxiliary roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> biogenesis or functioning, reside in the nucleus. Here, we identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CHLOROPLAST <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> ASSOCIATED (CRASS), a member of the latter class of proteins, based on the tight coexpression of its m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> with transcripts for nucleus-encoded chloroplast ribosomal proteins. CRASS was acquired during the evolution of embryophytes and is localized to the chloroplast stroma. Loss of CRASS results in minor defects in development, photosynthetic efficiency, and chloroplast translation activity under controlled growth conditions, but these phenotypes are greatly exacerbated under stress conditions induced by the translational inhibitors lincomycin and chloramphenicol or by cold treatment. The CRASS protein comigrates with chloroplast ribosomal particles and coimmunoprecipitates with the 16S r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> and several chloroplast ribosomal proteins, particularly the plastid ribosomal proteins of the 30S subunit (PRPS1 and PRPS5). The association of CRASS with PRPS1 and PRPS5 is independent of r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> and is not detectable in yeast two-hybrid experiments, implying that either CRASS interacts indirectly with PRPS1 and PRPS5 via another component of the small ribosomal subunit or that it recognizes structural features of the multiprotein/r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> particle. CRASS plays a role in the biogenesis and/or stability of the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> that becomes critical under certain stressful conditions when ribosomal activity is compromised.</p>

Guanine glycation repair by DJ-1/Park7 and its bacterial homologs
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> damage induced by reactive carbonyls (mainly methylglyoxal and glyoxal), called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> glycation, is quantitatively as important as oxidative damage. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> glycation is associated with increased mutation frequency, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> strand breaks, and cytotoxicity. However, in contrast to guanine oxidation repair, how glycated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> is repaired remains undetermined. Here, we found that the parkinsonism-associated protein DJ-1 and its bacterial homologs Hsp31, YhbO, and YajL could repair methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotide</span></strong>s and nucleic acids. DJ-1–depleted cells displayed increased levels of glycated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> strand breaks, and phosphorylated p53. Deglycase-deficient bacterial mutants displayed increased levels of glycated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> and exhibited strong mutator phenotypes. Thus, DJ-1 and its prokaryotic homologs constitute a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotide</span></strong> repair system that we name guanine glycation repair.</p>

RNA interference is essential for cellular quiescence
<p>Quiescent cells play a predominant role in most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>isms. Here we identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> interference (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>i) as a major requirement for quiescence (G<sub>0</sub> phase of the cell cycle) in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>i mutants lose viability at G<sub>0</sub> entry and are unable to maintain long-term quiescence. We identified suppressors of G<sub>0</sub> defects in cells lacking Dicer (<i>dcr1</i>Δ), which mapped to genes involved in chromosome segregation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong>–associated factors, and heterochromatin formation. We propose a model in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>i promotes the release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong> in cycling and quiescent cells: (i) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong> II release mediates heterochromatin formation at centromeres, allowing proper chromosome segregation during mitotic growth and G<sub>0</sub> entry, and (ii) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong> I release prevents heterochromatin formation at ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> during quiescence maintenance.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Plant Temperature Acclimation and Growth Rely on Cytosolic Ribosome Biogenesis Factor Homologs
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) REI1-LIKE (REIL) proteins, REIL1 and REIL2, are homologs of a yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> biogenesis factor that participates in late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic 60S ribosomal subunit maturation. Here, we report that the inhibited growth of the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant at 10°C can be rescued by the expression of amino-terminal FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (FP)-REIL fusions driven by the <i>UBIQUITIN10</i> promoter, allowing the analysis of REIL function in planta. Arabidopsis REIL1 appears to be functionally conserved, based on the cytosolic localization of FP-REIL1 and the interaction of native REIL1 with the 60S subunit in wild-type plants. In contrast to its yeast homologs, REIL1 also was present in translating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> fractions. Systems analysis revealed that wild-type Arabidopsis remodels the cytosolic translation machinery when grown at 10°C by accumulating cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> subunits and inducing the expression of cytosolic ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>, ribosomal genes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> biogenesis factors, and translation initiation or elongation factors. In the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant, all processes associated with inhibited growth were delayed, although the plants maintained cellular integrity or acquired freezing tolerance. REIL proteins also were implicated in plant-specific processes: nonacclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> exhibited cold-acclimation responses, including activation of the DREB/CBF regulon. In addition, acclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> plants failed to activate <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> expression in mature leaves. Therefore, in the wild type, REIL function may contribute to temperature perception by suppressing premature cold responses during growth at nonstressful temperatures. In conclusion, we suggest that Arabidopsis REIL proteins influence cold-induced plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> remodeling and enhance the accumulation of cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> subunits after cold shift either by de novo synthesis or by recycling them from the translating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> fraction.</p>

K63-linked polyubiquitin chains bind to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair
<p>Polyubiquitylation is canonically viewed as a posttranslational modification that governs protein stability or protein-protein interactions, in which distinct polyubiquitin linkages ultimately determine the fate of modified protein(s). We explored whether polyubiquitin chains have any nonprotein-related function. Using in vitro pull-down assays with synthetic materials, we found that polyubiquitin chains with the Lys<sup>63</sup> (K63) linkage bound to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> through a motif we called the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>-interacting patch” (DIP), which is composed of the adjacent residues Thr<sup>9</sup>, Lys<sup>11</sup>, and Glu<sup>34</sup>. Upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> damage, the binding of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> enhanced the recruitment of repair factors through their interaction with an Ile<sup>44</sup> patch in ubiquitin to facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> repair. Furthermore, experimental or cancer patient–derived mutations within the DIP impaired the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> binding capacity of ubiquitin and subsequently attenuated K63-linked polyubiquitin chain accumulation at sites of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> damage, thereby resulting in defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> repair and increased cellular sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>-damaging agents. Our results therefore highlight a critical physiological role for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in binding to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> to facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> damage repair.</p>

However, the presence of ribo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotide</span></strong>s in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> makes it more fragile and threatens genome stability that needs to be maintained for faithful transmission of genetic information.

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The binding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">messenger</span></strong> cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which activates innate immune responses. We have shown that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> binding to cGAS robustly induced the formation of liquidlike droplets in which cGAS was activated. The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> phase separation by increasing the valencies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> binding. Long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid phase separation and cGAS enzyme activity than short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>. Moreover, free zinc ions enhanced cGAS enzyme activity both in vitro and in cells by promoting cGAS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> phase separation.

ROS1-Dependent DNA Demethylation Is Required for ABA-Inducible <i>NIC3</i> Expression
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> methylation plays an important role in diverse developmental processes in many eukaryotes, including the response to environmental stress. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that is up-regulated under stress. The involvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> methylation in the ABA response has been reported but is poorly understood. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> demethylation is a reverse process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> methylation and often induces structural changes of chromatin leading to transcriptional activation. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana)</i>, active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> demethylation depends on the activity of REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1), which directly excises 5-methylcytosine from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>. Here we showed that <i>ros1</i> mutants were hypersensitive to ABA during early seedling development and root elongation. Expression levels of some ABA-inducible genes were decreased in <i>ros1</i> mutants, and more than 60% of their proximal regions became hypermethylated, indicating that a subset of ABA-inducible genes are under the regulation of ROS1-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> demethylation. Notable among them is <i>NICOTINAMIDASE 3</i> (<i>NIC3</i>) that encodes an enzyme that converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway. Many enzymes in this pathway are known to be involved in stress responses. The <i>nic3</i> mutants display hypersensitivity to ABA, whereas overexpression of <i>NIC3</i> restores normal ABA responses. Our data suggest that <i>NIC3</i> is responsive to ABA but requires ROS1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> demethylation at the promoter as a prerequisite to transcriptional activation. These findings suggest that ROS1-induced active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> demethylation maintains the active state of <i>NIC3</i> transcription in response to ABA.</p>

DDM1 Represses Noncoding RNA Expression and RNA-Directed DNA Methylation in Heterochromatin
<p>C methylation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>, which occurs at CG, CHG, and CHH (H = A, C, or T) sequences in plants, is a hallmark for the epigenetic repression of repetitive sequences. The chromatin-remodeling factor DECREASE IN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> METHYLATION1 (DDM1) is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> methylation, especially at CG and CHG sequences. However, its potential roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-directed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> methylation (RdDM) and in chromatin function are not completely understood in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). In this work, we used high-throughput approaches to study the function of rice DDM1 (OsDDM1) in RdDM and the expression of noncoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>. We show that loss of function of OsDDM1 results in ectopic CHH methylation of transposable elements and repeats. The ectopic CHH methylation was dependent on rice DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE2, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> methyltransferase involved in RdDM. Mutations in <i>OsDDM1</i> lead to decreases of histone H3K9me2 and increases in the levels of heterochromatic small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> and long noncoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>. In particular, OsDDM1 was found to be essential to repress the transcription of the two repetitive sequences, Centromeric Retrotransposons of Rice1 and the dominant centromeric CentO repeats. These results suggest that OsDDM1 antagonizes RdDM at heterochromatin and represses the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong>-specific expression of noncoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> from repetitive sequences in the rice genome.</p>

Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mesophyll</span></strong> conductance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and water use efficiencies. To improve water use efficiency, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mesophyll</span></strong> conductance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mesophyll</span></strong> conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mesophyll</span></strong> conductance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mesophyll</span></strong> conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mesophyll</span></strong> conductance is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive correlation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mesophyll</span></strong> and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mesophyll</span></strong> conductance and water use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mesophyll</span></strong> conductance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mesophyll</span></strong> conductance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mesophyll</span></strong> conductance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing water use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal conductance.</p>

Specifically, gene expression indicative of progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> differentiation is disrupted and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> transcription is globally reduced. Ssrp1a-deficient embryos exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> synthesis defects and prolonged S phase, uncovering a role distinct from that of Spt16, which promotes G<sub>1</sub> phase progression. Gene deletion/replacement experiments in <i>Drosophila</i> show that Ssrp1b, Ssrp1a and N-terminal Ssrp1a, equivalent to the yeast homologue Pob3, can substitute <i>Drosophila</i> Ssrp function. These data suggest that (1) Ssrp1b does not compensate for Ssrp1a loss in the zebrafish embryo, probably owing to insufficient expression levels, and (2) despite fundamental structural differences, the mechanisms mediating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> accessibility by FACT are conserved between yeast and metazoans. We propose that the essential functions of Ssrp1a in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> replication and gene transcription, together with its dynamic spatiotemporal expression, ensure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>-specific differentiation and proportional growth, which are crucial for the forming embryo.</p>

Structures and operating principles of the replisome
<p>Visualization in atomic detail of the replisome that performs concerted leading– and lagging–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> strand synthesis at a replication fork has not been reported. Using bacteriophage T7 as a model system, we determined cryo–electron microscopy structures up to 3.2-angstroms resolution of helicase translocating along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> and of helicase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong>-primase complexes engaging in synthesis of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> strands. Each domain of the spiral-shaped hexameric helicase translocates sequentially hand-over-hand along a single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> coil, akin to the way AAA+ ATPases (adenosine triphosphatases) unfold peptides. Two lagging-strand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong>s are attached to the primase, ready for Okazaki fragment synthesis in tandem. A β hairpin from the leading-strand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong> separates two parental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> strands into a T-shaped fork, thus enabling the closely coupled helicase to advance perpendicular to the downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> duplex. These structures reveal the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization and operating principles of a replisome.</p>

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins
<p>Prion-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP43 and FUS are largely soluble in the nucleus but form solid pathological aggregates when mislocalized to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>. What keeps these proteins soluble in the nucleus and promotes aggregation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong> is still unknown. We report here that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> critically regulates the phase behavior of prion-like RBPs. Low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>/protein ratios promote phase separation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> levels or genetic ablation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> binding causes excessive phase separation and the formation of cytotoxic solid-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> concentrations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> levels or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.</p>

CRISPR-Cas12a target binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity
<p>CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) proteins are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-guided enzymes that bind and cut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> as components of bacterial adaptive immune systems. Like CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a has been harnessed for genome editing on the basis of its ability to generate targeted, double-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> breaks. Here we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-guided <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> (ss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>) cleavage activity by Cas12a that completely degrades ss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> molecules. We find that target-activated, nonspecific single-stranded deoxyribonuclease (ss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>se) cleavage is also a property of other type V CRISPR-Cas12 enzymes. By combining Cas12a ss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>se activation with isothermal amplification, we create a method termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR), which achieves attomolar sensitivity for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> detection. DETECTR enables rapid and specific detection of human papilloma<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in patient samples, thereby providing a simple platform for molecular diagnostics.</p>

Architecture of a transcribing-translating expressome

The [4Fe4S] cluster of human DNA primase functions as a redox switch using DNA charge transport
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> charge transport chemistry offers a means of long-range, rapid redox signaling. We demonstrate that the [4Fe4S] cluster in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> primase can make use of this chemistry to coordinate the first steps of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> synthesis. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> electrochemistry, we found that a change in oxidation state of the [4Fe4S] cluster acts as a switch for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> binding. Single-atom mutations that inhibit this charge transfer hinder primase initiation without affecting primase structure or polymerization. Generating a single base mismatch in the growing primer duplex, which attenuates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> charge transport, inhibits primer truncation. Thus, redox signaling by [4Fe4S] clusters using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> charge transport regulates primase binding to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> and illustrates chemistry that may efficiently drive substrate handoff between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong>s during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> replication.</p>

Sucrose Nonfermenting 1-Related Protein Kinase 1 Phosphorylates a Geminivirus Rep Protein to Impair Viral Replication and Infection
<p>Gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es that infect a wide variety of plants and cause severe crop losses worldwide. The gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication initiator protein (Rep) binds to the viral replication origin and catalyzes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> cleavage and ligation to initiate rolling circle replication. In this study, we found that the <i>Tomato golden mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (TGMV) Rep is phosphorylated at serine-97 by sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1), a master regulator of plant energy homeostasis and metabolism. Phosphorylation of Rep or the phosphomimic S97D mutation impaired Rep binding to viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>. A TGMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>-A replicon containing the Rep S97D mutation replicated less efficiently in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) protoplasts than in wild-type or Rep phosphorylation-deficient replicons. The TGMV Rep-S97D mutant also was less infectious than the wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and was unable to infect tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). Nearly all gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> Rep proteins have a serine residue at the position equivalent to TGMV Rep serine-97. SnRK1 phosphorylated the equivalent serines in the Rep proteins of <i>Tomato mottle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> and <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> binding, suggesting that SnRK1 plays a key role in combating gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> infection. These results established that SnRK1 phosphorylates Rep and interferes with gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication and infection, underscoring the emerging role for SnRK1 in the host defense response against plant pathogens.</p>

Identification of a New Host Factor Required for Antiviral RNAi and Amplification of Viral siRNAs

We have recently performed a sensitized genetic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and identified two related phospholipid flippases required for antiviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>i and the amplification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-derived si<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s by plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong>1 (RDR1) and RDR6. Here we report the identification and cloning of <i>ANTIVIRAL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>I</i>-<i>DEFECTIVE2</i> (<i>AVI2</i>) from the same genetic screen. <i>AVI2</i> encodes a multispan transmembrane protein broadly conserved in plants and animals with two homologous human proteins known as magnesium transporters. We show that <i>avi2</i> mutant plants display no developmental defects and develop severe disease symptoms after infection with a mutant <i>Cucumber mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (CMV) defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>i suppression. <i>AVI2</i> is induced by CMV infection, particularly in veins, and is required for antiviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>i and RDR6-dependent biogenesis of viral si<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s. AVI2 is also necessary for Dicer-like2-mediated amplification of 22-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotide</span></strong> viral si<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s induced in <i>dcl4</i> mutant plants by infection, but dispensable for RDR6-dependent biogenesis of endogenous transacting si<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s. Further genetic studies illustrate that AVI2 plays a partially redundant role with AVI2H, the most closely related member in the <i>AVI2</i> gene family, in RDR1-dependent biogenesis of viral si<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s and the endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-activated si<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s (vasi-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s). Interestingly, we discovered a specific genetic interaction of AVI2 with AVI1 flippase that is critical for plant development.

Function of the Plant DNA Polymerase Epsilon in Replicative Stress Sensing, a Genetic Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Faithful transmission of the genetic information is essential in all living <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>isms. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> replication is therefore a critical step of cell proliferation, because of the potential occurrence of replication errors or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> damage when progression of a replication fork is hampered causing replicative stress. Like other types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> damage, replicative stress activates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> damage response, a signaling cascade allowing cell cycle arrest and repair of lesions. The replicative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong> ε (Pol ε) was shown to activate the S-phase checkpoint in yeast in response to replicative stress, but whether this mechanism functions in multicellular eukaryotes remains unclear. Here, we explored the genetic interaction between Pol ε and the main elements of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> damage response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that mutations affecting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong> domain of Pol ε trigger ATR-dependent signaling leading to SOG1 activation, WEE1-dependent cell cycle inhibition, and tolerance to replicative stress induced by hydroxyurea, but result in enhanced sensitivity to a wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> damaging agents. Using knock-down lines, we also provide evidence for the direct role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing. Together, our results demonstrate that the role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing is conserved in plants, and provide, to our knowledge, the first genetic dissection of the downstream signaling events in a multicellular eukaryote.</p>

A target to suppress inflammation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong>s that are stressed by injury or by invading pathogens elicit signals for the recruitment of inflammatory immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, which consequently release reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) as part of the innate immune response (<i>1</i>). This flood of RONS is important for directly attacking invading pathogens and for warding off infection of damaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong>. But the efficiency of RONS in inactivating invading cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es creates an Achilles heel of the innate immune response, namely that RONS are also able to kill and mutate cells in healthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong>s. Although inflammatory responses are usually counterbalanced over time by an opposing anti-inflammatory response, achieving the optimal balance with minimal collateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong> damage is difficult even in healthy individuals, and virtually impossible in individuals with certain disease conditions such as ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis (<i>2</i>). Therefore, the development of anti-inflammatory drugs, targeting inflammation from a variety of different angles, has flourished in recent decades. On page 834 of this issue, Visnes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) present an entirely new approach to suppressing the inflammatory response. Counter-intuitively, this approach involves the inhibition of the 8-oxoguanine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> glycosylase 1 (OGG1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> repair enzyme that recognizes and initiates the base excision repair of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), one of the major types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> base damage induced by RONS.</p>

mRNA structure determines specificity of a polyQ-driven phase separation

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate immunity, a large part of which consists of one type of immune cell—the neutrophil. Neutrophils form the largest group of immune cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> neutrophils daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of toxic chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another neutrophil defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying neutrophils mix their nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> with toxic components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in the surrounding environment. This process is called NETosis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying genetic information, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this immobilization on NETs, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cytotoxic molecules on the NET-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> complex. However, free extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming immune complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of NETs has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>ses) [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>se1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>se1-like 3 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>se1L3)], which cleave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> and together degrade freshly formed NETs. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal immunopathologies such as thrombus-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> failure.</p>

Generation of influenza A viruses as live but replication-incompetent virus vaccines
<p>The conversion of life-threatening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es into live but avirulent vaccines represents a revolution in vaccinology.

This generated premature termination <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong> (PTC)–harboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es that exerted full infectivity but were replication-incompetent in conventional cells.

The Helicase-Like Domains of Type III Restriction Enzymes Trigger Long-Range Diffusion Along DNA
<sec><title>Sliding Restriction</title><p>Helicase enzymes access the genetic information stored in double-helical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> by opening the individual strands.

The AAA-ATPase MIDASIN 1 Functions in Ribosome Biogenesis and Is Essential for Embryo and Root Development
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> biogenesis is an orchestrated process that relies on many assembly factors. The AAA-ATPase Midasin 1 (Mdn1) functions as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> assembly factor in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>), but the roles of MDN1 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we showed that the Arabidopsis null mutant of <i>MDN1</i> is embryo-lethal. Using the weak mutant <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i>, which maintains viability, we found that MDN1 is critical for the regular pattern of auxin maxima in the globular embryo and functions in root meristem maintenance. By detecting the subcellular distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> proteins, we noted that <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> impairs nuclear export of the pre-60S ribosomal particle. The processing of ribosomal precusor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s, including 35S, 27SB, and 20S, is also affected in this mutant. MDN1 physically interacts with PESCADILLO2 (PES2), an essential assembly factor of the 60S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong>, and the observed mislocalization of PES2 in <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> further implied that MDN1 plays an indispensable role in 60S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> biogenesis. Therefore, the observed hypersensitivity of <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> to a eukaryotic translation inhibitor and high-sugar conditions might be associated with the defect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> biogenesis. Overall, this work establishes a role of Arabidopsis MDN1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> biogenesis, which agrees with its roles in embryogenesis and root development.</p>

Selective Targeting of Mobile mRNAs to Plasmodesmata for Cell-to-Cell Movement
<p>Many plant m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s move from cell to cell or long distance to execute non-cell-autonomous functions. These mobile m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s traffic through the phloem to regulate many developmental processes, but despite the burgeoning discovery of mobile m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s, little is known about the mechanism underlying the intracellular sorting of these m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s. Here, we exploited a fluorescence-based m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> labeling system, using the bacteriophage coat protein MS2, fused to GFP (MS2-GFP) and an MS2 recognition site in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> of interest, to visualize the intracellular trafficking of mobile m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s in living plant cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We first improved this system by using the nuclear localization sequence from FD, which substantially reduced the fluorescent background of MS2-GFP in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>. The modified system allowed us to observe the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic fluorescent foci dependent on MS2-binding sites. Coexpressing the MS2-GFP system with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> movement protein, which is a plasmodesmata (PD)-localized nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-binding protein, targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic fluorescent foci to the PD, suggesting that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic fluorescent foci contain m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> and MS2-GFP. Our ex vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> imaging revealed that mobile but not nonmobile m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s were selectively targeted to PD. Real-time images of intracellular translocation revealed that the translocation of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>elle</span></strong>s in the transvacuolar strands may be governed by the same mechanism. Our study suggests that PD targeting of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> is a selective step in determining m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> cell-to-cell movement of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s.</p>

ALY RNA-Binding Proteins Are Required for Nucleocytosolic mRNA Transport and Modulate Plant Growth and Development
<p>The regulated transport of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s from the cell nucleus to the cytosol is a critical step linking transcript synthesis and processing with translation. However, in plants, only a few of the factors that act in the m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> export pathway have been functionally characterized. Flowering plant genomes encode several members of the ALY protein family, which function as m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> export factors in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>isms. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ALY1 to ALY4 are commonly detected in root and leaf cells, but they are differentially expressed in reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong>. Moreover, the subnuclear distribution of ALY1/2 differs from that of ALY3/4. ALY1 binds with higher affinity to single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> than double-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> and single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> and interacts preferentially with 5-methylcytosine-modified single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>. Compared with the full-length protein, the individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> recognition motif of ALY1 binds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> only weakly. ALY proteins interact with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> helicase UAP56, indicating a link to the m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> export machinery. Consistently, ALY1 complements the lethal phenotype of yeast cells lacking the ALY1 ortholog Yra1. Whereas individual <i>aly</i> mutants have a wild-type appearance, disruption of <i>ALY1</i> to <i>ALY4</i> in <i>4xaly</i> plants causes vegetative and reproductive defects, including strongly reduced growth, altered flower morphology, as well as abnormal ovules and female gametophytes, causing reduced seed production. Moreover, polyadenylated m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s accumulate in the nuclei of <i>4xaly</i> cells. Our results highlight the requirement of efficient m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> nucleocytosolic transport for proper plant growth and development and indicate that ALY1 to ALY4 act partly redundantly in this process; however, differences in expression and subnuclear localization suggest distinct functions.</p>

Three-Dimensional Analysis of Chloroplast Structures Associated with Virus Infection
<p>Chloroplasts are multifunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>elle</span></strong>s whose morphology is affected by environmental stresses. Although the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of thylakoid membranes has been reported previously, a 3D visualization of chloroplast under stress has not been explored. In this work, we used a positive-strand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> ((+)<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, barley stripe mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (BSMV) to observe chloroplast structural changes during infection by electron tomography. The analyses revealed remodeling of the chloroplast membranes, characterized by the clustering of outer membrane-invaginated spherules in inner membrane-derived packets. Diverse morphologies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic invaginations (CIs) were evident with spherules at the periphery and different sized openings connecting the CIs to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>. Immunoelectron microscopy of these viral components verified that the aberrant membrane structures were sites for BSMV replication. The BSMV αa replication protein localized at the surface of the chloroplasts and played a prominent role in eliciting chloroplast membrane rearrangements. In sum, our results have revealed the 3D structure of the chloroplasts induced by BSMV infection. These findings contribute to our understanding of chloroplast morphological changes under stress conditions and during assembly of plant (+)<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication complexes.</p>

Nuclear Transcriptomes at High Resolution Using Retooled INTACT
<p>Isolated nuclei provide access to early steps in gene regulation involving chromatin as well as transcript production and processing. Here, we describe transfer of the isolation of nuclei from tagged specific cell types (INTACT) to the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.). The purification of biotinylated nuclei was redesigned by replacing the outer nuclear-envelope-targeting domain of the nuclear tagging fusion (NTF) protein with an outer nuclear-envelope-anchored domain. This modified NTF was combined with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">codon</span></strong>-optimized <i>Escherichia coli BirA</i> in a single T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> construct. We also developed inexpensive methods for INTACT, T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> insertion mapping, and profiling of the complete nuclear transcriptome, including a ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> degradation procedure that minimizes pre-ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> (pre-r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>) transcripts.

The RNA Editing Factor SlORRM4 Is Required for Normal Fruit Ripening in Tomato
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> editing plays a key posttranscriptional role in gene expression. Existing studies on cytidine-to-uridine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> editing in plants have focused on maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the importance and regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> editing in several critical agronomic processes are not well understood, a notable example of which is fruit ripening. Here, we analyzed the expression profile of 33 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> editing factors and identified 11 putative tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) fruit ripening-related factors. A rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced gene silencing assay indicated that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>elle</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> recognition motif-containing protein SlORRM4 affected tomato fruit ripening. Knocking out SlORRM4 expression using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome editing strategy delayed tomato fruit ripening by lowering respiratory rate and ethylene production. Additionally, the expression of numerous genes associated with fruit ripening and mitochondrial functions changed significantly when <i>SlORRM4</i> was knocked out. Moreover, the loss of <i>SlORRM4</i> function significantly reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> editing of many mitochondrial transcripts, leading to low-level expression of some core subunits that are critical for mitochondrial complex assembly (i.e. Nad3, Cytc1, and COX II). Taken together, these results indicate that SlORRM4 is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> editing of transcripts in ripening fruit that influence mitochondrial function and key aspects of fruit ripening.</p>

An Organelle RNA Recognition Motif Protein Is Required for Photosystem II Subunit <i>psbF</i> Transcript Editing
<p>Loss-of-function mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ELLE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> RECOGNITION MOTIF PROTEIN6 (ORRM6) result in the near absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> editing of <i>psbF</i>-C77 and the reduction in <i>accD</i>-C794 editing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The <i>orrm6</i> mutants have decreased levels of photosystem II (PSII) proteins, especially PsbF, lower PSII activity, pale green pigmentation, smaller leaf and plant sizes, and retarded growth. Stable expression of <i>ORRM6</i> rescues the <i>orrm6</i> editing defects and mutant phenotype. Unlike ORRM1, the other known ORRM plastid editing factor, ORRM6, does not contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> editing interacting protein/multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> editing factor (RIP/MORF) boxes, which are required for ORRM1 to interact with site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein editing factors. ORRM6 interacts with RIP1/MORF8, RIP2/MORF2, and RIP9/MORF9, known components of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> editosomes. While some plastid RRM proteins are involved in other forms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> processing and translation, the primary function of ORRM6 is evidently to mediate <i>psbF</i>-C77 editing, like the essential site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein LOW PSII ACCUMULATION66. Stable expression in the <i>orrm6</i> mutants of a nucleus-encoded, plastid-targeted PsbF protein from a <i>psbF</i> gene carrying a T at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotide</span></strong> 77 significantly increases leaf and plant sizes, chlorophyll content, and PSII activity. These transformants demonstrate that plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> editing can be bypassed through the expression of nucleus-encoded, edited forms of plastid genes.</p>

DNA Topoisomerase Iα Affects the Floral Transition
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> topoisomerases modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> topology to maintain chromosome superstructure and genome integrity, which is indispensable for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> replication and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> transcription. Their function in plant development still remains largely unknown. Here, we report a hitherto unidentified role of Topoisomerase Iα (TOP1α) in controlling flowering time in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Loss of function of <i>TOP1α</i> results in early flowering under both long and short days. This is attributed mainly to a decrease in the expression of a central flowering repressor, <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>), and its close homologs, <i>MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING4</i> (<i>MAF4</i>) and <i>MAF5</i>, during the floral transition. TOP1α physically binds to the genomic regions of <i>FLC</i>, <i>MAF4</i>, and <i>MAF5</i> and promotes the association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong> II complexes to their transcriptional start sites. These correlate with the changes in histone modifications but do not directly affect nucleosome occupancy at these loci. Our results suggest that TOP1α mediates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> topology to facilitate the recruitment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong> II at <i>FLC</i>, <i>MAF4</i>, and <i>MAF5</i> in conjunction with histone modifications, thus facilitating the expression of these key flowering repressors to prevent precocious flowering in Arabidopsis.</p>

Scaling morphogen gradients during tissue growth by a cell division rule
<p>Morphogen gradients guide the patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s during the development of multicellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>isms. In many cases, morphogen signaling is also required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong> growth. The consequences of this interplay between growth and patterning are not well understood. In the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal disc, the morphogen Dpp guides patterning and is also required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong> growth. In particular, it was recently reported that cell division in the disc correlates with the temporal increase in Dpp signaling. Here we mathematically model morphogen gradient formation in a growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong>, accounting also for morphogen advection and dilution. Our analysis defines a new scaling mechanism, which we term the morphogen-dependent division rule (MDDR): when cell division depends on the temporal increase in morphogen signaling, the morphogen gradient scales with the growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong> size, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong> growth becomes spatially uniform and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong> naturally attains a finite size. This model is consistent with many properties of the wing disc. However, we find that the MDDR is not consistent with the phenotype of scaling-defective mutants, supporting the view that temporal increase in Dpp signaling is not the driver of cell division during late phases of disc development. More generally, our results show that local coupling of cell division with morphogen signaling can lead to gradient scaling and uniform growth even in the absence of global feedbacks. The MDDR scaling mechanism might be particularly beneficial during rapid proliferation, when global feedbacks are hard to implement.</p>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap junction remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong> samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis.

Structure of the complete elongation complex of RNA polymerase II with basal factors
<p>In the early stage of transcription, eukaryotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong> II (Pol II) exchanges initiation factors with elongation factors to form an elongation complex for processive transcription.

We also present a 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of a late-initiation intermediate harboring a rotationally unconstrained downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> duplex within the open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>P active site cleft. Our findings explain how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>P thermal motions control the promoter search and drive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> melting in the absence of exte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>l energy sources.</p>

Self-assembly of genetically encoded DNA-protein hybrid nanoscale shapes
<p>We describe an approach to bottom-up fabrication that allows integration of the functional diversity of proteins into designed three-dimensional structural frameworks. A set of custom staple proteins based on transcription activator–like effector proteins folds a double-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> template into a user-defined shape. Each staple protein is designed to recognize and closely link two distinct double-helical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> sequences at separate positions on the template. We present design rules for constructing megadalton-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>-protein hybrid shapes; introduce various structural motifs, such as custom curvature, corners, and vertices; and describe principles for creating multilayer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>-protein objects with enhanced rigidity. We demonstrate self-assembly of our hybrid nanostructures in one-pot mixtures that include the genetic information for the designed proteins, the template <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong>s, and cofactors for transcription and translation.</p>

The cryo-EM structure of a ribosome–Ski2-Ski3-Ski8 helicase complex
<p>Ski2-Ski3-Ski8 (Ski) is a helicase complex functioning with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-degrading exosome to mediate the 3′-5′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">messenger</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> (m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>) decay in turnover and quality-control pathways. We report that the Ski complex directly associates with 80<i>S</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong>s presenting a short m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> 3′ overhang. We determined the structure of an endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong>-Ski complex using cryo–electron microscopy (EM) with a local resolution of the Ski complex ranging from 4 angstroms (Å) in the core to about 10 Å for intrinsically flexible regions. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> binding displaces the autoinhibitory domain of the Ski2 helicase, positioning it in an open conformation near the ribosomal m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> entry tunnel. We observe that the m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> 3′ overhang is threaded directly from the small ribosomal subunit to the helicase channel of Ski2, primed for ongoing exosome-mediated 3′-5′ degradation.</p>

Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are spread from plant to plant by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es manipulate the release of plant volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on plants infected with these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (CMV) and one of its host plants, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>i 2b protein in CMV, plants infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong>s. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected plants engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Therefore, the frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> acquisition and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected plants than on CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected plants. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy plants infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced tobacco plants, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>i protein to increase plant ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

SMALL AUXIN UP RNA62/75 Are Required for the Translation of Transcripts Essential for Pollen Tube Growth
<p>Successful pollen tube elongation is critical for double fertilization, but the biological functions of pollen tube genes and the regulatory machinery underlying this crucial process are largely unknown. A previous translatomic study revealed two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAUR</i> (<i>SMALL AUXIN UP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong></i>) genes, <i>SAUR62</i> and <i>SAUR75</i>, whose expression is up-regulated by pollination. Here, we found that both SAUR62 and SAUR75 localized mainly to pollen tube nuclei. The siliques of homozygous <i>saur62</i> (<i>saur62/−</i>), <i>saur75</i> (<i>saur75/−</i>), and the <i>SAUR62</i>/<i>75</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> interference (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>i) knockdown line had many aborted seeds. These lines had normal pollen viability but defective in vitro and in vivo pollen tube growth, with branching phenotypes. Immunoprecipitation with transgenic SAUR62/75-GFP flowers revealed ribosomal protein RPL12 family members as potential interacting partners, and their individual interactions were confirmed further by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Polysome profiling showed reduced 80S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> abundance in homozygous <i>saur62</i>, <i>saur75</i>, <i>ribosomal large subunit12c</i>, and <i>SAUR62/75</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>i flowers, suggesting that SAUR62/75 play roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosome</span></strong> assembly. To clarify their roles in translation, we analyzed total proteins from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>i versus wild-type flowers by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, revealing significantly reduced expression of factors participating in pollen tube wall biogenesis and F-actin dynamics, which are critical for the elastic properties of tube elongation. Indeed, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>i pollen tubes showed mislocalization of deesterified and esterified pectins and F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization. Thus, the biological roles of SAUR62/75 and their RPL12 partners are critical in ribosomal pre-60S subunit assembly for efficient pollen tube elongation and subsequent fertilization.</p>

<i>Foxtail mosaic virus</i>: A Viral Vector for Protein Expression in Cereals
<p>Rapid and cost-effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-derived transient expression systems for plants are invaluable in elucidating gene function and are particularly useful in plant species for which transformation-based methods are unavailable or are too time and labor demanding, such as wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-mediated overexpression (VOX) vectors based on <i>Barley stripe mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> and <i>Wheat streak mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> described previously for these species are incapable of expressing free recombinant proteins of more than 150 to 250 amino acids, are not suited for high-throughput screens, and have other limitations. In this study, we report the development of a VOX vector based on a monopartite single-stranded positive sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, <i>Foxtail mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (genus <i>Potex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i>). In this vector, PV101, the gene of interest was inserted downstream of the duplicated subgenomic promoter of the viral coat protein gene, and the corresponding protein was expressed in its free form. The vector allowed the expression of a 239-amino acid-long GFP in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-inoculated and upper uninoculated (systemic) leaves of wheat and maize and directed the systemic expression of a larger approximately 600-amino acid protein, GUSPlus, in maize. Moreover, we demonstrated that PV101 can be used for in planta expression and functional analysis of apoplastic pathogen effector proteins such as the host-specific toxin ToxA of <i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i>. Therefore, this VOX vector opens possibilities for functional genomics studies in two important cereal crops.</p>

Transcription Factor OsTGA10 Is a Target of the MADS Protein OsMADS8 and Is Required for Tapetum Development
<p>This study aimed at elucidating regulatory components behind floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> identity determination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong> development. It remains unclear how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> identity proteins facilitate development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> primordia into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue</span></strong>s with a determined identity, even though it has long been accepted that floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> identity is genetically determined by interaction of identity genes according to the ABC model. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing technique, we identified <i>OsTGA10</i>, encoding a bZIP transcription factor, as a target of the MADS box protein OsMADS8, which is annotated as an E-class <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> identity protein. We characterized the function of OsTGA10 using genetic and molecular analyses. <i>OsTGA10</i> was preferentially expressed during stamen development, and mutation of <i>OsTGA10</i> resulted in male sterility. OsTGA10 was required for tapetum development and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes. In addition, in <i>ostga10</i> stamens, the hallmark cell wall thickening of the endothecium was defective. Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> identity determination and tapetum development in rice stamen development, between tapetum development and microspore development, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum development. Furthermore, the defective endothecium in <i>ostga10</i> implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum development.</p>

Turnip Mosaic Virus Counteracts Selective Autophagy of the Viral Silencing Suppressor HCpro<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway and has emerged as a key mechanism of antiviral immunity in metazoans, including the selective elimination of viral components. In turn, some animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are able to escape and modulate autophagy for enhanced pathogenicity. Whether host autophagic responses and viral countermeasures play similar roles in plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> interactions is not well understood. Here, we have identified selective autophagy as antiviral pathway during plant infection with turnip mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (TuMV), a positive-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> poty<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>. We show that the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 suppresses viral accumulation by targeting the viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> silencing suppressor helper-component proteinase (HCpro), presumably in association with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> granules. Intriguingly, TuMV seems to antagonize NBR1-dependent autophagy during infection by the activity of distinct viral proteins, thereby limiting its antiviral capacity. We also found that NBR1-independent bulk autophagy prevents premature plant death, thus extending the lifespan of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> reservoirs and particle production. Together, our study highlights a conserved role of selective autophagy in antiviral immunity and suggests the evolvement of viral protein functions to inhibit autophagy processes, despite a potential trade-off in host survival.</p>

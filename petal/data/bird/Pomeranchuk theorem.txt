Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlations enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “coherent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon interactions.</p>

Full momentum- and energy-resolved spectral function of a 2D electronic system
<p>The single-particle spectral function measures the density of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic states in a material as a function of both momentum and energy, providing central insights into strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> phenomena. Here we demonstrate a high-resolution method for measuring the full momentum- and energy-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic spectral function of a two-dimensional (2D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic system embedded in a semiconductor. The technique remains operational in the presence of large externally applied magnetic fields and functions even for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic systems with zero electrical conductivity or with zero <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> density. Using the technique on a prototypical 2D system, a GaAs quantum well, we uncover signatures of many-body effects involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon interactions, plasmons, polarons, and a phonon analog of the vacuum Rabi splitting in atomic systems.</p>

Electron-scale dynamics of the diffusion region during symmetric magnetic reconnection in space
<p>Magnetic reconnection is an energy conversion process that occurs in many astrophysical contexts including Earth’s magnetosphere, where the process can be investigated in situ by spacecraft. On 11 July 2017, the four Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft encountered a reconnection site in Earth’s magnetotail, where reconnection involves symmetric inflow conditions. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-scale plasma measurements revealed (i) super-Alfvénic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> jets reaching 15,000 kilometers per second; (ii) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> meandering motion and acceleration by the electric field, producing multiple crescent-shaped structures in the velocity distributions; and (iii) the spatial dimensions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> diffusion region with an aspect ratio of 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with fast reconnection. The well-structured multiple layers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> populations indicate that the dominant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> dynamics are mostly laminar, despite the presence of turbulence near the reconnection site.</p>

Imaging of nonlocal hot-electron energy dissipation via shot noise
<p>In modern micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic devices, hot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s accelerate, scatter, and dissipate energy in nanoscale dimensions. Despite recent progress in nanothermometry, direct real-space mapping of hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> energy dissipation is challenging because existing techniques are restricted to probing the lattice rather than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s. We realize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic nanothermometry by measuring local current fluctuations, or shot noise, associated with ultrafast hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> kinetic processes (~21 terahertz). Exploiting a scanning and contact-free tungsten tip as a local noise probe, we directly visualize hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> distributions before their thermal equilibration with the host gallium arsenide/aluminium gallium arsenide crystal lattice. With nanoconstriction devices, we reveal unexpected nonlocal energy dissipation at room temperature, which is reminiscent of ballistic transport of low-temperature quantum conductors.</p>

Tuning quantum nonlocal effects in graphene plasmonics
<p>The response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> systems to electrodynamic fields that change rapidly in space is endowed by unique features, including an exquisite spatial nonlocality. This can reveal much about the materials’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure that is invisible in standard probes that use gradually varying fields. Here, we use graphene plasmons, propagating at extremely slow velocities close to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> Fermi velocity, to probe the nonlocal response of the graphene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> liquid. The near-field imaging experiments reveal a parameter-free match with the full quantum description of the massless Dirac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> gas, which involves three types of nonlocal quantum effects: single-particle velocity matching, interaction-enhanced Fermi velocity, and interaction-reduced compressibility. Our experimental approach can determine the full spatiotemporal response of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> system.</p>

Ballistic miniband conduction in a graphene superlattice
<p>Rational design of long-period artificial lattices yields effects unavailable in simple solids. The moiré pattern in highly aligned graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures is a lateral superlattice with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> mobility and an unusual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic dispersion whose miniband edges and saddle points can be reached by electrostatic gating. We investigated the dynamics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s in moiré minibands by measuring ballistic transport between adjacent local contacts in a magnetic field, known as the transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> focusing effect. At low temperatures, we observed caustics of skipping orbits extending over hundreds of superlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive minibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities. At high temperatures, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> collisions suppress focusing. Probing such miniband conduction properties is a necessity for engineering novel transport behaviors in superlattice devices.</p>

The Impacts of Phosphorus Deficiency on the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain
<p>Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and P deficiency limits plant productivity. Recent work showed that P deficiency affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport to photosystem I (PSI), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive biological model describing how P deficiency disrupts the photosynthetic machinery and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport chain through a series of sequential events in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). P deficiency reduces the orthophosphate concentration in the chloroplast stroma to levels that inhibit ATP synthase activity. Consequently, protons accumulate in the thylakoids and cause lumen acidification, which inhibits linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow. Limited plastoquinol oxidation retards <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport to the cytochrome <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transfer rate of PSI is increased under steady-state growth light and is limited under high-light conditions. Under P deficiency, the enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow through PSI increases the levels of NADPH, whereas ATP production remains restricted and, hence, reduces CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. In parallel, lumen acidification activates the energy-dependent quenching component of the nonphotochemical quenching mechanism and prevents the overexcitation of photosystem II and damage to the leaf tissue. Consequently, plants can be severely affected by P deficiency for weeks without displaying any visual leaf symptoms. All of the processes in the photosynthetic machinery influenced by P deficiency appear to be fully reversible and can be restored in less than 60 min after resupply of orthophosphate to the leaf tissue.</p>

Signatures of exciton condensation in a transition metal dichalcogenide
<p>Bose condensation has shaped our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors, atomic gases, and liquid helium. Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to condense into either a superfluid or an insulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic crystal. Using the recently developed technique of momentum‐resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> energy‐loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic collective modes in the transition metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1<i>T</i>‐TiSe<sub>2</sub>. Near the phase-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of the valence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s into an exciton condensate. Our study provides compelling evidence for exciton condensation in a three-dimensional solid and establishes M-EELS as a versatile technique sensitive to valence band excitations in quantum materials.</p>

Attosecond-resolved photoionization of chiral molecules
<p>Chiral light-matter interactions have been investigated for two centuries, leading to the discovery of many chiroptical processes used for discrimination of enantiomers. Whereas most chiroptical effects result from a response of bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s, photoionization can produce much stronger chiral signals that manifest as asymmetries in the angular distribution of the photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s along the light-propagation axis. We implemented self-referenced attosecond photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> interferometry to measure the temporal profile of the forward and backward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets emitted upon photoionization of camphor by circularly polarized laser pulses. We measured a delay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s ejected forward and backward, which depends on the ejection angle and reaches 24 attoseconds. The asymmetric temporal shape of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets emitted through an autoionizing state further reveals the chiral character of strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic dynamics.</p>

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid
<p>Charge ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s in solids crystallize into a periodic pattern of charge-rich and charge-poor sites owing to strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In geometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic state without long-range CO has been observed. We found that a charge-ordered organic material with an isosceles triangular lattice shows charge dynamics associated with crystallization and vitrification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s, which can be understood in the context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO patterns. The dynamics suggest that the same nucleation and growth processes that characterize conventional glass-forming liquids guide the crystallization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s. These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of the liquid-glass transition.</p>

Electronic crystal growth

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The dynamics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of wave packets. However, the rapidity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> dynamics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets in the time domain. Using spectrally resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packet created through a Fano autoionizing resonance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference wave packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant wave packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing resonance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission dynamics governed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlation, as well as coherent control over structured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets.</p>

PGR5-Dependent Cyclic Electron Flow Protects Photosystem I under Fluctuating Light at Donor and Acceptor Sides
<p>In response to a sudden increase in light intensity, plants must cope with absorbed excess photon energy to protect photosystems from photodamage. Under fluctuating light, PSI is severely photodamaged in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>proton gradient regulation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutant defective in the main pathway of PSI cyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport (CET). Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed regulatory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) reservation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> sink capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH production ratio (acceptor-side regulation) and (2) down-regulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic control for slowing down the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow toward PSI (donor-side regulation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> backgrounds by introducing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hypersensitivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to luminal acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic control partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant background but restricted linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic control should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> sink and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic control. Thus, donor-side regulation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side regulation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side regulation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport and that an excess capacity for alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport.</p>

Rapid change of superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling through critical doping in Bi-2212
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-boson coupling plays a key role in superconductivity for many systems. However, in copper-based high–critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) superconductors, its relation to superconductivity remains controversial despite strong spectroscopic fingerprints. In this study, we used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to find a pronounced correlation between the superconducting gap and the bosonic coupling strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+δ</sub>. The bosonic coupling strength rapidly increases from the overdoped Fermi liquid regime to the optimally doped strange metal, concomitant with the quadrupled superconducting gap and the doubled gap-to-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ratio across the pseudogap boundary. This synchronized lattice and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic response suggests that the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic interaction and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling (EPC) reinforce each other in a positive-feedback loop upon entering the strange-metal regime, which in turn drives a stronger superconductivity.</p>

Bottom-up synthesis of multifunctional nanoporous graphene

Here we report a bottom-up method to synthesize nanoporous graphene comprising an ordered array of pores separated by ribbons, which can be tuned down to the 1-nanometer range. The size, density, morphology, and chemical composition of the pores are defined with atomic precision by the design of the molecular precursors.

Strong spin-photon coupling in silicon

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave photon is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator.

Enantioselective photochemistry through Lewis acid–catalyzed triplet energy transfer

We applied this strategy to asymmetric [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of 2′-hydroxychalcones, using tris(bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) as a sensitizer.

Glycolate Induces Redox Tuning Of Photosystem II in Vivo: Study of a Photorespiration Mutant
<p>Bicarbonate removal from the nonheme iron at the acceptor side of photosystem II (PSII) was shown recently to shift the midpoint potential of the primary quinone acceptor Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive potential and lowers the yield of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) production. The presence of Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> results in weaker binding of bicarbonate, suggesting a redox-based regulatory and protective mechanism where loss of bicarbonate or exchange of bicarbonate by other small carboxylic acids may protect PSII against <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in vivo under photorespiratory conditions. Here, we compared the properties of Q<sub>A</sub> in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) photorespiration mutant deficient in peroxisomal HYDROXYPYRUVATE REDUCTASE1 (<i>hpr1-1</i>), which accumulates glycolate in leaves, with the wild type. Photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport was affected in the mutant, and chlorophyll fluorescence showed slower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport between Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> in the mutant. Glycolate induced an increase in the temperature maximum of thermoluminescence emission, indicating a shift of the midpoint potential of Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive value. The yield of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production was lowered in thylakoid membranes isolated from <i>hpr1-1</i> compared with the wild type, consistent with a higher potential of Q<sub>A</sub>/Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup>. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> donation to photosystem I was affected in <i>hpr1-1</i> at higher light intensities, consistent with diminished <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transfer out of PSII. This study indicates that replacement of bicarbonate at the nonheme iron by a small carboxylate anion occurs in plants in vivo. These findings suggested that replacement of the bicarbonate on the nonheme iron by glycolate may represent a regulatory mechanism that protects PSII against photooxidative stress under low-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p>

Ferredoxin:NADP(H) Oxidoreductase Abundance and Location Influences Redox Poise and Stress Tolerance
<p>In linear photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport, ferredoxin:NADP(H) oxidoreductase (FNR) transfers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s from ferredoxin (Fd) to NADP<sup>+</sup>. Both NADPH and reduced Fd (Fd<sup>red</sup>) are required for reductive assimilation and light/dark activation/deactivation of enzymes. FNR is therefore a hub, connecting photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport to chloroplast redox metabolism. A correlation between FNR content and tolerance to oxidative stress is well established, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of altered FNR content and localization on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport and superoxide radical evolution in isolated thylakoids, and probed resulting changes in redox homeostasis, expression of oxidative stress markers, and tolerance to high light in planta. Our data indicate that the ratio of Fd<sup>red</sup> to FNR is critical, with either too much or too little FNR potentially leading to increased superoxide production, and perception of oxidative stress at the level of gene transcription. In FNR overexpressing plants, which show more NADP(H) and glutathione pools, improved tolerance to high-light stress indicates that disturbance of chloroplast redox poise and increased free radical generation may help “prime” the plant and induce protective mechanisms. In <i>fnr1</i> knock-outs, the NADP(H) and glutathione pools are more oxidized relative to the wild type, and the photoprotective effect is absent despite perception of oxidative stress at the level of gene transcription.</p>

The low-frequency source of Saturn’s kilometric radiation
<p>Understanding how auroral radio emissions are produced by magnetized bodies requires in situ measurements within their source region. Saturn’s kilometric radiation (SKR) has been widely used as a remote proxy of Saturn’s magnetosphere. We present wave and plasma measurements from the Cassini spacecraft during its ring-grazing high-inclination orbits, which passed three times through the high-altitude SKR emission region. Northern dawn-side, narrow-banded radio sources were encountered at frequencies of 10 to 20 kilohertz, within regions of upward currents mapping to the ultraviolet auroral oval. The kilometric waves were produced on the extraordinary mode by the cyclotron maser instability from 6– to 12–kilo–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> volt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> beams and radiated quasi-perpendicularly to the auroral magnetic field lines.

Origin of the bright photoluminescence of few-atom silver clusters confined in LTA zeolites
<p>Silver (Ag) clusters confined in matrices possess remarkable luminescence properties, but little is known about their structural and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic properties. We characterized the bright green luminescence of Ag clusters confined in partially exchanged Ag–Linde Type A (LTA) zeolites by means of a combination of x-ray excited optical luminescence-extended x-ray absorption fine structure, time-dependent–density functional theory calculations, and time-resolved spectroscopy. A mixture of tetrahedral Ag<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>x</sub></i><sup>2+</sup> (<i>x</i> = 2 and <i>x</i> = 4) clusters occupies the center of a fraction of the sodalite cages. Their optical properties originate from a confined two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> superatom quantum system with hybridized Ag and water O orbitals delocalized over the cluster. Upon excitation, one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> of the s-type highest occupied molecular orbital is promoted to the p-type lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals and relaxes through enhanced intersystem crossing into long-lived triplet states.</p>

Coherent band excitations in CePd<sub>3</sub>: A comparison of neutron scattering and ab initio theory
<p>In common with many strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> systems, intermediate valence compounds are believed to display a crossover from a high-temperature regime of incoherently fluctuating local moments to a low-temperature regime of coherent hybridized bands. We show that inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of CePd<sub>3</sub> provides a benchmark for ab initio calculations based on dynamical mean field theory. The magnetic response is strongly momentum dependent thanks to the formation of coherent f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> bands at low temperature, with an amplitude that is strongly enhanced by local particle-hole interactions. The agreement between experiment and theory shows that we have a robust first-principles understanding of the temperature dependence of f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> coherence.</p>

Imaging resonant dissipation from individual atomic defects in graphene
<p>Conversion of electric current into heat involves microscopic processes that operate on nanometer length scales and release minute amounts of power. Although central to our understanding of the electrical properties of materials, individual mediators of energy dissipation have so far eluded direct observation. Using scanning nanothermometry with submicrokelvin sensitivity, we visualized and controlled phonon emission from individual atomic-scale defects in graphene. The inferred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon “cooling power spectrum” exhibits sharp peaks when the Fermi level comes into resonance with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic quasi-bound states at such defects. Rare in the bulk but abundant at graphene’s edges, switchable atomic-scale phonon emitters provide the dominant dissipation mechanism. Our work offers insights for addressing key materials challenges in modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ics and enables control of dissipation at the nanoscale.</p>

Organocalcium-mediated nucleophilic alkylation of benzene

In contrast, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-rich π-system of benzene is highly resistant to reactions with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-rich and negatively charged organic nucleophiles. Here, we report that this previously insurmountable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic repulsion may be overcome through the use of sufficiently potent organocalcium nucleophiles. Calcium <i>n</i>-alkyl derivatives—synthesized by reaction of ethene, but-1-ene, and hex-1-ene with a dimeric calcium hydride—react with protio and deutero benzene at 60°C through nucleophilic substitution of an aromatic C–D/H bond. These reactions produce the <i>n-</i>alkyl benzenes with regeneration of the calcium hydride. Density functional theory calculations implicate an unstabilized Meisenheimer complex in the C–H activation transition state.</p>

Colloidally prepared La-doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> electrodes for efficient, photostable perovskite solar cells

Femtosecond x-ray spectroscopy of an electrocyclic ring-opening reaction
<p>The ultrafast light-activated electrocyclic ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a fundamental prototype of photochemical pericyclic reactions. Generally, these reactions are thought to proceed through an intermediate excited-state minimum (the so-called pericyclic minimum), which leads to isomerization via nonadiabatic relaxation to the ground state of the photoproduct. Here, we used femtosecond (fs) soft x-ray spectroscopy near the carbon K-edge (~284 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> volts) on a table-top apparatus to directly reveal the valence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure of this transient intermediate state. The core-to-valence spectroscopic signature of the pericyclic minimum observed in the experiment was characterized, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory calculations, to reveal overlap and mixing of the frontier valence orbital energy levels. We show that this transient valence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure arises within 60 ± 20 fs after ultraviolet photoexcitation and decays with a time constant of 110 ± 60 fs.</p>

Extremely efficient internal exciton dissociation through edge states in layered 2D perovskites

Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites are solution-processed quantum wells wherein the band gap can be tuned by varying the perovskite-layer thickness, which modulates the effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-hole confinement.

The methanogenic CO<sub>2</sub> reducing-and-fixing enzyme is bifunctional and contains 46 [4Fe-4S] clusters

CO<sub>2</sub> is first reduced to formate in FwdBD, which then diffuses through a 43-angstrom-long tunnel to FwdA, where it condenses with methanofuran to formyl-methanofuran.

Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s that can be transferred to the mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport chain via the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark respiration. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of respiration and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the respiration.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During oxygenic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow to oxygen, which drives most of the photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

The Liverwort, <i>Marchantia</i>, Drives Alternative Electron Flow Using a Flavodiiron Protein to Protect PSI
<p>The diffusion efficiency of oxygen in the atmosphere, like that of CO<sub>2</sub>, is approximately 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than that in aqueous environments. Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential oxidative damage. The liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, a basal land plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the atmosphere. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, <i>M. polymorpha</i> has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate oxygen-dependent alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow (AEF) to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protection of photosynthesis in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>) sustained photooxidative damage to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturation pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> showed the same photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate but a lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport rate during the induction phase of photosynthesis. Additionally, the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of <i>MpFlv1</i> drives AEF to oxidize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the production of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport in the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub>/<i>f</i> complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.</p>

Connecting the Molecular Structure of Cutin to Ultrastructure and Physical Properties of the Cuticle in Petals of Arabidopsis
<p>The plant cuticle is laid down at the cell wall surface of epidermal cells in a wide variety of structures, but the functional significance of this architectural diversity is not yet understood. Here, the structure-function relationship of the petal cuticle of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was investigated. Applying Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, the cutin mutants <i>long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetase2</i> (<i>lacs2</i>), <i>permeable cuticle1 (pec1)</i>, <i>cyp77a6</i>, <i>glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase6</i> (<i>gpat6</i>), and <i>defective in cuticular ridges</i> (<i>dcr</i>) were grouped in three separate classes based on quantitative differences in the ν(C=O) and ν(C-H) band vibrations. These were associated mainly with the quantity of 10,16-dihydroxy hexadecanoic acid, a monomer of the cuticle polyester, cutin. These spectral features were linked to three different types of cuticle organization: a normal cuticle with nanoridges (<i>lacs2</i> and <i>pec1</i> mutants); a broad translucent cuticle (<i>cyp77a6</i> and <i>dcr</i> mutants); and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-opaque multilayered cuticle (<i>gpat6</i> mutant). The latter two types did not have typical nanoridges. Transmission <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> microscopy revealed considerable variations in cuticle thickness in the <i>dcr</i> mutant. Different double mutant combinations showed that a low amount of C16 monomers in cutin leads to the appearance of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-translucent layer adjacent to the cuticle proper, which is independent of DCR action. We concluded that DCR is not only essential for incorporating 10,16-dihydroxy C16:0 into cutin but also plays a crucial role in the organization of the cuticle, independent of cutin composition. Further characterization of the mutant petals suggested that nanoridge formation and conical cell shape may contribute to the reduction of physical adhesion forces between petals and other floral organs during floral development.</p>

The NDH-1L-PSI Supercomplex Is Important for Efficient Cyclic Electron Transport in Cyanobacteria
<p>Two mutants isolated from a tagging library of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. strain PCC 6803 were sensitive to high light and had a tag in <i>sll1471</i> encoding CpcG2, a linker protein for photosystem I (PSI)-specific antenna. Both mutants demonstrated strongly impaired NDH-1-dependent cyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport. Blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analyses of the wild type and a mutant containing CpcG2 fused with yellow fluorescent protein-histidine6 indicated the presence of a novel NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex, which was absent in the <i>cpcG2</i> deletion mutant, the PSI-less mutant, and several other strains deficient in NDH-1L and/or NDH-1M. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down analyses on CpcG2-yellow fluorescent protein-histidine6, using antibody against green fluorescent protein and nickel column chromatography, confirmed the association of CpcG2 with the supercomplex. Conversely, the use of antibodies against NdhH or NdhK after blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in coimmunoprecipitation experiments verified the necessity of CpcG2 in stabilizing the supercomplex. Furthermore, deletion of CpcG2 destabilized NDH-1L as well as its degradation product NDH-1M and significantly decreased the number of functional PSI centers, consistent with the involvement of CpcG2 in NDH-1-dependent cyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport. The CpcG2 deletion, however, had no effect on respiration. Thus, we propose that the formation of an NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex in cyanobacteria facilitates PSI cyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport via NDH-1L.</p>

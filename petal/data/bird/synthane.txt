Methane production from coal by a single methanogen
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e is one of the largest unconventional natural gas resources. Although microbial activity may greatly contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e formation, it is unclear whether the complex aromatic organic compounds present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong> can be used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenesis. We show that deep subsurface–derived <i>Methermicoccus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogens can produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e from more than 30 types of methoxylated aromatic compounds (MACs) as well as from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>s containing MACs. In contrast to known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenesis pathways involving one- and two-carbon compounds, this “methoxydotrophic” mode of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenesis couples <i>O</i>-demethylation, CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, and possibly acetyl–coenzyme A metabolism. Because MACs derived from lignin may occur widely in subsurface sediments, methoxydotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenesis would play an important role in the formation of natural gas not limited to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e and in the global carbon cycle.</p>

Synthesis of FeH<sub>5</sub>: A layered structure with atomic hydrogen slabs
<p>High pressure promotes the formation of polyhydrides with unusually high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-to-metal ratios. These polyhydrides have complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>ic sublattices. We synthesized iron pentahydride (FeH<sub>5</sub>) by a direct reaction between iron and H<sub>2</sub> above 130 gigapascals in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. FeH<sub>5</sub> exhibits a structure built of atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> only. It consists of intercalated layers of quasicubic FeH<sub>3</sub> units and four-plane slabs of thin atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>. The distribution of the valence electron density indicates a bonding between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> and iron atoms but none between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> atoms, presenting a two-dimensional metallic character. The discovery of FeH<sub>5</sub> suggests a low-pressure path to make materials that approach bulk dense atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>.</p>

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes
<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a plume of material erupts from cracks in the ice. The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials. The relatively high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e from CO<sub>2</sub> in Enceladus’ ocean.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p>Metals that are active catalysts for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–melting temperature metals (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten metal alloy catalysts for pyrolysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> and carbon. All solid catalysts previously used for this reaction have been deactivated by carbon deposition. In the molten alloy system, the insoluble carbon floats to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi alloy achieved 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products. Calculations show that the active metals in the molten alloys are atomically dispersed and negatively charged. There is a correlation between the amount of charge on the atoms and their catalytic activity.</p>

Aqueous Au-Pd colloids catalyze selective CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation to CH<sub>3</sub>OH with O<sub>2</sub> under mild conditions
<p>The selective oxidation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e, the primary component of natural gas, remains an important challenge in catalysis. We used colloidal gold-palladium nanoparticles, rather than the same nanoparticles supported on titanium oxide, to oxidize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol with high selectivity (92%) in aqueous solution at mild temperatures. Then, using isotopically labeled oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as an oxidant in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>,</sub> we demonstrated that the resulting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol incorporated a substantial fraction (70%) of gas-phase O<sub>2</sub>. More oxygenated products were formed than the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> consumed, suggesting that the controlled breakdown of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e, which subsequently incorporates molecular oxygen through a radical process. If a source of methyl radicals can be established, then the selective oxidation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol using molecular oxygen is possible.</p>

Selective anaerobic oxidation of methane enables direct synthesis of methanol
<p>Direct functionalization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e in natural gas remains a key challenge. We present a direct stepwise method for converting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol with high selectivity (~97%) over a copper-containing zeolite, based on partial oxidation with water. The activation in helium at 673 kelvin (K), followed by consecutive catalyst exposures to 7 bars of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e and then water at 473 K, consistently produced 0.204 mole of CH<sub>3</sub>OH per mole of copper in zeolite. Isotopic labeling confirmed water as the source of oxygen to regenerate the zeolite active centers and renders <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol desorption energetically favorable. On the basis of in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we propose a mechanism involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e oxidation at Cu<sup>II</sup> oxide active centers, followed by Cu<sup>I</sup> reoxidation by water with concurrent formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>.</p>

Low-temperature activation of methane on the IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e undergoes highly facile C–H bond cleavage on the stoichiometric IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface. From temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy experiments, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e molecularly adsorbed as a strongly bound σ complex on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) and that a large fraction of the adsorbed complexes underwent C–H bond cleavage at temperatures as low as 150 kelvin (K). The initial dissociation probability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) decreased from 80 to 20% with increasing surface temperature from 175 to 300 K. We estimate that the activation energy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e C–H bond cleavage is 9.5 kilojoule per mole (kJ/mol) lower than the binding energy of the adsorbed precursor on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110), and equal to a value of ~28.5 kJ/mol. Low-temperature activation may avoid unwanted side reactions in the development of catalytic processes to selectively convert <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e to value-added products.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. Metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> becomes metallic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the atomic density. The properties are those of an atomic metal. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington dissociative transition to atomic metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> in the laboratory.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)
<sec><title>Vibrating Water Apart</title><p>The main route for producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> for industrial chemical synthesis is steam reforming, in which water and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e react at high temperatures on nickel catalysts to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon dioxid</span></strong>e.

Particulate methane monooxygenase contains only mononuclear copper centers

The nature of the copper active site in the primary metabolic enzyme of these bacteria, particulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e monooxygenase (pMMO), has been controversial owing to seemingly contradictory biochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic results. We present biochemical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic characterization most consistent with two monocopper sites within pMMO: one in the soluble PmoB subunit at the previously assigned active site (Cu<sub>B</sub>) and one ~2 nanometers away in the membrane-bound PmoC subunit (Cu<sub>C</sub>).

Selective functionalization of methane, ethane, and higher alkanes by cerium photocatalysis

High catalytic efficiency (turnover numbers up to 2900 for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e and 9700 for ethane) and selectivity were achieved using abundant, inexpensive cerium salts as photocatalysts. Ligand-to-metal charge transfer excitation generated alkoxy radicals from simple alcohols that in turn acted as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> atom transfer catalysts. The mixed-phase gas/liquid reaction was adapted to continuous flow, enabling the efficient use of gaseous feedstocks in scalable photocatalytic transformations.</p>

Direct observation of individual hydrogen atoms at trapping sites in a ferritic steel

Coordination-induced weakening of ammonia, water, and hydrazine X–H bonds in a molybdenum complex

Asymmetric nucleophilic fluorination under hydrogen bonding phase-transfer catalysis
<p>Common anionic nucleophiles such as those derived from inorganic salts have not been used for enantioselective catalysis because of their insolubility. Here, we report that merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bonding and phase-transfer catalysis provides an effective mode of activation for nucleophiles that are insoluble in organic solvents. This catalytic manifold relies on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bonding complexation to render nucleophiles soluble and reactive, while simultaneously inducing asymmetry in the ensuing transformation. We demonstrate the concept using a chiral bis-urea catalyst to form a tridentate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bonding complex with fluoride from its cesium salt, thereby enabling highly efficient enantioselective ring opening of episulfonium ion. This fluorination method is synthetically valuable considering the scarcity of alternative protocols and points the way to wider application of the catalytic approach with diverse anionic nucleophiles.</p>

Mechanically robust, readily repairable polymers via tailored noncovalent cross-linking
<p>Expanding the range of healable materials is an important challenge for sustainable societies. Noncrystalline, high-molecular-weight polymers generally form mechanically robust materials, which, however, are difficult to repair once they are fractured. This is because their polymer chains are heavily entangled and diffuse too sluggishly to unite fractured surfaces within reasonable time scales. Here we report that low-molecular-weight polymers, when cross-linked by dense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bonds, yield mechanically robust yet readily repairable materials, despite their extremely slow diffusion dynamics. A key was to use thiourea, which anomalously forms a zigzag <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-bonded array that does not induce unfavorable crystallization. Another key was to incorporate a structural element for activating the exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-bonded pairs, which enables the fractured portions to rejoin readily upon compression.</p>

We present geophysical data documenting a cluster of kilometer-wide craters and mounds from the Barents Sea floor associated with large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e expulsion. Combined with ice sheet/gas hydrate modeling, our results indicate that during glaciation, natural gas migrated from underlying hydrocarbon reservoirs and was sequestered extensively as subglacial gas hydrates. Upon ice sheet retreat, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e from this hydrate reservoir concentrated in massive mounds before being abruptly released to form craters.

Extensive water ice within Ceres’ aqueously altered regolith: Evidence from nuclear spectroscopy

Electrified methane reforming: A compact approach to greener industrial hydrogen production
<p>Electrification of conventionally fired chemical reactors has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and provide flexible and compact heat generation. Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically heated catalytic structure directly into a steam-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e–reforming (SMR) reactor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> production. Intimate contact between the electric heat source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases catalyst utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated design with small characteristic length scales allows compact reactor designs, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer platforms. Electrification of SMR offers a strong platform for new reactor design, scale, and implementation opportunities. Implemented on a global scale, this could correspond to a reduction of nearly 1% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

The nanometer-sized dust experiences collisions with exospheric (upper atmosphere) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> and molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>, which forces it to fall from the ring into the ionosphere and lower atmosphere. We used the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument to detect and characterize this dust transport and also found that diffusion dominates above and near the altitude of peak ionospheric density. This mechanism results in a mass deposition into the equatorial atmosphere of ~5 kilograms per second, constraining the age of the D-ring.</p>

Resonance-stabilized hydrocarbon-radical chain reactions may explain soot inception and growth
<p>Mystery surrounds the transition from gas-phase hydrocarbon precursors to terrestrial soot and interstellar dust, which are carbonaceous particles formed under similar conditions. Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known precursors to high-temperature carbonaceous-particle formation, the molecular pathways that initiate particle formation are unknown. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for rapid molecular clustering–reaction pathways involving radicals with extended conjugation. These radicals react with other hydrocarbon species to form covalently bound complexes that promote further growth and clustering by regenerating resonance-stabilized radicals through low-barrier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-abstraction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-ejection reactions. Such radical–chain reaction pathways may lead to covalently bound clusters of PAHs and other hydrocarbons that would otherwise be too small to condense at high temperatures, thus providing the key mechanistic steps for rapid particle formation and surface growth by hydrocarbon chemisorption.</p>

Insulator-metal transition in dense fluid deuterium
<p>Dense fluid metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> occupies the interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and many extrasolar planets, where pressures reach millions of atmospheres. Planetary structure models must describe accurately the transition from the outer molecular envelopes to the interior metallic regions. We report optical measurements of dynamically compressed fluid deuterium to 600 gigapascals (GPa) that reveal an increasing refractive index, the onset of absorption of visible light near 150 GPa, and a transition to metal-like reflectivity (exceeding 30%) near 200 GPa, all at temperatures below 2000 kelvin. Our measurements and analysis address existing discrepancies between static and dynamic experiments for the insulator-metal transition in dense fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> isotopes.

Assessment of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain
<p>Methane emissions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were estimated by using ground-based, facility-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for ~30% of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally, our facility-based estimate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 ± 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas combustion. Substantial emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Structural basis for methylphosphonate biosynthesis
<p>Methylphosphonate synthase (MPnS) produces methylphosphonate, a metabolic precursor to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e in the upper ocean. Here, we determine a 2.35-angstrom resolution structure of MPnS and discover that it has an unusual 2-histidine-1-glutamine iron-coordinating triad. We further solve the structure of a related enzyme, hydroxyethylphosphonate dioxygenase from <i>Streptomyces albus</i> (<i>Sa</i>HEPD), and find that it displays the same motif. <i>Sa</i>HEPD can be converted into an MPnS by mutation of glutamine-adjacent residues, identifying the molecular requirements for methylphosphonate synthesis. Using these sequence markers, we find numerous putative MPnSs in marine microbiomes and confirm that MPnS is present in the abundant <i>Pelagibacter ubique.</i> The ubiquity of MPnS-containing microbes supports the proposal that methylphosphonate is a source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e in the upper, aerobic ocean, where phosphorus-starved microbes catabolize methylphosphonate for its phosphorus.</p>

The biosynthetic pathway of coenzyme F430 in methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea

Hydrogen Sulfide Increases Production of NADPH Oxidase-Dependent Hydrogen Peroxide and Phospholipase D-Derived Phosphatidic Acid in Guard Cell Signaling<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important gaseous signaling molecule in plants that participates in stress responses and development. <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase 1, one of the enzymatic sources of H<sub>2</sub>S in plants, participates in abscisic acid-induced stomatal closure. We combined pharmacological and genetic approaches to elucidate the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in stomatal closure and the interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and other second messengers of the guard cell signaling network, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and phospholipase D (PLD)-derived phosphatidic acid in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Both NADPH oxidase isoforms, respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH)D and RBOHF, were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal closure. In vivo imaging using the cytosolic ratiometric fluorescent biosensor roGFP2-Orp1 revealed that H<sub>2</sub>S stimulates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in Arabidopsis guard cells. Additionally, we observed an interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and PLD activity in the regulation of reactive oxygen species production and stomatal movement. The PLDα1 and PLDδ isoforms were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal closure, and most of the H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production required the activity of PLDα1. Finally, we showed that H<sub>2</sub>S induced increases in the PLDδ-derived phosphatidic acid levels in guard cells. Our results revealed the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in the signaling network that controls stomatal closure, and suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S regulates NADPH oxidase and PLD activity in guard cells.</p>

Histone Deacetylase Is Required for GA-Induced Programmed Cell Death in Maize Aleurone Layers
<p>Recent discoveries have shown that epigenetic regulation is an integral part of phytohormone-mediated processes. The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) triggers a series of events in cereal aleurone cells that lead to programmed cell death (PCD), but the signaling cascade mediating GA-induced PCD in cereal aleurone layers remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity gradually increased relative to histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, leading to a global decrease in histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels during PCD of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) embryoless aleurone layers after 3 d of treatment with GA. HDAC inhibition prevented GA-induced PCD in embryoless aleurone cells, whereas HAT inhibition resulted in PCD even in the absence of GA. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations increased in GA- or HAT inhibitor-treated aleurone cells due to reduced levels of reactive oxygen species scavengers. Hydrogen peroxide-treated aleurone cells showed no changes in the activity or expression of HATs and HDACs. We show that it is possible to predict whether epigenetic modification enzymes serve as a regulator of the GA-triggered PCD signaling pathway in maize aleurone layers. Taken together, these findings reveal that HDAC activity is required for GA-induced PCD in maize aleurone layers and regulates PCD via the reactive oxygen species-mediated signal transduction pathway.</p>

A Dioxygenase Catalyzes Steroid 16α-Hydroxylation in Steroidal Glycoalkaloid Biosynthesis
<p>Steroidal gly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>kaloids (SGAs) are toxic specialized metabolites that are found in the Solanaceae. Potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) contains the SGAs α-solanine and α-chaconine, while tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) contains α-tomatine, all of which are biosynthesized from cholesterol. However, although two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that catalyze the 22- and 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol have been identified, the 16-hydroxylase remains unknown. Feeding with deuterium-labeled cholesterol indicated that the 16α- and 16β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> atoms of cholesterol were eliminated to form α-solanine and α-chaconine in potato, while only the 16α-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> atom was eliminated in α-tomatine biosynthesis, suggesting that a single oxidation at C-16 takes place during tomato SGA biosynthesis while a two-step oxidation occurs in potato. Here, we show that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, designated as 16DOX, is involved in SGA biosynthesis. We found that the transcript of potato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>St16DOX</i>) was expressed at high levels in the tuber sprouts, where large amounts of SGAs are accumulated. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant St16DOX protein revealed that St16DOX catalyzes the 16α-hydroxylation of hydroxycholesterols and that (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol was the best substrate among the nine compounds tested. <i>St16DOX</i>-silenced potato plants contained significantly lower levels of SGAs, and a detailed metabolite analysis revealed that they accumulated the glycosides of (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol. Analysis of the tomato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>Sl16DOX</i>) gene gave essentially the same results. These findings clearly indicate that 16DOX is a steroid 16α-hydroxylase that functions in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, <i>St16DOX</i> silencing did not affect potato tuber yield, indicating that <i>16DOX</i> may be a suitable target for controlling toxic SGA levels in potato.</p>

Aldehyde Oxidase 4 Plays a Critical Role in Delaying Silique Senescence by Catalyzing Aldehyde Detoxification
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) aldehyde oxidases are a multigene family of four oxidases (AAO1–AAO4) that oxidize a variety of aldehydes, among them abscisic aldehyde, which is oxidized to the phytohormone abscisic acid. Toxic aldehydes are generated in plants both under normal conditions and in response to stress. The detoxification of such aldehydes by oxidation is attributed to aldehyde de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>ases but never to aldehyde oxidases. The feasibility of the detoxification of aldehydes in siliques via oxidation by AAO4 was demonstrated, first, by its ability to efficiently oxidize an array of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, including the reactive carbonyl species (RCS) acrolein, hydroxyl-2-nonenal, and malondialdehyde. Next, exogenous application of several aldehydes to siliques in AAO4 knockout (KO) Arabidopsis plants induced severe tissue damage and enhanced malondialdehyde levels and senescence symptoms, but not in wild-type siliques. Furthermore, abiotic stresses such as dark and ultraviolet C irradiation caused an increase in endogenous RCS and higher expression levels of senescence marker genes, leading to premature senescence of KO siliques, whereas RCS and senescence marker levels in wild-type siliques were hardly affected. Finally, in naturally senesced KO siliques, higher endogenous RCS levels were associated with enhanced senescence molecular markers, chlorophyll degradation, and earlier seed shattering compared with the wild type. The aldehyde-dependent differential generation of superoxide and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> peroxide by AAO4 and the induction of AAO4 expression by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> peroxide shown here suggest a self-amplification mechanism for detoxifying additional reactive aldehydes produced during stress. Taken together, our results indicate that AAO4 plays a critical role in delaying senescence in siliques by catalyzing aldehyde detoxification.</p>

Evolutionary and Functional Analysis of Membrane-Bound NAC Transcription Factor Genes in Soybean
<p>Functional divergence is thought to be an important evolutionary driving force for the retention of duplicate genes. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) membrane-bound NAC transcription factor (NTL) genes. NTLs are thought to be components of stress signaling and unique in their requirement for proteolytic cleavage to free them from the membrane. Most of the 15 <i>GmNTL</i> genes appear to have evolved under strong purifying selection. By analyzing the phylogenetic tree and gene synteny, we identified seven duplicate gene pairs generated by the latest whole-genome duplication. The members of each pair were shown to have variously diverged at the transcriptional (organ specificity and responsiveness to stress), posttranscriptional (alternative splicing), and protein (proteolysis-mediated membrane release and transactivation activity) levels. The dormant (full-length protein) and active (protein without a transmembrane motif) forms of one pair of duplicated gene products (GmNTL1/GmNLT11) were each separately constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The heteroexpression of active but not dormant forms of these proteins caused improved tolerance to abiotic stresses, suggesting that membrane release was required for their functionality. Arabidopsis carrying the dormant form of GmNTL1 was more tolerant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> peroxide, which induces its membrane release. Tolerance was not increased in the line carrying dormant GmNTL11, which was not released by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> peroxide treatment. Thus, NTL-release pattern changes may cause phenotypic divergence. It was concluded that a variety of functional divergences contributed to the retention of these <i>GmNTL</i> duplicates.</p>

Arylation of hydrocarbons enabled by organosilicon reagents and weakly coordinating anions

Their high-energy, promiscuous reactivity profiles have hampered applications in selective intermolecular processes. We report a reaction design that overcomes these challenges. Specifically, we found that β-silicon–stabilized aryl cation equivalents, generated via silylium-mediated fluoride activation, undergo insertion into sp<sup>3</sup> and sp<sup>2</sup> C–H bonds.

We present a general carbon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bond activation process that combines readily available aliphatic amines and the feedstock gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon monoxid</span></strong>e to form synthetically versatile value-added amide products. The operationally straightforward palladium-catalyzed process exploits a distinct reaction pathway, wherein a sterically hindered carboxylate ligand orchestrates an amine attack on a palladium anhydride to transform aliphatic amines into β-lactams. The reaction is successful with a wide range of secondary amines and can be used as a late-stage functionalization tactic to deliver advanced, highly functionalized amine products of utility for pharmaceutical research and other areas.</p>

The methanogenic CO<sub>2</sub> reducing-and-fixing enzyme is bifunctional and contains 46 [4Fe-4S] clusters
<p>Biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e formation starts with a challenging adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon dioxid</span></strong>e (CO<sub>2</sub>) fixation process. We explored this enzymatic process by solving the x-ray crystal structure of formyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ofuran de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>ase, determined here as Fwd(ABCDFG)<sub>2</sub> and Fwd(ABCDFG)<sub>4</sub> complexes, from <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>othermobacter wolfeii</i>. The latter 800-kilodalton apparatus consists of four peripheral catalytic sections and an electron-supplying core with 46 electronically coupled [4Fe-4S] clusters. Catalysis is separately performed by subunits FwdBD (FwdB and FwdD), which are related to tungsten-containing formate de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>ase, and subunit FwdA, a binuclear metal center carrying amidohydrolase. CO<sub>2</sub> is first reduced to formate in FwdBD, which then diffuses through a 43-angstrom-long tunnel to FwdA, where it condenses with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ofuran to formyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ofuran. The arrangement of [4Fe-4S] clusters functions as an electron relay but potentially also couples the four tungstopterin active sites over 206 angstroms.</p>

Real-space imaging of molecular structure and chemical bonding by single-molecule inelastic tunneling probe
<p>The arrangement of atoms and bonds in a molecule influences its physical and chemical properties. The scanning tunneling microscope can provide electronic and vibrational signatures of single molecules. However, these signatures do not relate simply to the molecular structure and bonding. We constructed an inelastic tunneling probe based on the scanning tunneling microscope to sense the local potential energy landscape of an adsorbed molecule with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon monoxid</span></strong>e (CO)–terminated tip. The skeletal structure and bonding of the molecule are revealed from imaging the spatial variations of a CO vibration as the CO-terminated tip probes the core of the interactions between adjacent atoms. An application of the inelastic tunneling probe reveals the sharing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> atoms among multiple centers in intramolecular and extramolecular bonding.</p>

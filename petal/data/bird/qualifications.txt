Prognostic Value of Noninvasive Cardiovascular Testing in Patients With Stable Chest Pain
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Optimal management of patients with stable chest pain relies on the prognostic information provided by noninvasive cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing, but there are limited data from randomized trials comparing anatomic with functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain and intermediate pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> probability for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomly assigned to functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). Site-based diagnostic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> reports were classified as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal. The primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalizations over a median follow-up of 26.1 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both the prevalence of normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results and incidence rate of events in these patients were significantly lower among 4500 patients randomly assigned to CTA in comparison with 4602 patients randomly assigned to functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (33.4% versus 78.0%, and 0.9% versus 2.1%, respectively; both <i>P</i><0.001). In CTA, 54.0% of events (n=74/137) occurred in patients with nonobstructive CAD (1%–69% stenosis). Prevalence of obstructive CAD and myocardial ischemia was low (11.9% versus 12.7%, respectively), with both findings having similar prognostic value (hazard ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.60–5.39; and 3.47; 95% CI, 2.42–4.99). When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> findings were stratified as mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal, hazard ratios for events in comparison with normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s increased proportionally for CTA (2.94, 7.67, 10.13; all <i>P</i><0.001) but not for corresponding functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing categories (0.94 [<i>P</i>=0.87], 2.65 [<i>P</i>=0.001], 3.88 [<i>P</i><0.001]). The discriminatory ability of CTA in predicting events was significantly better than functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (c-index, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68–0.76 versus 0.64; 95% CI, 0.59–0.69; <i>P</i>=0.04). If 2714 patients with at least an intermediate Framingham Risk Score (>10%) who had a normal functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> were reclassified as being mildly abnormal, the discriminatory capacity improved to 0.69 (95% CI, 0.64–0.74).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Coronary CTA, by identifying patients at risk because of nonobstructive CAD, provides better prognostic information than functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing in contemporary patients who have stable chest pain with a low burden of obstructive CAD, myocardial ischemia, and events.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Educated natural killer cells show dynamic movement of the activating receptor NKp46 and confinement of the inhibitory receptor Ly49A
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ated natural killer (NK) cells have inhibitory receptors specific for self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and kill cancer cells more efficiently than do NK cells that do not have such receptors (hyporesponsive NK cells). The mechanism behind this functional empowerment through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ation has so far not been fully described. In addition, distinctive phenotypic markers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ated NK cells at the single-cell level are lacking. We developed a refined version of the image mean square displacement (iMSD) method (called iMSD carpet analysis) and used it in combination with single-particle tracking to characterize the dynamics of the activating receptor NKp46 and the inhibitory receptor Ly49A on resting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ated versus hyporesponsive murine NK cells. Most of the NKp46 and Ly49A molecules were restricted to microdomains; however, individual NKp46 molecules resided in these domains for shorter periods and diffused faster on the surface of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ated, compared to hyporesponsive, NK cells. In contrast, the movement of Ly49A was more constrained in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ated NK cells compared to hyporesponsive NK cells. Either disrupting the actin cytoskeleton or adding cholesterol to the cells prohibited activating signaling, suggesting that the dynamics of receptor movements within the cell membrane are critical for the proper activation of NK cells. The faster and more dynamic movement of NKp46 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ated NK cells may facilitate a swifter response to interactions with target cells.</p>

Strong Epistatic Interactions within a Single Protein
<p>A central question in protein molecular evolution is whether an amino acid that occurs at a given site makes an independent contribution to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness or whether its contribution depends on other amino acid sites in the protein sequence, a phenomenon known as intragenic epistasis. In the absence of intragenic epistasis, natural selection acts on a protein mutation independent of its genetic background, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>mentally determined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness for a mutation should be the same across all genetic backgrounds. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed this hypothesis by using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a well-characterized deleterious single amino acid substitution in 56 different hepatitis C virus NS3 protease variants. The catalytic efficiency of the mutated proteases was determined and compared with the corresponding wild-type protein. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness effects ranged from lethality to significantly beneficial. Although primarily deleterious and lethal effects were observed (41 and 5 out of 56 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed variants, respectively), deleterious effects ranged from near neutral (−26.7% r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>tion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness) to near lethal (−98.5%). Our findings demonstrate that the introduced amino acid substitution has different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness effects in different protein variants and provide independent support for the relevant role of intragenic epistasis in protein evolution.</p>

Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (<i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>)
<p>Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical abilities are widespread among vertebrates. While <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in <i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia desert. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not controlled for non-numerical continuous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli controlled for continuous quantities and half not controlled for continuous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed in similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli controlled for continuous quantities proved able to learn the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed with visual stimuli.</p>

Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> kit for the diagnosis of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion criteria were all clinical studies where the diagnosis   of PJI was uncertain. All studies selected used the Musculoskeletal   Infection Society (MSIS) or modified MSIS criteria. Two independent   reviewers reviewed the studies and extracted data. A meta-analysis   of results was carried out: pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive   and negative likelihood ratio, heterogeneity and areas under curves   are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ten studies (759 patients) were included. Of these, seven studies   (640 patients) evaluated the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay   and three (119 patients) the lateral flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>. The pooled sensitivity   and specificity of the qualitative α-defensin laboratory immunoassay   was 0.953 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.984) and 0.965 (95%   CI 0.943 to 0.979) respectively.

Public Health England reports that patients   with TB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence delays in diagnosis and treatment. Our aims were   to determine the demographics, presentation and investigation of   patients with a TB infection of bones and joints, to help doctors   assessing potential cases and to identify avoidable delays.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective observational study of all adults with   positive TB cultures on specimens taken at a tertiary orthopaedic   centre between June 2012 and May 2014. A laboratory information   system search identified the patients. The demographics, clinical presentation,   radiology, histopathology and key clinical dates were obtained from   medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 31 adult patients were identified. Their median age   was 37 years (interquartile range (IQR): 29 to 53); 21 (68%) were   male; 89% were migrants. The main sites affected were joints (10,   32%), the spine (8, 26%) and long bones (6, 19%); 8 (26%) had multifocal   disease. The most common presenting symptoms were pain (29/31, 94%)   and swelling (26/28, 93%). ‘Typical’ symptoms of TB, such as fever,   sweats and weight loss, were uncommon. Patients waited a median   of seven months (IQR 3 to 13.5) between the onset of symptoms and referral   to the tertiary centre and 2.3 months (IQR 1.6 to 3.4.)) between   referral and starting treatment. Radiology suggested TB in 26 (84%),   but in seven patients (23%) the initial biopsy specimens were not   sent for mycobacterial culture, necessitating a second biopsy.

Multimodality Strategy for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment among adults without known CVD are limited by suboptimal performance and a narrow focus on only atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). We hypothesized that a strategy combining promising biomarkers across multiple different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing modalities would improve global and atherosclerotic CVD risk assessment among individuals without known CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) (n=6621) and the Dallas Heart Study (n=2202) who were free from CVD and underwent measurement of left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Associations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results with the global composite CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary or peripheral revascularization, incident heart failure, or atrial fibrillation) and ASCVD (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) were assessed over >10 years of follow-up.

When the 5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s were added to the base model, the c-statistic improved from 0.74 to 0.79 (<i>P</i>=0.001), significant integrated discrimination improvement (0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.08, <i>P</i><0.001) and category free net reclassification improvement (0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–0.56; <i>P</i>=0.003) were observed, and the model was well calibrated (χ<sup>2</sup>=12.2, <i>P</i>=0.20).

Impact of Combat Deployment and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder on Newly Reported Coronary Heart Disease Among US Active Duty and Reserve Forces
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have exposed thousands of service members to intense stress, and as a result, many have developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The role of military deployment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ences and PTSD in coronary heart disease (CHD) is not well defined, especially in young US service members with recent combat exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate the relationships between wartime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ences, PTSD, and CHD. Current and former US military <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">personnel</span></strong> from all service branches participating in the Millennium Cohort Study during 2001 to 2008 (n=60 025) were evaluated for newly self-reported CHD.

The rise, collapse, and compaction of Mt. Mantap from the 3 September 2017 North Korean nuclear test
<p>Surveillance of clandestine nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s relies on a global seismic network, but the potential of spaceborne monitoring has been underexploited. We used satellite radar imagery to determine the complete surface displacement field of up to 3.5 meters of divergent horizontal motion with 0.5 meters of subsidence associated with North Korea’s largest underground nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>. Combining insight from geodetic and seismological remote sensing, we found that the aftermath of the initial explosive deformation involved subsidence associated with subsurface collapse and aseismic compaction of the damaged rocks of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> site. The explosive yield from the nuclear detonation with best-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ting source parameters for 450-meter depth was 191 kilotonnes of TNT equivalent.

Digital chemical test impresses
<p>Toxicologists this week unveiled a chemical safety screening tool that could greatly r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>e the need for six common animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s. Those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s account for nearly 60% of the estimated 3 million to 4 million animals used annually in risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing worldwide. The computerized tool—built on a massive database of molecular structures and existing safety data—appears to match, and sometimes improve on, the results of animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s for properties such as skin sensitization and eye irritation, the researchers report in today's issue of <i>Toxicological Sciences</i>. But it also has limitations; for instance, the method can't reliably evaluate a chemical's risk of causing cancer. And it's not clear how open regulatory agencies will be to adopting a nonanimal approach, although both European and U.S. regulators say they are open to the idea. Still, the big data approach is encouraging to those seeking to r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>e and replace animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing.</p>

Fitness Trade-Offs Lead to Suppressor Tolerance in Yeast
<p>Genetic variation among individuals within a population provides the raw material for phenotypic diversity upon which natural selection operates. Some given variants can act on multiple standing genomic variations simultaneously and release previously inaccessible phenotypes, leading to increased adaptive potential upon challenging environments. Previously, we identified such a variant related to a tRNA nonsense suppressor in yeast. When introduced into other genetic backgrounds, the suppressor led to an increased population phenotypic variance on various culture conditions, conferring background and environment specific selective advantages. Nonetheless, most isolates are intolerant to the suppressor on rich media due to a severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness cost. Here, we found that the tolerance to suppressor is related to a surprising level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness outburst, showing a trade-off effect to accommodate the cost of carrying the suppressor. To dissect the genetic basis of such trade-offs, we crossed strains with contrasting tolerance levels on rich media, and analyzed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness distribution patterns in the offspring. Combining quantitative tetrad analysis and bulk segregant analysis, we identified two genes, namely <i>MKT1</i> and <i>RGA1</i>, involved in suppressor tolerance. We showed that alleles from the tolerant parent for both genes conferred a significant gain of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness, which increased the suppressor tolerance. Our results present a detailed dissection of suppressor tolerance in yeast and provide insights into the molecular basis of trade-offs between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness and evolutionary potential.</p>

Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies
<p>Life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking males that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence and physical environment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> males are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local environment. Although dominant males are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence. We hypothesized that as males mature they might hone their fighting tactics based on observation of other males fighting. We compared males of different ages and sizes in distinctly different physical environments and subsequently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed their fighting skills. We found that a size difference previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing environmental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that males only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence than the physical complexity of the territory.</p>

Ventricular Fibrillation Conversion Testing After Implantation of a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), subcutaneous (S)-ICDs require a higher energy for effective defibrillation. Although ventricular fibrillation conversion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (CT) is recommended after S-ICD implantation to ensure an adequate margin between the defibrillation threshold and maximum device output (80J), prior work found that adherence to this recommendation is declining.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied first-time recipients of S-ICDs (between September 28, 2012, and April 1, 2016) in the National Cardiovascular Database Registry ICD Registry to determine predictors of use of CT, predictors of an insufficient safety margin (ISM, defined as ventricular fibrillation conversion energy >65J) during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing, and inhospital outcomes associated with use of CT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict use of CT and ISM. Inverse probability weighted logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between use of CT and inhospital adverse events including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing was performed in 70.7% (n=5624) of 7960 patients with S-ICDs. Although deferral of CT was associated with several patient characteristics (including increased body mass index, increased body surface area, severely r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ed ejection fraction, dialysis dependence, warfarin use, anemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), the facility effect was comparatively more important (area under the curve for patient level versus generalized linear mixed model: 0.619 versus 0.877). An ISM occurred in 6.9% (n=336) of 4864 patients without a prior ICD and was more common among white patients and those with ventricular pacing on the preimplant ECG, higher preimplant blood pressure, larger body surface area, higher body mass index, and lower ejection fraction. A risk score was able to identify patients at low (<5%), medium (5% to 10%), and high risk (>10%) for ISM. CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing after S-ICD implantation was driven by facility preference to a greater extent than patient factors and was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications or death.

Prognostic Value of Coronary Artery Calcium in the PROMISE Study (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an established predictor of future major adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals. However, limited data exist as to how CAC compares with functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (FT) in estimating prognosis in symptomatic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain (or dyspnea) and intermediate pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> probability for obstructive coronary artery disease were randomized to FT (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or anatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing. We evaluated those who underwent CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing as part of the anatomic evaluation (n=4209) and compared that with results of FT (n=4602). We stratified CAC and FT results as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal (for CAC: 0, 1–99 Agatston score [AS], 100–400 AS, and >400 AS, respectively; for FT: normal, mild=late positive treadmill, moderate=early positive treadmill or single-vessel ischemia, and severe=large ischemic region abnormality). The primary end point was all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization over a median follow-up of 26.1 months. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and C statistics to determine predictive and discriminatory values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, the distribution of normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results was significantly different between FT and CAC (FT: normal, n=3588 [78.0%]; mild, n=432 [9.4%]; moderate, n=217 [4.7%]; severe, n=365 [7.9%]; CAC: normal, n=1457 [34.6%]; mild, n=1340 [31.8%]; moderate, n=772 [18.3%]; severe, n=640 [15.2%]; <i>P</i><0.0001). Moderate and severe abnormalities in both arms robustly predicted events (moderate: CAC: HR, 3.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.81–5.44; and FT: HR, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–4.83; severe: CAC: HR, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.99–6.36; and FT: HR, 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 2.58–5.85). In the CAC arm, the majority of events (n=112 of 133, 84%) occurred in patients with any positive CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> (score >0), whereas fewer than half of events occurred in patients with mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal FT (n=57 of 132, 43%; <i>P</i><0.001). In contrast, any abnormality on FT was significantly more specific for predicting events (78.6% for FT versus 35.2% for CAC; <i>P</i><0.001). Overall discriminatory ability in predicting the primary end point of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina hospitalization was similar and fair for both CAC and FT (C statistic, 0.67 versus 0.64).

The role of education interventions in improving economic rationality
<p>Schooling rewards people with labor market returns and nonpecuniary bene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>s in other realms of life. However, there is no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>mental evidence showing that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ation interventions improve individual economic rationality. We examine this hypothesis by studying a randomized 1-year financial support program for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ation in Malawi that r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ed absence and dropout rates and increased scores on a qualification exam of female secondary school students. We measure economic rationality 4 years after the intervention by using lab-in-the-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments to create scores of consistency with utility maximization that are derived from revealed preference theory. We find that students assigned to the intervention had higher scores of rationality. The results remain robust after controlling for changes in cognitive and noncognitive skills. Our results suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ation enhances the quality of economic decision-making.</p>

Detection and localization of surgically resectable cancers with a multi-analyte blood test
<p>Earlier detection is key to r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ing cancer deaths.

We applied this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>, called CancerSEEK, to 1005 patients with nonmetastatic, clinically detected cancers of the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, lung, or breast. CancerSEEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s were positive in a median of 70% of the eight cancer types. The sensitivities ranged from 69 to 98% for the detection of five cancer types (ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, and esophagus) for which there are no screening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s available for average-risk individuals. The specificity of CancerSEEK was greater than 99%: only 7 of 812 healthy controls scored positive. In addition, CancerSEEK localized the cancer to a small number of anatomic sites in a median of 83% of the patients.</p>

How “you” makes meaning
<p>“You” is one of the most common words in the English language. Although it typically refers to the person addressed (“How are you?”), “you” is also used to make timeless statements about people in general (“You win some, you lose some.”). Here, we demonstrate that this ubiquitous but understudied linguistic device, known as “generic-you,” has important implications for how people derive meaning from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence. Across six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments, we found that generic-you is used to express norms in both ordinary and emotional contexts and that producing generic-you when reflecting on negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ences allows people to “normalize” their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence by extending it beyond the self. In this way, a simple linguistic device serves a powerful meaning-making function.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As water often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant water capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of water across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> hypotheses related to root water transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>mental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of water pathways and root radial hydraulic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream hydraulic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments, while the contribution of water-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of water flow across roots. The explicit root hydraulic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments from the literature and suggests <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root water relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root hydraulics.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
High Fitness Costs and Instability of Gene Duplications Reduce Rates of Evolution of New Genes by Duplication-Divergence Mechanisms
<p>An important mechanism for generation of new genes is by duplication-divergence of existing genes. Duplication-divergence includes several different submodels, such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of neutral mutations the original function is distributed between two partially functional and complementary genes, and neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness cost and genetic stability of the duplications. Here, we determined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness cost and stability of defined gene duplications/amplifications on a low copy number plasmid. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>mental results show that the costs of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each additional kilo base pairs of DNA r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>es <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene amplifications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness costs and instability strongly r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>es the likelihood of both sub- and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial functions.</p>

Disturbed Flow Promotes Arterial Stiffening Through Thrombospondin-1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Arterial stiffness and wall shear stress are powerful determinants of cardiovascular health, and arterial stiffness is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Low and oscillatory wall shear stress, termed disturbed flow (d-flow), promotes atherosclerotic arterial remodeling, but the relationship between d-flow and arterial stiffness is not well understood. The objective of this study was to define the role of d-flow on arterial stiffening and discover the relevant signaling pathways by which d-flow stiffens arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>D-flow was induced in the carotid arteries of young and old mice of both sexes. Arterial stiffness was quantified ex vivo with cylindrical biaxial mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing and in vivo from duplex ultrasound and compared with unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Gene expression and pathway analysis was performed on endothelial cell–enriched RNA and validated by immunohistochemistry. In vitro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing of signaling pathways was performed under oscillatory and laminar wall shear stress conditions. Human arteries from regions of d-flow and stable flow were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed ex vivo to validate critical results from the animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>D-flow induced arterial stiffening through collagen deposition after partial carotid ligation, and the degree of stiffening was similar to that of unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Intimal gene pathway analyses identified transforming growth factor-β pathways as having a prominent role in this stiffened arterial response, but this was attributable to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) stimulation of profibrotic genes and not changes to transforming growth factor-β. In vitro and in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing under d-flow conditions identified a possible role for TSP-1 activation of transforming growth factor-β in the upregulation of these genes. TSP-1 knockout animals had significantly less arterial stiffening in response to d-flow than wild-type carotid arteries. Human arteries exposed to d-flow had similar increases TSP-1 and collagen gene expression as seen in our model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TSP-1 has a critical role in shear-mediated arterial stiffening that is mediated in part through TSP-1’s activation of the profibrotic signaling pathways of transforming growth factor-β. Molecular targets in this pathway may lead to novel therapies to limit arterial stiffening and the progression of disease in arteries exposed to d-flow.</p></sec>

Geometric Morphometric Character Suites as Phylogenetic Data: Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Gastropod Shells
<p>Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many of the best represented constituents of the fossil record—including diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks—have mineralized skeletons with limited discrete characteristics, making morphological phylogenies difficult to construct. In contrast to their paucity of phylogenetic characters, the mineralized structures (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive shapes that have long proved useful for their classification. The recent introduction of methodologies for including continuous data directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available characters, making it possible to produce phylogenies based, in whole or part, on continuous character data collected from such taxa. Geometric morphometric methods provide tools for accurately characterizing shape variation and can produce quantitative data that can therefore now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a nonarbitrary manner. Here, the marine gastropod genus <i>Conus</i> is used to evaluate the ability of continuous characters—generated from a geometric morphometric analysis of shell shape—to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic hypothesis constructed using molecular and morphological data. Furthermore, the ability of continuous characters derived from geometric morphometric analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete characters into a phylogeny with their extant relatives was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed by simulating the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular partition of individual extant species to produce a “cladistic pseudofossil” with only the geometric morphometric derived characters coded. The phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then compared with its placement in the total evidence tree and a symmetric resampling tree to evaluate the degree to which morphometric characters alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33–45% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> cases (depending upon the approach used for measuring success), it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric characters. This suggests that the incorporation of extinct <i>Conus</i> taxa into phylogenetic hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also has potential to contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions for other major components of the fossil record that lack numerous discrete characters.

The MOOC pivot
<p>When massive open online courses (MOOCs) first captured global attention in 2012, advocates imagined a disruptive transformation in postsecondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ation. Video lectures from the world's best professors could be broadcast to the farthest reaches of the networked world, and students could demonstrate proficiency using innovative computer-graded assessments, even in places with limited access to traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ation. But after promising a reordering of higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ation, we see the field instead coalescing around a different, much older business model: helping universities outsource their online master's degrees for professionals (<i>1</i>). To better understand the reasons for this shift, we highlight three patterns emerging from data on MOOCs provided by Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) via the edX platform: The vast majority of MOOC learners never return after their first year, the growth in MOOC participation has been concentrated almost entirely in the world's most affluent countries, and the bane of MOOCs—low completion rates (<i>2</i>)—has not improved over 6 years.</p>

The controversial correlates of consciousness
<p>The mechanism of consciousness is one of the most fundamental, exciting, and challenging pursuits in 21st-century science. Although the field of consciousness studies attracts a diverse array of thinkers who posit myriad physical or metaphysical substrates for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence, consciousness must have a neural basis. But where in the brain is conscious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence generated? It would seem that, given this remarkable era of technical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>mental prowess in the neurosciences, we would be homing in on the specific circuits or precise neuronal subpopulations that generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence. To the contrary, there is still active debate as to whether the neural correlates of consciousness are, in coarse terms, located in the back or the front of the brain (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). On page 537 of this issue, van Vugt <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) provide evidence that the prefrontal cortex is one of the brain regions that mediates visual consciousness. Additionally, Joglekar <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) provide evidence that the prefrontal cortex is important for igniting neural networks that contribute to visual signal processing. Both studies support a model for consciousness that involves distributed and reciprocal interactions across the cortex.</p>

Mounting evidence from animal and human studies suggests that brain development and behavior are influenced by early life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ences. Several compelling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>mental models have been developed to study the effect of early life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ences on the brain, such as stress, exposure to toxins, availability of nutrients, adversity, and quality of maternal care (<i>1</i>). The relationship between genes and environment on the brain and how they affect behavior has been a long-standing issue. Can the genome of individual brain cells be changed by environmental factors? If so, which types of genetic changes can result? What is the molecular basis of this genetic diversity? What are the physiological implications? On page 1395 of this issue, Bedrosian <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) explore one possibility for how neuronal genomes can exhibit plasticity in response to environmental factors during early life, providing integrative evidence for the effect of early maternal care on the genomes of neurons.</p>

Mutation dynamics and fitness effects followed in single cells
<p>Mutations have been investigated for more than a century but remain difficult to observe directly in single cells, which limits the characterization of their dynamics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness effects. By combining microfluidics, time-lapse imaging, and a fluorescent tag of the mismatch repair system in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we visualized the emergence of mutations in single cells, revealing Poissonian dynamics. Concomitantly, we tracked the growth and life span of single cells, accumulating ~20,000 mutations genome-wide over hundreds of generations. This analysis revealed that 1% of mutations were lethal; nonlethal mutations displayed a heavy-tailed distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness effects and were dominated by quasi-neutral mutations with an average cost of 0.3%. Our approach has enabled the investigation of single-cell individuality in mutation rate, mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness costs, and mutation interactions.</p>

The nature of nurture: Effects of parental genotypes
<p>Sequence variants in the parental genomes that are not transmitted to a child (the proband) are often ignored in genetic studies. Here we show that nontransmitted alleles can affect a child through their impacts on the parents and other relatives, a phenomenon we call “genetic nurture.” Using results from a meta-analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ational attainment, we find that the polygenic score computed for the nontransmitted alleles of 21,637 probands with at least one parent genotyped has an estimated effect on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ational attainment of the proband that is 29.9% (<i>P</i> = 1.6 × 10<sup>−14</sup>) of that of the transmitted polygenic score. Genetic nurturing effects of this polygenic score extend to other traits. Paternal and maternal polygenic scores have similar effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ational attainment, but mothers contribute more than fathers to nutrition- and heath-related traits.</p>

Revolutionary malaria tests have unexpected downsides
<p>A cheap, simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> has transformed the treatment of malaria, a major childhood killer in poor countries. With a single drop of blood taken from a finger prick, rapid diagnostic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s (RDTs) can diagnose malaria accurately and almost instantly, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> is so easy to use that volunteers from local communities in remote villages across Africa and Asia now commonly deploy it. Until RDTs became widespread, almost all fevers were treated as if they were malaria, leading to the overuse of the new generation of "wonder drugs," artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which were in danger of being lost to drug resistance. Now, with accurate diagnosis, ACTs can be targeted to those who need them, and the hope has been that patients who don’t have malaria would be treated for the true cause of their fever. But now a huge new study suggests that, along its enormous bene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>s, the rollout of RDTs has had some unintended—and undesirable—consequences: overprescription of antibiotics, which can exacerbate the rapid rise in antibiotic-resistant infections. What’s more, some patients who did not have malaria were given ACTs anyway, and more troubling, some with malaria were not, leaving them at risk of severe disease or death.</p>

Chronic exposure to neonicotinoids reduces honey bee health near corn crops
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments linking neonicotinoids and declining bee health have been criticized for not simulating realistic exposure. Here we quantified the duration and magnitude of neonicotinoid exposure in Canada’s corn-growing regions and used these data to design realistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments to investigate the effect of such insecticides on honey bees. Colonies near corn were naturally exposed to neonicotinoids for up to 4 months—the majority of the honey bee’s active season. Realistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments showed that neonicotinoids increased worker mortality and were associated with declines in social immunity and increased queenlessness over time. We also discovered that the acute toxicity of neonicotinoids to honey bees doubles in the presence of a commonly encountered fungicide.

Negative selection in humans and fruit flies involves synergistic epistasis
<p>Negative selection against deleterious alleles produced by mutation influences within-population variation as the most pervasive form of natural selection. However, it is not known whether deleterious alleles affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness independently, so that cumulative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness loss depends exponentially on the number of deleterious alleles, or synergistically, so that each additional deleterious allele results in a larger decrease in relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness. Negative selection with synergistic epistasis should produce negative linkage disequilibrium between deleterious alleles and, therefore, an underdispersed distribution of the number of deleterious alleles in the genome. Indeed, we detected underdispersion of the number of rare loss-of-function alleles in eight independent data sets from human and fly populations. Thus, selection against rare protein-disrupting alleles is characterized by synergistic epistasis, which may explain how human and fly populations persist despite high genomic mutation rates.</p>

The whole-soil carbon flux in response to warming

Using DNA, radiation therapy gets personal

Growth at Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Requires Acclimation of the Respiratory Chain to Support Photosynthesis
<p>Plants will <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence an elevated atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (ECO<sub>2</sub>) in the future. Growth of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) at ECO<sub>2</sub> more than doubled the leaf protein amount of alternative oxidase (AOX), a non-energy-conserving component of mitochondrial respiration. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> the functional significance of this AOX increase, wild-type tobacco was compared with AOX knockdown and overexpression lines, following growth at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or ECO<sub>2</sub>. The ECO<sub>2</sub>-grown AOX knockdowns had a r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ed capacity for triose phosphate use (TPU) during photosynthesis compared with the other plant lines. This TPU limitation of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation was associated with an increased accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate, sucrose, and starch in the leaves of the knockdowns. Under TPU-limiting conditions, the size of the proton gradient and proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane was enhanced in the knockdowns relative to the other plant lines, suggesting a restriction of chloroplast ATP synthase activity. This restriction was not due to a decline in ATP synthase (AtpB) protein amount. The knockdowns also displayed a photosystem stoichiometry adjustment at ECO<sub>2</sub>, which was absent in the other plant lines. Additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments showed that the way in which AOX supports photosynthesis at ECO<sub>2</sub> is distinct from its previously described role in supporting photosynthesis during water deficit. The results are discussed in terms of how AOX contributes to TPU capacity and the maintenance of chloroplast ATP synthase activity at ECO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the evidence suggests that AOX respiration is needed to maintain both the carbon and energy balance in photosynthetic tissues during growth at ECO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness effects of spontaneous mutations is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease genetics, and conservation biology. To estimate mutation rates and evaluate the effect of selection on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the rate derived from the MA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–selection models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

Activation of the cnidarian oxidative stress response by ultraviolet radiation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and crude oil
<p>Organisms are continuously exposed to reactive chemicals capable of causing oxidative stress and cellular damage. Antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutases (SODs) and catalases, are present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and provide an important means of neutralizing such oxidants. Studies in cnidarians have previously documented the occurrence of antioxidant enzymes (transcript expression, protein expression and/or enzymatic activity), but most of these studies have not been conducted in species with sequenced genomes or included phylogenetic analyses, making it difficult to compare results across species due to uncertainties in the relationships between genes. Through searches of the genome of the sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> Stephenson, one catalase gene and six SOD family members were identified, including three copper/zinc-containing SODs (CuZnSODs), two manganese-containing SODs (MnSODs) and one copper chaperone of SOD (CCS). In 24 h acute toxicity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s, juvenile <i>N. vectensis</i> showed enhanced sensitivity to combinations of ultraviolet radiation (UV) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, specifically pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene and fluoranthene) relative to either stressor alone. Adult <i>N. vectensis</i> exhibited little or no mortality following UV, benzo[a]pyrene or crude oil exposure but exhibited changes in gene expression. Antioxidant enzyme transcripts were both upregulated and downregulated following UV and/or chemical exposure. Expression patterns were most strongly affected by UV exposure but varied between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments, suggesting that responses vary according to the intensity and duration of exposure. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ments provide a basis for comparison with other cnidarian taxa and for further studies of the oxidative stress response in <i>N. vectensis.</i></p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic bene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>s of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Assessing treatment outcomes using a single question
<p>Satisfaction with care is important to both patients   and to those who pay for it. The Net Promoter Score (NPS), widely   used in the service industries, has been introduced into the NHS   as the ‘friends and family <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>’; an overarching measure of patient   satisfaction. It assesses the likelihood of the patient recommending   the healthcare received to another, and is seen as a discriminator   of healthcare performance. We prospectively assessed 6186 individuals   undergoing primary lower limb joint replacement at a single university   hospital to determine the Net Promoter Score for joint replacements   and to evaluate which factors contributed to the response. </p><p>Achieving pain relief (odds ratio (OR) 2.13, confidence interval   (CI) 1.83 to 2.49), the meeting of pre-operative expectation (OR   2.57, CI 2.24 to 2.97), and the hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence (OR 2.33, CI   2.03 to 2.68) are the domains that explain whether a patient would   recommend joint replacement services. These three factors, combined   with the type of surgery undertaken (OR 2.31, CI 1.68 to 3.17),   drove a predictive model that was able to explain 95% of the variation   in the patient’s recommendation response. Though intuitively similar,   this ‘recommendation’ metric was found to be materially different   to satisfaction responses. The difference between THR (NPS 71) and   TKR (NPS 49) suggests that no overarching score for a department   should be used without an adjustment for case mix. However, the   Net Promoter Score does measure a further important dimension to   our existing metrics: the patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">experi</span></strong>ence of healthcare delivery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:622–8.</p>

Derivation and Validation of the CREST Model for Very Early Prediction of Circulatory Etiology Death in Patients Without ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction After Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No practical tool quantitates the risk of circulatory-etiology death (CED) immediately after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. We developed and validated a prediction model to rapidly determine that risk and facilitate triage to individualized treatment pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>With the use of INTCAR (International Cardiac Arrest Registry), an 87-question data set representing 44 centers in the United States and Europe, patients were classified as having had CED or a combined end point of neurological-etiology death or survival. Demographics and clinical factors were modeled in a derivation cohort, and backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with CED. We demonstrated model performance using area under the curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> in the derivation and validation cohorts, and assigned a simplified point-scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 638 patients in the derivation cohort, 121 (18.9%) had CED. The final model included preexisting coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.86; confidence interval [CI], 1.83–4.49; <i>P</i>≤0.001), nonshockable rhythm (OR, 1.75; CI, 1.10–2.77; P=0.017), initial ejection fraction<30% (OR, 2.11; CI, 1.32–3.37; <i>P</i>=0.002), shock at presentation (OR, 2.27; CI, 1.42–3.62; P<0.001), and ischemic time >25 minutes (OR, 1.42; CI, 0.90–2.23; P=0.13). The derivation model area under the curve was 0.73, and Hosmer-Lemeshow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> P=0.47. Outcomes were similar in the 318-patient validation cohort (area under the curve 0.68, Hosmer-Lemeshow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> P=0.41). When assigned a point for each associated factor in the derivation model, the average predicted versus observed probability of CED with a CREST score (coronary artery disease, initial heart rhythm, low ejection fraction, shock at the time of admission, and ischemic time >25 minutes) of 0 to 5 was: 7.1% versus 10.2%, 9.5% versus 11%, 22.5% versus 19.6%, 32.4% versus 29.6%, 38.5% versus 30%, and 55.7% versus 50%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The CREST model stratified patients immediately after resuscitation according to risk of a circulatory-etiology death. The tool may allow for estimation of circulatory risk and improve the triage of survivors of cardiac arrest without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction at the point of care.</p></sec>

Diagnostic Accuracy of the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score Plus D-Dimer for Acute Aortic Syndromes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are rare and severe cardiovascular emergencies with unspecific symptoms. For AASs, both misdiagnosis and over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing are key concerns, and standardized diagnostic strategies may help physicians to balance these risks. D-dimer (DD) is highly sensitive for AAS but is inadequate as a stand-alone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>. Integration of pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> probability assessment with DD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing is feasible, but the safety and efficiency of such a diagnostic strategy are currently unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter prospective observational study involving 6 hospitals in 4 countries from 2014 to 2016, consecutive outpatients were eligible if they had ≥1 of the following: chest/abdominal/back pain, syncope, perfusion deficit, and if AAS was in the differential diagnosis. The tool for pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> probability assessment was the aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS, 0–3) per current guidelines. DD was considered negative (DD−) if <500 ng/mL. Final case adjudication was based on conclusive diagnostic imaging, autopsy, surgery, or 14-day follow-up. Outcomes were the failure rate and efficiency of a diagnostic strategy for ruling out AAS in patients with ADD-RS=0/DD− or ADD-RS ≤1/DD−.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1850 patients were analyzed. Of these, 438 patients (24%) had ADD-RS=0, 1071 patients (58%) had ADD-RS=1, and 341 patients (18%) had ADD-RS >1. Two hundred forty-one patients (13%) had AAS: 125 had type A aortic dissection, 53 had type B aortic dissection, 35 had intramural aortic hematoma, 18 had aortic rupture, and 10 had penetrating aortic ulcer. A positive DD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> result had an overall sensitivity of 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.6–98.6) and a specificity of 64% (95% CI, 61.6–66.4) for the diagnosis of AAS; 8 patients with AAS had DD−. In 294 patients with ADD-RS=0/DD−, 1 case of AAS was observed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1.9) and an efficiency of 15.9% (95% CI, 14.3–17.6) for the ADD-RS=0/DD− strategy. In 924 patients with ADD-RS ≤1/DD−, 3 cases of AAS were observed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1) and an efficiency of 49.9% (95% CI, 47.7–52.2) for the ADD-RS ≤1/DD− strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Integration of ADD-RS (either ADD-RS=0 or ADD-RS ≤1) with DD may be considered to standardize diagnostic rule out of AAS.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Primary Myocardial Fibrosis as an Alternative Phenotype Pathway of Inherited Cardiac Structural Disorders
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial fibrosis is a common postmortem finding among young individuals with sudden cardiac death. Because there is no known single cause, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed the hypothesis that some cases of myocardial fibrosis in the absence of identifiable causes (primary myocardial fibrosis [PMF]) are associated with genetic variants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Tissue was obtained at autopsy from 4031 consecutive individuals with sudden cardiac death in Northern Finland, among whom PMF was the only structural finding in 145 subjects with sudden cardiac death. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing using a panel of 174 genes associated with myocardial structure and ion channel function when autopsies did not identify a secondary basis for myocardial fibrosis. All variants with an effect on protein and with a minor allele frequency <0.01 were classified as pathogenic or variants of uncertain significance on the basis of American College of Medical Genetics consensus guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 96 specimens with DNA passing quality control (66%), postmortem genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s identified 24 variants of known or uncertain significance in 26 subjects (27%). Ten were pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 10 subjects (10%), and 14 were variants of uncertain significance in 11 genes among 16 subjects (17%). Five variants were in genes associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, 6 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy–associated genes, and 11 in dilated cardiomyopathy–associated genes; 2 were not associated with these disorders. Four unique variants of uncertain significance cosegregated among multiple unrelated subjects with PMF. No pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were detected in ion channel–encoding genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A large proportion of subjects with PMF at autopsy had variants in genes associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without autopsy findings of those diseases, suggesting that PMF can be an alternative phenotypic expression of structural disease–associated genetic variants or that risk-associated fibrosis was expressing before the primary disease. These findings have clinical implications for postmortem genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing and family risk profiling.</p></sec>

Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) use emergency medical services records, death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">certif</span></strong>icates, or definitions that infer cause of death; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of death are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic deaths among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively identified all incident deaths attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital deaths, all reported by law. We obtained comprehensive records to determine whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">certif</span></strong>icates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths had no extracardiac cause of death or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 deaths were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and reported to the medical examiner. From these, we identified 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">certif</span></strong>icate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. Leading causes of death were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% (78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs (<i>P</i>=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Forty percent of deaths attributed to stated cardiac arrest were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not arrhythmic. These findings have implications for the accuracy of SCDs as defined by WHO criteria or emergency medical services records in aggregate mortality data, clinical trials, and cohort studies.</p></sec>

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. The development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention control (control; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by curve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong> of the diastolic pressure-volume curve. Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) was measured to quantify changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; control: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">educ</span></strong>ed (right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in controls (group×time <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-diastolic volume (group×time <i>P</i><0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was unchanged, providing greater stroke volume for any given filling pressure (loading×group×time <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and decreased cardiac stiffness. Regular exercise training may provide protection against the future risk of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction by preventing the increase in cardiac stiffness attributable to sedentary aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

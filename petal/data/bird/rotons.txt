The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the LHB tendon   in the bicipital groove was measured pre-operatively in both shoulders   using ultrasound.

A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> switches and transistors generate strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions that are essential for quantum circuits and networks. However, the deterministic control of an optical signal with a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> requires strong interactions with a quantum memory, which has been challenging to achieve in a solid-state platform. We demonstrate a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory. Our device consists of a semiconductor spin qubit strongly coupled to a nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic cavity. The spin qubit enables a single 63-picosecond gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> to switch a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s before the internal state of the device resets. Our results show that semiconductor nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic devices can produce strong and controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions that could enable high-bandwidth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic quantum information processing.</p>

Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium
<p>Bound states of massive particles, such as nuclei, atoms, or molecules, constitute the bulk of the visible world around us. By contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s typically only interact weakly. We report the observation of traveling three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium where the interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s are mediated by atomic Rydberg states. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> correlation and conditional phase measurements reveal the distinct bunching and phase features associated with three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> bound states. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic trimers and dimers possess shape-preserving wave functions that depend on the constituent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> number. The observed bunching and strongly nonlinear optical phase are described by an effective field theory of Rydberg-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions. These observations demonstrate the ability to realize and control strongly interacting quantum many-body states of light.</p>

Deterministic generation of a cluster state of entangled photons
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic cluster states are a resource for quantum computation based solely on single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> measurements. We use semiconductor quantum dots to deterministically generate long strings of polarization-entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in a cluster state by periodic timed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation of a precessing matter qubit. In each period, an entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> is added to the cluster state formed by the matter qubit and the previously emitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s. In our prototype device, the qubit is the confined dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>on, and it produces strings of hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in which the entanglement persists over five sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s. The measured process map characterizing the device has a fidelity of 0.81 with that of an ideal device. Further feasible improvements of this device may reduce the resources needed for optical quantum information processing.</p>

Strongly correlated quantum walks with a 12-qubit superconducting processor
<p>Quantum walks are the quantum analogs of classical random walks, which allow for the simulation of large-scale quantum many-body systems and the realization of universal quantum computation without time-dependent control. We experimentally demonstrate quantum walks of one and two strongly correlated microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in a one-dimensional array of 12 superconducting qubits with short-range interactions. First, in one-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> quantum walks, we observed the propagation of the density and correlation of the quasiparticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation of the superconducting qubit and quantum entanglement between qubit pairs. Second, when implementing two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> quantum walks by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ing two superconducting qubits, we observed the fermionization of strongly interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s from the measured time-dependent long-range anticorrelations, representing the antibunching of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s with attractive interactions. The demonstration of quantum walks on a quantum processor, using superconducting qubits as artificial atoms and tomographic readout, paves the way to quantum simulation of many-body phenomena and universal quantum computation.</p>

Imaging CF<sub>3</sub>I conical intersection and photodissociation dynamics with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>Conical intersections play a critical role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state dynamics of polyatomic molecules because they govern the reaction pathways of many nonadiabatic processes. However, ultrafast probes have lacked sufficient spatial resolution to image wave-packet trajectories through these intersections directly. Here, we present the simultaneous experimental characterization of one-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation channels in isolated CF<sub>3</sub>I molecules using ultrafast gas-phase electron diffraction. In the two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> channel, we have mapped out the real-space trajectories of a coherent nuclear wave packet, which bifurcates onto two potential energy surfaces when passing through a conical intersection. In the one-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> channel, we have resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation of both the umbrella and the breathing vibrational modes in the CF<sub>3</sub> fragment in multiple nuclear dimensions. These findings benchmark and validate ab initio nonadiabatic dynamics calculations.</p>

An integrated diamond nanophotonics platform for quantum-optical networks
<p>Efficient interfaces between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s and quantum emitters form the basis for quantum networks and enable optical nonlinearities at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> level. We demonstrate an integrated platform for scalable quantum nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics based on silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers coupled to diamond nanodevices. By placing SiV centers inside diamond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic crystal cavities, we realize a quantum-optical switch controlled by a single color center. We control the switch using SiV metastable states and observe optical switching at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> level. Raman transitions are used to realize a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> source with a tunable frequency and bandwidth in a diamond waveguide. By measuring intensity correlations of indistinguishable Raman <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s emitted into a single waveguide, we observe a quantum interference effect resulting from the superradiant emission of two entangled SiV centers.</p>

Quantum entanglement of the spin and orbital angular momentum of photons using metamaterials
<p>Metamaterials constructed from deep subwavelength building blocks have been used to demonstrate phenomena ranging from negative refractive index and ε-near-zero to cloaking, emulations of general relativity, and superresolution imaging. More recently, metamaterials have been suggested as a new platform for quantum optics. We present the use of a dielectric metasurface to generate entanglement between the spin and orbital angular momentum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s. We demonstrate the generation of the four Bell states on a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> by using the geometric phase that arises from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic spin-orbit interaction and subsequently show nonlocal correlations between two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s that interacted with the metasurface. Our results show that metamaterials are suitable for the generation and manipulation of entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> states, introducing the area of quantum optics metamaterials.</p>

Regulating the femtosecond excited-state lifetime of a single molecule
<p>The key to controlling reactions of molecules induced with the current of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip is the ultrashort intermediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed ionic state. The initial condition of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state is set by the energy and position of the injected current; thereafter, its dynamics determines the reaction outcome. We show that a STM can directly and controllably influence the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state dynamics. For the STM-induced desorption of toluene molecules from the Si(111)-7x7 surface, as the tip approaches the molecule, the probability of manipulation drops by two orders of magnitude. A two-channel quenching of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state is proposed, consisting of an invariant surface channel and a tip height–dependent channel. We conclude that picometer tip proximity regulates the lifetime of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state from 10 femtoseconds to less than 0.1 femtoseconds.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau. This method evaluates the femur medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion. When sitting cross-legged, femurs displayed internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion   from 10° to 100°. From 100°, femoral external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion was observed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was observed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The measure kinematic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial pivoting pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°. During   kneeling, a medial pivot pattern was evident. When sitting cross-legged,   a lateral pivot pattern was seen from 0° to 100°, and a medial pivot   pattern beyond 100°.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The kinematics of normal knees during high flexion are variable   according to activity.

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased activity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission increased neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, reduced GABAergic transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased activity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF exposure. Activating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA activity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated disorders.</p>

Asteroseismic detection of latitudinal differential rotation in 13 Sun-like stars

Twistable electronics with dynamically rotatable heterostructures
<p>In heterostructures of two-dimensional materials, electronic properties can vary dramatically with relative interlayer angle. This effect makes it theoretically possible to realize a new class of twistable electronics in which properties can be manipulated on demand by means of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion. We demonstrate a device architecture in which a layered heterostructure can be dynamically twisted in situ. We study graphene encapsulated by boron nitride, where, at small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion angles, the device characteristics are dominated by coupling to a long-wavelength moirééé superlattice. The ability to investigate arbitrary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion angle in a single device reveals features of the optical, mechanical, and electronic response in this system not captured in static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion studies.

Nanometer resolution imaging and tracking of fluorescent molecules with minimal photon fluxes
<p>We introduce MINFLUX, a concept for localizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> emitters in space. By probing the emitter with a local intensity minimum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation light, MINFLUX minimizes the fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s needed for high localization precision. In our experiments, 22 times fewer fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s are required as compared to popular centroid localization. In superresolution microscopy, MINFLUX attained ~1-nm precision, resolving molecules only 6 nanometers apart. MINFLUX tracking of single fluorescent proteins increased the temporal resolution and the number of localizations per trace by a factor of 100, as demonstrated with diffusing 30<i>S</i> ribosomal subunits in living <i>Escherichia coli</i>. As conceptual limits have not been reached, we expect this localization modality to break new ground for observing the dynamics, distribution, and structure of macromolecules in living cells and beyond.</p>

Imaging rotational dynamics of nanoparticles in liquid by 4D electron microscopy

We have extended 4D EM to include liquid cells without the time resolution being limited by the response of the detector. Our approach permits the imaging of the motion and morphological dynamics of a single, same particle on nanometer and ultrashort time scales. As a first application, we studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional dynamics of gold nanoparticles in aqueous solution.

Photosensitized, energy transfer-mediated organometallic catalysis through electronically excited nickel(II)
<p>Transition metal catalysis has traditionally relied on organometallic complexes that can cycle through a series of ground-state oxidation levels to achieve a series of discrete yet fundamental fragment-coupling steps. The viability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state organometallic catalysis via direct photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation has been demonstrated. Although the utility of triplet sensitization by energy transfer has long been known as a powerful activation mode in organic photochemistry, it is surprising to recognize that photosensitization mechanisms to access <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state organometallic catalysts have lagged far behind. Here, we demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state organometallic catalysis via such an activation pathway: Energy transfer from an iridium sensitizer produces an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state nickel complex that couples aryl halides with carboxylic acids.

Arthroscopic decompression not recommended in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tendinopathy has a multifactorial origin. Rejecting   the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning operative treatment   at initial presentation in the first line. Physiotherapy exercise   programmes are the accepted first line treatment. The aim of this   study was to assess the long-term additional benefits of subacromial decompression   in the treatment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tendinopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This randomised controlled trial of 140 patients (52 men, 88   women, mean age 47.1 years; 18 to 60) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tendinopathy   extended previous work up to a maximum of 13 years. The patients   were randomised into two treatment groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty   and a supervised exercise treatment and a similar supervised exercise   treatment alone. Self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS)   was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures were disability,   working ability, pain at night, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire   score and the number of painful days during the three months preceding   the final assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 90 patients (64%) returned questionnaires at a mean   12 years after randomisation. On an intention-to-treat basis, both   treatment groups reached statistically significant improvement compared   with the initial VAS for pain, but there was no significant difference   between groups. The same was true in the secondary outcome measures.   Due to group changes, the results were also analysed per protocol:   operated or not.

Satisfaction, function and repair integrity after arthroscopic <i>versus</i> mini-open rotator cuff repair
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advances in arthroscopic techniques for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff repair have   made the mini-open approach less popular. However, the mini-open   approach remains an important technique for repair for many surgeons.   The aims of this study were to compare the integrity of the repair,   the function of the shoulder and satisfaction post-operatively using   these two techniques in patients aged > 50 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 22 patients treated with mini-open and 128 patients   treated with arthroscopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff repair of July 2007 and June   2011. The mean follow-up was two years (1 to 5). Outcome was assessed   using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Simple   Shoulder Test (SST) scores, and satisfaction. The integrity of the repair   was assessed using ultrasonography. A power analysis ensured sufficient   enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no statistically significant difference between the   age, function, satisfaction, or pain scores (p > 0.05) of the two   groups.

Observation of chiral zero mode in inhomogeneous three-dimensional Weyl metamaterials
<p>Owing to the chirality of Weyl nodes, the Weyl systems can support one-way chiral zero modes under a strong magnetic field, which leads to nonconservation of chiral currents—the so-called chiral anomaly. Although promising for robust transport of optical information, the zero chiral bulk modes have not been observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics. Here we design an inhomogeneous Weyl metamaterial in which a gauge field is generated for the Weyl nodes by engineering the individual unit cells. We experimentally confirm the presence of the gauge field and observe the zero-order chiral Landau level with one-way propagation. Without breaking the time-reversal symmetry, our system provides a route for designing an artificial magnetic field in three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic Weyl systems and may have potential for device applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics.</p>

Quantum metasurface for multiphoton interference and state reconstruction
<p>Metasurfaces based on resonant nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic structures have enabled innovative types of flat-optics devices that often outperform the capabilities of bulk components, yet these advances remain largely unexplored for quantum applications. We show that nonclassical multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interferences can be achieved at the subwavelength scale in all-dielectric metasurfaces. We simultaneously image multiple projections of quantum states with a single metasurface, enabling a robust reconstruction of amplitude, phase, coherence, and entanglement of multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> polarization-encoded states. One- and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> states are reconstructed through nonlocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> correlation measurements with polarization-insensitive click detectors positioned after the metasurface, and the scalability to higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> numbers is established theoretically. Our work illustrates the feasibility of ultrathin quantum metadevices for the manipulation and measurement of multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> quantum states, with applications in free-space quantum imaging and communications.</p>

Dirac electrons in a dodecagonal graphene quasicrystal
<p>Quantum states of quasiparticles in solids are dictated by symmetry. We have experimentally demonstrated quantum states of Dirac electrons in a two-dimensional quasicrystal without translational symmetry. A dodecagonal quasicrystalline order was realized by epitaxial growth of twisted bilayer graphene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ed exactly 30°. We grew the graphene quasicrystal up to a millimeter scale on a silicon carbide surface while maintaining the single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion angle over an entire sample and successfully isolated the quasicrystal from a substrate, demonstrating its structural and chemical stability under ambient conditions. Multiple Dirac cones replicated with the 12-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional symmetry were observed in angle-resolved photoemission spectra, which revealed anomalous strong interlayer coupling with quasi-periodicity. Our study provides a way to explore physical properties of relativistic fermions with controllable quasicrystalline orders.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin laser oscillators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked lasers, microwave oscillators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin lasers. The recent advent of hybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that this silicon-based Brillouin laser enters a regime of dynamics in which optical self-oscillation produces phonon linewidth narrowing. Our results provide a platform to develop a range of applications for monolithic integration within silicon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic circuits.</p>

Structure of the maize photosystem I supercomplex with light-harvesting complexes I and II
<p>Plants regulate photosynthetic light harvesting to maintain balanced energy flux into photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII). Under light conditions favoring PSII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation, the PSII antenna, light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), is phosphorylated and forms a supercomplex with PSI core and the PSI antenna, light-harvesting complex I (LHCI). Both LHCI and LHCII then transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation energy to the PSI core. We report the structure of maize PSI-LHCI-LHCII solved by cryo–electron microscopy, revealing the recognition site between LHCII and PSI. The PSI subunits PsaN and PsaO are observed at the PSI-LHCI interface and the PSI-LHCII interface, respectively. Each subunit relays <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation to PSI core through a pair of chlorophyll molecules, thus revealing previously unseen paths for energy transfer between the antennas and the PSI core.</p>

Strong spin-photon coupling in silicon
<p>Long coherence times of single spins in silicon quantum dots make these systems highly attractive for quantum computation, but how to scale up spin qubit systems remains an open question. As a first step to address this issue, we demonstrate the strong coupling of a single electron spin and a single microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>. The electron spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric field component of the cavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> couples directly to the charge dipole of the electron in the double dot, and indirectly to the electron spin, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet. Our results provide a route to realizing large networks of quantum dot–based spin qubit registers.</p>

A topological quantum optics interface
<p>The application of topology in optics has led to a new paradigm in developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic devices with robust properties against disorder. Although considerable progress on topological phenomena has been achieved in the classical domain, the realization of strong light-matter coupling in the quantum domain remains unexplored. We demonstrate a strong interface between single quantum emitters and topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic states. Our approach creates robust counterpropagating edge states at the boundary of two distinct topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic crystals. We demonstrate the chiral emission of a quantum emitter into these modes and establish their robustness against sharp bends. This approach may enable the development of quantum optics devices with built-in protection, with potential applications in quantum simulation and sensing.</p>

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect

We report on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic spin-symmetry breaking and unexpected spin-optical transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale disordered geometric phase structure. Weak disorder induces a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic spin Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong disorder leads to spin-split modes in momentum space, a random optical Rashba effect. Study of the momentum space entropy reveals an optical transition upon reaching a critical point where the structure’s anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular topology into the disordered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the disorder strength. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic disordered geometric phase can serve as a platform for the study of different phenomena emerging from complex media involving spin-orbit coupling.</p>

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries
<p>Resonant cavities are essential building blocks governing many wave-based phenomena, but their geometry and reciprocity fundamentally limit the integration of optical devices.

Nonreciprocity originates from unidirectional edge states at the boundary between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic structures with distinct topological invariants.

Encoding of vinylidene isomerization in its anion photoelectron spectrum
<p>Vinylidene-acetylene isomerization is the prototypical example of a 1,2-hydrogen shift, one of the most important classes of isomerization reactions in organic chemistry. This reaction was investigated with quantum state specificity by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy of the vinylidene anions H<sub>2</sub>CC and D<sub>2</sub>CC and quantum dynamics calculations. Peaks in the photoelectron spectra are considerably narrower than in previous work and reveal subtleties in the isomerization dynamics of neutral vinylidene, as well as vibronic coupling with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state of vinylidene. Comparison with theory permits assignment of most spectral features to eigenstates dominated by vinylidene character. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation of the ν<sub>6</sub> in-plane rocking mode in H<sub>2</sub>CC results in appreciable tunneling-facilitated mixing with highly vibrationally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed states of acetylene, leading to broadening and/or spectral fine structure that is largely suppressed for analogous vibrational levels of D<sub>2</sub>CC.</p>

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The magnetic fields of solar-type stars are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the turbulent convective layers of stars and have a complex dependency upon stellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion rate. We have performed a set of turbulent global simulations that exhibit magnetic cycles varying systematically with stellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and luminosity. We find that the magnetic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion on turbulent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type stars.</p>

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom
<p>Integrated nonreciprocal optical components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagation direction, are key for routing signals in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic circuits. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum optical circulator operated by a single atom. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interaction between the atom and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the atom controls the operation direction of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> level. This enables, for example, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable integrated optical circuits.</p>

Enantioselective photochemistry through Lewis acid–catalyzed triplet energy transfer
<p>Relatively few catalytic systems are able to control the stereochemistry of electronically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed organic intermediates. Here we report the discovery that a chiral Lewis acid complex can catalyze triplet energy transfer from an electronically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed photosensitizer. We applied this strategy to asymmetric [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of 2′-hydroxychalcones, using tris(bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) as a sensitizer. A variety of electrochemical, computational, and spectroscopic data rule out substrate activation by means of photoinduced electron transfer and instead support a mechanism in which Lewis acid coordination dramatically lowers the triplet energy of the chalcone substrate. We expect that this approach will enable chemists to more broadly apply their detailed understanding of chiral Lewis acid catalysis to stereocontrol in reactions involving electronically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed states.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

The role of light in mediating the effects of ocean acidification on coral calcification
<p>We tested the effect of light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on the calcification and survival of <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i> recruits settled from larvae released in southern Taiwan. In March 2011, recruits were incubated at 31, 41, 70, 122 and 226 μmol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> under ambient (493 μatm) and high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> (878 μatm). After 5 days, calcification was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated as the number of living recruits. Calcification was affected by the interaction of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> with light, and at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> the response to light intensity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, the effect of light on calcification differed from that observed at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, with the result that there were large differences in calcification between 493 μatm and 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> at intermediate light intensities (<i>ca</i>. 70 μmol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), but similar rates of calcification at the highest and lowest light intensities. Survivorship was affected by light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, and was highest at 122 μmol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> in both <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> treatments, but was unrelated to calcification. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> decreased calcification of <i>P. damicornis</i> recruits at intermediate light intensities, but not at lower or higher intensities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory effects of high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on calcification at intermediate light intensities that disappear at both higher and lower light intensities.</p>

The development of a quantitative scoring system to predict whether a large-to-massive rotator cuff tear can be arthroscopically repaired
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of the study was to develop a quantitative scoring system   to predict whether a large-to-massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tear was arthroscopically   reparable prior to surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We conducted a retrospective review of the pre-operative MR imaging   and surgical records of 87 patients (87 shoulders) who underwent   arthroscopic repair of a large-to-massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tear. Patients   were divided into two groups, based on the surgical outcome of the   repair. Of the 87 patients, 53 underwent complete repair (Group   I) and 34 an incomplete repair (Group II). Pre-operative MR images   were reviewed to quantify several variables. Between-group differences   were evaluated and multiple logistic regression analysis was used   to calculate the predictive value of significant variables.

Continuous distal migration and internal rotation of the C-stem prosthesis without any adverse clinical effects
<p>In 2005, we demonstrated that the polished triple-tapered   C-stem at two years had migrated distally and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ed internally.   From that series, 33 patients have now been followed radiologically,   clinically and by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) for up to ten   years. The distal migration within the cement mantle had continued   and reached a mean of 2 mm (0.5 to 4.0) at ten years. Internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion,   also within the cement mantle, was a mean 3.8° (external 1.6° to   internal 6.6°) The cement mantle did not show any sign of migration   or loosening in relation to the femoral bone. There were no clinical   or radiological signs indicating that the migration or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion   within the cement mantle had had any adverse effects for the patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:604–8.</p>

Inducible displacement of cemented tibial components ten years after total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term inducible   displacement of cemented tibial components ten years after total   knee arthroplasty (TKA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 15 patients from a previously reported prospective   trial of fixation using radiostereometric analysis (RSA) were examined   at a mean of 11 years (10 to 11) postoperatively.

Weight-bearing RSA examinations   were also undertaken with the operated lower limb in neutral and   in maximum internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion positions. Maximum total point motion   (MTPM) was calculated for the longitudinal and inducible displacement examinations   (supine <i>versus</i> standing, standing <i>versus</i> internal   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion, and supine <i>versus</i> standing with internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All patients showed some inducible displacement.

Morphology, muscle capacity, skill, and maneuvering ability in hummingbirds
<p>How does agility evolve? This question is challenging because natural movement has many degrees of freedom and can be influenced by multiple traits. We used computer vision to record thousands of translations, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ions, and turns from more than 200 hummingbirds from 25 species, revealing that distinct performance metrics are correlated and that species diverge in their maneuvering style. Our analysis demonstrates that the enhanced maneuverability of larger species is explained by their proportionately greater muscle capacity and lower wing loading. Fast acceleration maneuvers evolve by recruiting changes in muscle capacity, whereas fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ions and sharp turns evolve by recruiting changes in wing morphology. Both species and individuals use turns that play to their strengths. These results demonstrate how both skill and biomechanical traits shape maneuvering behavior.</p>

Resonantly driven CNOT gate for electron spins
<p>Single-qubit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ions and two-qubit CNOT operations are crucial ingredients for universal quantum computing. Although high-fidelity single-qubit operations have been achieved using the electron spin degree of freedom, realizing a robust CNOT gate has been challenging because of rapid nuclear spin dephasing and charge noise. We demonstrate an efficient resonantly driven CNOT gate for electron spins in silicon. Our platform achieves single-qubit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ions with fidelities greater than 99%, as verified by randomized benchmarking. Gate control of the exchange coupling allows a quantum CNOT gate to be implemented with resonant driving in ~200 nanoseconds. We used the CNOT gate to generate a Bell state with 78% fidelity (corrected for errors in state preparation and measurement). Our quantum dot device architecture enables multi-qubit algorithms in silicon.</p>

Atomic model for the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> region of mitochondrial ATP synthase
<p>Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase produces the majority of ATP in eukaryotic cells, and its dimerization is necessary to create the inner membrane folds, or cristae, characteristic of mitochondria. Proton translocation through the membrane-embedded F<sub>O</sub> region turns the rotor that drives ATP synthesis in the soluble F<sub>1</sub> region. Although crystal structures of the F<sub>1</sub> region have illustrated how this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion leads to ATP synthesis, understanding how proton translocation produces the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion has been impeded by the lack of an experimental atomic model for the F<sub>O</sub> region. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structure of the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> complex from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> at a resolution of 3.6 angstroms. The structure clarifies how the protons travel through the complex, how the complex dimerizes, and how the dimers bend the membrane to produce cristae.</p>

High-speed plasmonic modulator in a single metal layer
<p>Plasmonics provides a possible route to overcome both the speed limitations of electronics and the critical dimensions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics. We present an all-plasmonic 116–gigabits per second electro-optical modulator in which all the elements—the vertical grating couplers, splitters, polarization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ors, and active section with phase shifters—are included in a single metal layer. The device can be realized on any smooth substrate surface and operates with low energy consumption. Our results show that plasmonics is indeed a viable path to an ultracompact, highest-speed, and low-cost technology that might find many applications in a wide range of fields of sensing and communications because it is compatible with and can be placed on a wide variety of materials.</p>

Quantum control of molecular collisions at 1 kelvin
<p>Measurement of vector correlations in molecular scattering is an indispensable tool for mapping out interaction potentials. In a coexpanded supersonic beam, we have studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ionally inelastic process wherein deuterium hydride (HD) (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) collides with molecular deuterium (D<sub>2</sub>) to form HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 1), where <i>v</i> and <i>j</i> are the vibrational and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional quantum numbers, respectively. HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) was prepared by Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage, with its bond axis aligned preferentially parallel or perpendicular to the lab-fixed relative velocity. The coexpansion brought the collision temperature down to 1 kelvin, restricting scattering to s and p partial waves. Scattering angular distributions showed a dramatic stereodynamic preference (~3:1) for perpendicular versus parallel alignment. The four-vector correlation measured between the initial and final velocities and the initial and final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional angular momentum vectors of HD provides insight into the strong anisotropic forces present in the collision process.</p>

Rotary and linear molecular motors driven by pulses of a chemical fuel
<p>Many biomolecular motors catalyze the hydrolysis of chemical fuels, such as adenosine triphosphate, and use the energy released to direct motion through information ratchet mechanisms. Here we describe chemically-driven artificial rotary and linear molecular motors that operate through a fundamentally different type of mechanism. The directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion of [2]- and [3]catenane rotary molecular motors and the transport of substrates away from equilibrium by a linear molecular pump are induced by acid-base oscillations. The changes simultaneously switch the binding site affinities and the labilities of barriers on the track, creating an energy ratchet. The linear and rotary molecular motors are driven by aliquots of a chemical fuel, trichloroacetic acid. A single fuel pulse generates 360° unidirectional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion of up to 87% of crown ethers in a [2]catenane rotary motor.</p>

Nanophotonic rare-earth quantum memory with optically controlled retrieval
<p>Optical quantum memories are essential elements in quantum networks for long-distance distribution of quantum entanglement. Scalable development of quantum network nodes requires on-chip qubit storage functionality with control of the readout time. We demonstrate a high-fidelity nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic quantum memory based on a mesoscopic neodymium ensemble coupled to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic crystal cavity. The nanocavity enables >95% spin polarization for efficient initialization of the atomic frequency comb memory and time bin–selective readout through an enhanced optical Stark shift of the comb frequencies. Our solid-state memory is integrable with other chip-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> source and detector devices for multiplexed quantum and classical information processing at the network nodes.</p>

Soft x-ray excitonics
<p>The dynamic response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ons in solids is central to modern condensed-phase physics, material sciences, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic technologies. However, study and control have hitherto been limited to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> energies lower than the fundamental band gap. Here we report application of attosecond soft x-ray and attosecond optical pulses to study the dynamics of core-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ons at the L<sub>2,3</sub> edge of Si in silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>). This attosecond x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (AXANES) technique enables direct probing of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ons’ quasiparticle character, tracking of their subfemtosecond relaxation, the measurement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>onic polarizability, and observation of dark core-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>onic states.

Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial component fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Hydroxyapatite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ings have been   applied to improve bone ingrowth in uncemented designs, but may   only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> the directly accessible surface. As peri-apatite (PA)   is solution deposited, this may increase the coverage of the implant   surface and thereby fixation. We assessed the tibial component fixation   of uncemented PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed TKAs <i>versus</i> cemented TKAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed or cemented TKAs. In 60   patients (30 in each group), radiostereometric analysis of tibial   component migration was evaluated as the primary outcome at baseline,   three months post-operatively and at one, two and five years. A   linear mixed-effects model was used to analyse the repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After five years of follow-up, one (cemented) component was revised   due to ligament instability. Overall, uncemented PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial   components migrated significantly more    (p = 0.003), with the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) at   five years being 0.62 mm (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to   0.76) for cemented tibial components and 0.97 mm (95% CI 0.81 to   1.15) for PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial components in TKA. However, between three   months and five years the cemented TKAs migrated significantly more   (p = 0.02), displaying a MTPM of 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.36) <i>versus</i> 0.13   mm (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.25) for PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial components. One implant   in each group was considered at risk for aseptic loosening due to continuous   migration after five years of follow-up, albeit with different migration   patterns for each group (i.e. higher initial migration but diminishing   over time for the PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed component <i>versus</i> gradually   increasing migration for the cemented component).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The tibial components of PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed TKAs showed more overall migration   compared with the tibial components of cemented TKAs. However, <i>post   hoc</i> analysis showed that this difference was caused by   higher migration of PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed components in the first three months,   after which a stable migration pattern was observed.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfact</span></strong>ants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfact</span></strong>ants. Lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfact</span></strong>ants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfact</span></strong>ant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfact</span></strong>ants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfact</span></strong>ants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ified by pectin methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ification. Decreased methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the seed mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYL<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ification, although its activity may be confined to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole seed. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ification in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage formation.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, represents an essential sealing component controlling water and solute movement and protecting seed from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components controlling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator controlling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during seed development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>s, and their expression requires seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed balloons (DCBs) are a predominant revascularization therapy for symptomatic femoropopliteal artery disease. Because of the differences in excipients, paclitaxel dose, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing morphologies, varying clinical outcomes have been observed with different DCBs. We report the results of 2 studies investigating the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of a new DCB to treat femoropopliteal disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study (Prospective, Randomized, Single-Blind, U.S. Multi-Center Study to Evaluate Treatment of Obstructive Superficial Femoral Artery or Popliteal Lesions With A Novel Paclitaxel-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed Percutaneous Angioplasty Balloon), 300 symptomatic patients (Rutherford class 2–4) were randomly assigned to DCB (n=200) or standard angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA]) (n=100). The primary safety end point was freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days, and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months. The primary effectiveness end point was primary patency through 12 months. In the ILLUMENATE PK study (Pharmacokinetic Study of the Stellarex Drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed Angioplasty Balloon), paclitaxel plasma concentrations were measured after last DCB deployment and at prespecified times (at 1, 4, 24 hours and at 7 and 14 days postprocedure) until no longer detectable.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study, baseline characteristics were similar between groups: 50% had diabetes mellitus, 41% were women, mean lesion length was 8.3 cm, and 44% were severely calcified.

Primary patency per Kaplan-Meier estimates at day 365 was 82.3% for DCB versus 70.9% for PTA (<i>P</i>=0.002). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was significantly lower in the DCB cohort (7.9% versus 16.8%, <i>P</i>=0.023). Improvements in ankle-brachial index, Rutherford class, and quality of life were comparable, but the PTA cohort required twice as many revascularizations.

Adaptive introgression underlies polymorphic seasonal camouflage in snowshoe hares
<p>Snowshoe hares (<i>Lepus americanus</i>) maintain seasonal camouflage by molting to a white winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, but some hares remain brown during the winter in regions with low snow cover. We show that cis-regulatory variation controlling seasonal expression of the <i>Agouti</i> gene underlies this adaptive winter camouflage polymorphism. Genetic variation at <i>Agouti</i> clustered by winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> color across multiple hare and jackrabbit species, revealing a history of recurrent interspecific gene flow. Brown winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>s in snowshoe hares likely originated from an introgressed black-tailed jackrabbit allele that has swept to high frequency in mild winter environments. These discoveries show that introgression of genetic variants that underlie key ecological traits can seed past and ongoing adaptation to rapidly changing environments.</p>

Photoinduced decarboxylative borylation of carboxylic acids
<p>The conversion of widely available carboxylic acids into versatile boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s would be highly enabling for synthesis. We found that this transformation can be effected by illuminating the <i>N</i>-hydroxyphthalimide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong> derivative of the carboxylic acid under visible light at room temperature in the presence of the diboron reagent bis(catecholato)diboron. A simple workup allows isolation of the pinacol boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>. Experimental evidence suggests that boryl radical intermediates are involved in the process. The methodology is illustrated by the transformation of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl carboxylic acids as well as a diverse range of natural-product carboxylic acids, thereby demonstrating its broad utility and functional group tolerance.</p>

Decarboxylative borylation
<p>The widespread use of alkyl boronic acids and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s is frequently hampered by the challenges associated with their preparation. We describe a simple and practical method to rapidly access densely functionalized alkyl boronate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s from abundant carboxylic substituents. This broad-scope nickel-catalyzed reaction uses the same activating principle as amide bond formation to replace a carboxylic acid moiety with a boronate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>. Application to peptides allowed expedient preparations of α-amino boronic acids, often with high stereoselectivity, thereby facilitating synthesis of the alkyl boronic acid drugs Velcade and Ninlaro as well as a boronic acid version of the iconic antibiotic vancomycin. The reaction also enabled the discovery and extensive biological characterization of potent human neutrophil elastase inhibitors, which offer reversible covalent binding properties.</p>

Radical-polar crossover reactions of vinylboron ate complexes
<p>Vinyl boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s are valuable substrates for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. However, boron-substituted alkenes have drawn little attention as radical acceptors, and the radical chemistry of vinylboron ate complexes is underexplored. We show here that carbon radicals add efficiently to vinylboron ate complexes and that their adduct radical anions undergo radical-polar crossover: A 1,2-alkyl/aryl shift from boron to the α-carbon sp<sup>2</sup> center provides secondary or tertiary alkyl boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s. In contrast to the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, a transition metal is not required, and two carbon-carbon bonds are formed. The valuable boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong> moiety remains in the product and can be used in follow-up chemistry, enlarging the chemical space of the method. The cascade uses commercial starting materials and provides access to perfluoroalkylated alcohols, γ-lactones, γ-hydroxy alkylnitriles, and compounds bearing quaternary carbon centers.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG accumulation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

The case-cohort was 61% male with a mean age of 67 years. All participants had type 2 diabetes mellitus with ≥1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional cardiovascular risk factors, and 35% had a history of macrovascular disease. Weighted Cox regression was used to identify lipid species associated with future cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death) and cardiovascular death during a 5-year follow-up period.

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of 7 lipid species to a base model (14 traditional risk factors and medications) to predict cardiovascular events increased the C statistic from 0.680 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.678–0.682) to 0.700 (95% CI, 0.698–0.702; <i>P</i><0.0001) with a corresponding continuous NRI of 0.227 (95% CI, 0.219–0.235).

Coexpression Analysis Identifies Two Oxidoreductases Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Monoterpene Acid Moiety of Natural Pyrethrin Insecticides in <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>
<p>Flowers of <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i> produce a set of compounds known collectively as pyrethrins, which are commercially important pesticides that are strongly toxic to flying insects but not to most vertebrates. A pyrethrin molecule is an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong> consisting of either trans-chrysanthemic acid or its modified form, pyrethric acid, and one of three alcohols, jasmolone, pyrethrolone, and cinerolone, that appear to be derived from jasmonic acid. Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), the first enzyme involved in the synthesis of trans-chrysanthemic acid, was characterized previously and its gene isolated. <i>TcCDS</i> produces free trans-chrysanthemol in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to trans-chrysanthemyl diphosphate, but the enzymes responsible for the conversion of trans-chrysanthemol to the corresponding aldehyde and then to the acid have not been reported. We used an RNA sequencing-based approach and coexpression correlation analysis to identify several candidate genes encoding putative trans-chrysanthemol and trans-chrysanthemal dehydrogenases. We functionally characterized the proteins encoded by these genes using a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and heterologous expression in planta to demonstrate that <i>TcADH2</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemol to trans-chrysanthemal, while <i>TcALDH1</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemal into trans-chrysanthemic acid. Transient coexpression of <i>TcADH2</i> and <i>TcALDH1</i> together with <i>TcCDS</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves results in the production of trans-chrysanthemic acid as well as several other side products. The majority (58%) of trans-chrysanthemic acid was glycosylated or otherwise modified. Overall, these data identify key steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins and demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic engineering to produce components of these defense compounds in a heterologous host.</p>

Genome-Wide Identification of <i>Medicago</i> Peptides Involved in Macronutrient Responses and Nodulation
<p>Growing evidence indicates that small, secreted peptides (SSPs) play critical roles in legume growth and development, yet the annotation of SSP-coding genes is far from complete. Systematic reannotation of the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> genome identified 1,970 homologs of established SSP gene families and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional 2,455 genes that are potentially novel SSPs, previously unreported in the literature.

Focusing on those known or suspected to act via receptor-mediated signaling, 240 nutrient-responsive and 365 nodulation-responsive Signaling-SSPs were identified, greatly expanding the number of SSP gene families potentially involved in acclimation to nutrient deficiencies and nodulation. Synthetic peptide applications were shown to alter root growth and nodulation phenotypes, revealing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional regulators of legume nutrient acquisition. Our results constitute a powerful resource enabling further investigations of specific SSP functions via peptide treatment and reverse genetics.</p>

A Violaxanthin Deepoxidase Interacts with a Viral Suppressor of RNA Silencing to Inhibit Virus Amplification
<p>RNA silencing plays a critical role against viral infection. To counteract this antiviral silencing, viruses have evolved various RNA silencing suppressors. Meanwhile, plants have evolved counter-counter defense strategies against RNA silencing suppression (RSS). In this study, the violaxanthin deepoxidase protein of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), ZmVDE, was shown to interact specifically with the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro; a viral RNA silencing suppressor) of <i>Sugarcane mosaic virus</i> (SCMV) via its mature protein region by yeast two-hybrid assay, which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells. It was demonstrated that amino acids 101 to 460 in HC-Pro and the amino acid glutamine-292 in ZmVDE mature protein were essential for this interaction. The mRNA levels of <i>ZmVDE</i> were down-regulated 75% to 65% at an early stage of SCMV infection. Interestingly, ZmVDE, which normally localized in the chloroplasts and cytoplasm, could relocalize to HC-Pro-containing aggregate bodies in the presence of HC-Pro alone or SCMV infection. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, ZmVDE could attenuate the RSS activity of HC-Pro in a specific protein interaction-dependent manner. Subsequently, transient silencing of the <i>ZmVDE</i> gene facilitated SCMV RNA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> protein accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that ZmVDE interacts with SCMV HC-Pro and attenuates its RSS activity, contributing to decreased SCMV accumulation. This study demonstrates that a host factor can be involved in secondary defense responses against viral infection in monocot plants.</p>

Cytological and Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Important Roles of <i>CLE19</i> in Pollen Exine Formation
<p>The CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE) peptide signals are required for cell-cell communication in several plant growth and developmental processes. However, little is known regarding the possible functions of the CLEs in the anther. Here, we show that a T-DNA insertional mutant, and dominant-negative (DN) and overexpression (OX) transgenic plants of the <i>CLE19</i> gene, exhibited significantly reduced anther size and pollen grain number and abnormal pollen wall formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Interestingly, the <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i> pollen grains showed a more extensively covered surface, but <i>CLE19-OX</i> pollen exine exhibited clearly missing connections in the network and lacked separation between areas that normally form the lacunae. With a combination of cell biological, genetic, and transcriptomic analyses on <i>cle19</i>, <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i>, and <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants, we demonstrated that <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants produced highly vacuolated and swollen <i>aborted microspores</i> (<i>ams</i>)-like tapetal cells, lacked lipidic tapetosomes and elaioplasts, and had abnormal pollen primexine without obvious accumulation of sporopollenin precursors. Moreover, <i>CLE19</i> is important for the normal expression of more than 1,000 genes, including the transcription factor gene <i>AMS</i>, 280 <i>AMS</i>-downstream genes, and other genes involved in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> and pollen exine formation, lipid metabolism, pollen germination, and hormone metabolism. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the <i>DN-CLE19(+/+) ams(−/−)</i> plants exhibited the <i>ams</i> anther phenotype and <i>ams(+/−)</i> partially suppressed the <i>DN-CLE19</i> transgene-induced pollen exine defects. These findings demonstrate that the proper amount of CLE19 signal is essential for the normal expression of <i>AMS</i> and its downstream gene networks in the regulation of anther development and pollen exine formation.</p>

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of chloroplast metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning chloroplast function is to establish the relationship between these two redox systems and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has antioxidant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-retarded phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant chloroplast ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in chloroplast redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons chloroplasts, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

Scanning for New BRI1 Mutations via TILLING Analysis
<p>The identification and characterization of a mutational spectrum for a specific protein can help to elucidate its detailed cellular functions. BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), a multidomain transmembrane receptor-like kinase, is a major receptor of brassinosteroids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Within the last two decades, over 20 different <i>bri1</i> mutant alleles have been identified, which helped to determine the significance of each domain within BRI1. To further understand the molecular mechanisms of BRI1, we tried to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional alleles via targeted induced local lesions in genomes. Here, we report our identification of 83 new point mutations in <i>BRI1</i>, including nine mutations that exhibit an allelic series of typical <i>bri1</i> phenotypes, from subtle to severe morphological alterations. We carried out biochemical analyses to investigate possible mechanisms of these mutations in affecting brassinosteroid signaling. A number of interesting mutations have been isolated via this study. For example, <i>bri1-702</i>, the only weak allele identified so far with a mutation in the activation loop, showed reduced autophosphorylation activity. <i>bri1-705</i>, a subtle allele with a mutation in the extracellular portion, disrupts the interaction of BRI1 with its ligand brassinolide and coreceptor BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1. <i>bri1-706</i>, with a mutation in the extracellular portion, is a subtle defective mutant. Surprisingly, root inhibition analysis indicated that it is largely insensitive to exogenous brassinolide treatment. In this study, we found that <i>bri1-301</i> possesses kinase activity in vivo, clarifying a previous report arguing that kinase activity may not be necessary for the function of BRI1. These data provide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional insights into our understanding of the early events in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Dimerization in LBD16 and LBD18 Transcription Factors Is Critical for Lateral Root Formation
<p>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKEs (hereafter referred to as LBD) are plant-specific transcription factors that play important roles in a plethora of plant growth and development. The leucine (Leu) zipper-like coiled-coil motif in the lateral organ boundaries domain of the class I LBD proteins has been proposed to mediate protein dimerization, but it has not been experimentally assessed yet. LBD16 and LBD18 have been well characterized to play important roles in lateral root development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we investigated the role of the coiled-coil motif in the dimerization of LBD16 and LBD18 and in transcriptional regulation and biological function. We built the molecular models of the coiled coil of LBD16 and LBD18, providing the probable Leu zipper models of the helix dimer. Using a variety of molecular techniques, such as bimolecular fluorescence complementation, luciferase complementation imaging, GST pull down, and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we showed that the conserved Leu or valine residues in the coiled-coil motif are critical for the dimerization of LBD16 or LBD18. Using transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress HA:LBD16 or HA:LBD16<sup>Q</sup> in <i>lbd16</i> or HA:LBD18 or HA:LBD18<sup>Q</sup> in <i>lbd18</i>, we demonstrated that the homodimerization of LBD18 mediated by the coiled-coil motif is crucial for transcriptional regulation via promoter binding and for lateral root formation. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, we found that the carboxyl-terminal region beyond the coiled-coil motif in LBD18 acts as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional dimerization domain. These results provide a molecular basis for homodimerization and heterodimerization among the 42 Arabidopsis LBD family members for displaying their biological functions.</p>

Awake1, an ABC-Type Transporter, Reveals an Essential Role for Suberin in the Control of Seed Dormancy
<p>The mother plant plays an important dynamic role in the control of dormancy of her progeny seed in response to environmental signals. In order to further understand the mechanisms by which this dormancy control takes place in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we conducted a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants that fail to enter dormancy in response to variation in temperature during seed set. We show that, for the first of these mutants, designated <i>awake1</i>, the maternal allele is required for entry into strongly dormant states and that <i>awake1</i> mutants show seed phenotypes shown previously to be associated with the loss of suberin in the seed. We identify <i>awake1</i> as an allele of <i>ABCG20</i>, an ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene required for the transport of fatty acids during suberin deposition, and show that further suberin-deficient mutants have seed dormancy defects. Seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin composition is affected by temperature during seed maturation, but this response appears to be independent of ABCG20. We conclude that seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin is essential for seed dormancy imposition by low temperature and that the exclusion of oxygen and water from the seed by the suberin and tannin layers is important for dormancy imposition.</p>

Structural and Biochemical Characterization of Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductases
<p>Cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase (CCR) catalyzes the reduction of hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s using NADPH to produce hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde precursors in lignin synthesis. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of cinnamoyl-CoA reductases from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. Although SbCCR1 displayed higher affinity for caffeoyl-CoA or <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than for feruloyl-CoA, the enzyme showed significantly higher activity for the latter substrate. Through molecular docking and comparisons between the crystal structures of the <i>Vitis vinifera</i> dihydroflavonol reductase and SbCCR1, residues threonine-154 and tyrosine-310 were pinpointed as being involved in binding CoA-conjugated phenylpropanoids. Threonine-154 of SbCCR1 and other CCRs likely confers strong substrate specificity for feruloyl-CoA over other cinnamoyl-CoA thio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s, and the T154Y mutation in SbCCR1 led to broader substrate specificity and faster turnover. Through data mining using our structural and biochemical information, four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional putative <i>CCR</i> genes were discovered from sorghum genomic data. One of these, SbCCR2, displayed greater activity toward <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than did SbCCR1, which could imply a role in the synthesis of defense-related lignin. Taken together, these findings provide knowledge about critical residues and substrate preference among CCRs and provide, to our knowledge, the first three-dimensional structure information for a CCR from a monocot species.</p>

MONENSIN SENSITIVITY1 (MON1)/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-Mediated Rab7 Activation Regulates Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD)-triggered degradation of plant tapetum is essential for microspore development and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> formation; however, little is known about the cellular mechanism regulating tapetal PCD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab7-mediated vacuolar transport of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases is crucial for tapetal PCD and pollen development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with the following evidence: (1) The <i>monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>mon1</i>) mutants, which are defective in Rab7 activation, showed impaired male fertility due to a combined defect in both tapetum and male gametophyte development. (2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and pollen. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> formation and decreased male fertility. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-mediated Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-mediated vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in defective pollen germination and tube growth. Taken together, tapetal PCD and pollen development require successful MON1/CCZ1-mediated vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

Genomic Basis of Adaptive Evolution: The Survival of Amur Ide (<i>Leuciscu</i>s <i>waleckii</i>) in an Extremely Alkaline Environment
<p>The Amur ide (<i>Leuciscus waleckii</i>) is a cyprinid fish that is widely distributed in Northeast Asia. The Lake Dali Nur population inhabits one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth, with an alkalinity up to 50 mmol/L (pH 9.6), thus providing an exceptional model with which to characterize the mechanisms of genomic evolution underlying adaptation to extreme environments. Here, we developed the reference genome assembly for <i>L. waleckii</i> from Lake Dali Nur. Intriguingly, we identified unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> genome. We also identified expansions in genes encoding egg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> proteins and natriuretic peptide receptors, possibly underlying the adaptation to extreme environmental stress. We further sequenced the genomes of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional individuals from freshwater and 18 from Lake Dali Nur populations, and we detected a total of 7.6 million SNPs from both populations. In a genome scan and comparison of these two populations, we identified a set of genomic regions under selective sweeps that harbor genes involved in ion homoeostasis, acid-base regulation, unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species elimination, and urea excretion. Our findings provide comprehensive insight into the genomic mechanisms of teleost fish that underlie their adaptation to extreme alkaline environments.</p>

Insights from the Shell Proteome: Biomineralization to Adaptation
<p>Bivalves have evolved a range of complex shell forming mechanisms that are reflected by their incredible diversity in shell mineralogy and microstructures. A suite of proteins exported to the shell matrix space plays a significant role in controlling these features, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to underpinning some of the physical properties of the shell itself. Although, there is a general consensus that a minimum basic protein tool kit is required for shell construction, to date, this remains undefined. In this study, the shell matrix proteins (SMPs) of four highly divergent bivalves (The Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>; the blue mussel, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>; the clam, <i>Mya truncata</i>, and the king scallop, <i>Pecten maximus</i>) were analyzed in an identical fashion using proteomics pipeline. This enabled us to identify the critical elements of a “basic tool kit” for calcification processes, which were conserved across the taxa irrespective of the shell morphology and arrangement of the crystal surfaces. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, protein domains controlling the crystal layers specific to aragonite and calcite were also identified. Intriguingly, a significant number of the identified SMPs contained domains related to immune functions. These were often are unique to each species implying their involvement not only in immunity, but also environmental adaptation. This suggests that the SMPs are selectively exported in a complex mix to endow the shell with both mechanical protection and biochemical defense.</p>

Comparative Genomics of the Pine Pathogens and Beetle Symbionts in the Genus <i>Grosmannia</i>
<p>Studies on beetle/tree fungal symbionts typically characterize the ecological and geographic distributions of the fungal populations. There is limited understanding of the genome-wide evolutionary processes that act within and between species as such fungi adapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess genomic evidence for such evolutionary processes by extending our recent work on <i>Grosmannia clavigera</i>, which is vectored by the mountain pine beetle and jeffrey pine beetle. We report the genome sequences of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional 11 <i>G. clavigera</i> (Gc) sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species, <i>Grosmannia</i> sp. (Gs) and Gc. The 12 fungal genomes are structurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between species. We identified 103,430 single-nucleotide variations that separated the <i>Grosmannia</i> strains into divergent Gs and Gc clades, and further divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which may represent an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional species. Comparing variable genes between these lineages, we identified truncated genes and potential pseudogenes, as well as seven genes that show evidence of positive selection. As these variable genes are involved in secondary metabolism and in detoxifying or utilizing host-tree defense chemicals (e.g., polyketide synthases, oxidoreductases, and mono-oxygenases), their variants may reflect adaptation to the specific chemistries of the host trees <i>Pinus contorta</i>, <i>P. ponderosa</i>, and <i>P. jeffreyi</i>. This work provides a comprehensive resource for developing informative markers for landscape population genomics of these ecologically and economically important fungi, and an approach that could be extended to other beetle–tree-associated fungi.</p>

Intracellular pH and its response to CO<sub>2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in symbiotic <i>versus</i> non-symbiotic coral cells
<p>Regulating intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) is critical for optimising the metabolic activity of corals, yet the mechanisms involved in pH regulation and the buffering capacity within coral cells are not well understood. Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates affects the response of pH<sub>i</sub> to <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in cells isolated from <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i>. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we simultaneously characterised the pH<sub>i</sub> response in host coral cells and their dinoflagellate symbionts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states under saturating light, with and without the photosynthetic inhibitor DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (pH 7.8) and CO<sub>2</sub>-acidified seawater conditions (decreasing pH from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, by which time the external pH (pH<sub>e</sub>) had declined to 6.8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their pH<sub>i</sub> by 0.5 pH units above control levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion (0.2 pH unit drop in pH<sub>e</sub>) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0.3–0.4 pH units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the pH<sub>i</sub> of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the pH<sub>i</sub> recovered to control levels when photsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that photosynthetic activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from cellular acidosis after exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>/low pH.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p>Oil palm is the world’s leading source of vegetable oil and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of oil palm. The genome sequence of <i>Pisifera</i> is available whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been sequenced yet. We sequenced the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-sequenced 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome sequence of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the oil palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-sequencing of 17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high genetic variation among palms from different geographical regions, but lower variation among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We mapped 10,000 SNPs on the linkage map of oil palm. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the oil palms used in breeding populations of Southeast Asia, suggesting that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this important oil crop. Our data provide a valuable resource for accelerating genetic improvement and studying the mechanism underlying phenotypic variations of important oil palm traits.</p>

Contribution of Impaired Parasympathetic Activity to Right Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

Expression of nicotinic (α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and muscarinic (muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor) receptors, and acetylcholin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ase activity were evaluated in RV (n=11) and lungs (n=7) from patients with PAH undergoing heart/lung transplantation and compared with tissue obtained from controls.

PH was induced in male rats by SU5416 (25 mg/kg subcutaneously) injection followed by 4 weeks of hypoxia. In a subgroup, sympathetic/parasympathetic modulation was assessed by power spectral analysis. At week 6, PH status was confirmed by echocardiography, and rats were randomly assigned to vehicle or treatment (both n=12). At the end of the study, echocardiography was repeated, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional RV pressure-volume measurements, along with lung, RV histological, and protein analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients with PAH with lower RV ejection fraction (<41%) had a significantly reduced heart rate recovery in comparison with patients with higher RV ejection fraction. In PAH RV samples, α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was increased and acetylcholin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ase activity was reduced versus controls. No difference in muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression was observed. Chronic PYR treatment in PH rats normalized the cardiovascular autonomic function, demonstrated by an increase in parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity. PYR improved survival, increased RV contractility, and reduced RV stiffness, RV hypertrophy, RV fibrosis, RV inflammation, and RV α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression, as well. Furthermore, PYR reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, RV afterload, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was associated with reduced local and systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RV dysfunction is associated with reduced systemic parasympathetic activity in patients with PAH, with an inadequate adaptive response of the cholinergic system in the RV. Enhancing parasympathetic activity by PYR improved survival, RV function, and pulmonary vascular remodeling in experimental PH.</p></sec>

Empagliflozin and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Established Cardiovascular Disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Urinary glucose excretion with empagliflozin decreases with declining renal function, resulting in less potency for glucose lowering in patients with kidney disease. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to standard of care. We analyzed cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in patients with prevalent kidney disease (defined as eGFR <60 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> and/or urine albumin-creatinine ratio >300 mg/g) at baseline. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional analyses were performed in subgroups by baseline eGFR (<45, 45–<60, 60–<90, ≥90 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>) and baseline urine albumin-creatinine ratio (>300, 30–≤300, <30 mg/g).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 7020 patients treated, 2250 patients had prevalent kidney disease at baseline, of whom 67% had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for >10 years, 58% were receiving insulin, and 84% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 29% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–0.98), the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99), the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 39% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.87), and the risk of all-cause hospitalization by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.92). Effects of empagliflozin on these outcomes were consistent across categories of eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio at baseline and across the 2 doses studied. The adverse event profile of empagliflozin in patients with eGFR <60 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> was consistent with the overall trial population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Empagliflozin improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality in vulnerable patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based risk factors is equivalent to an approach that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ionally incorporates adult lipid measures. We assessed and compared the utility of a risk model based solely on nonlaboratory risk factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory risk factors plus lipids for predicting high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study) and followed into adulthood when cIMT was measured (mean follow-up, 23.4 years). Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-risk plasma lipid levels were defined according to the National Chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol Education Program Expert Panel on Chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol Levels in Children. High cIMT was defined as a study-specific value ≥90th percentile. Age and sex were included in each model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In univariate models, all risk factors except for borderline high and high triglycerides in adolescence were associated with high cIMT in adulthood. In multivariable models (relative risk [95% confidence interval]), male sex (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density lipoprotein chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density lipoprotein chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density lipoprotein chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) remained significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of lipids into the nonlaboratory risk model slightly but significantly improved discrimination in predicting high cIMT compared with nonlaboratory-based risk factors only (C statistics for laboratory-based model 0.717 [95% confidence interval, 0.685–0.748] and for nonlaboratory 0.698 [95% confidence interval, 0.667–0.731]; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Nonlaboratory-based risk factors and lipids measured in adolescence independently predicted preclinical atherosclerosis in young adulthood. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of lipid measurements to traditional clinic-based risk factor assessment provided a statistically significant but clinically modest improvement on adolescent prediction of high cIMT in adulthood.</p></sec>

Perioperative Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) seems to be a contributor to mortality after noncardiac surgery. Because the vast majority of PMIs are asymptomatic, PMI usually is missed in the absence of systematic screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a prospective diagnostic study enrolling consecutive patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who had a planned postoperative stay of ≥24 hours and were considered at increased cardiovascular risk. All patients received a systematic screening using serial measurements of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T in clinical routine. PMI was defined as an absolute high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T increase of ≥14 ng/L from preoperative to postoperative measurements. Furthermore, mortality was compared among patients with PMI not fulfilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional criteria (ischemic symptoms, new ECG changes, or imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium) required for the diagnosis of spontaneous acute myocardial infarction versus those that did.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 2014 to 2015 we included 2018 consecutive patients undergoing 2546 surgeries. Patients had a median age of 74 years and 42% were women. PMI occurred after 397 of 2546 surgeries (16%; 95% confidence interval, 14%–17%) and was accompanied by typical chest pain in 24 of 397 patients (6%) and any ischemic symptoms in 72 of 397 (18%). Crude 30-day mortality was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7–12.0) in patients with PMI versus 1.5% (95% CI, 0.9–2.0) in patients without PMI (<i>P</i><0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.5–4.8) for 30-day mortality. The difference was retained at 1 year with mortality rates of 22.5% (95% CI, 17.6–27.4) versus 9.3% (95% CI, 7.9–10.7). Thirty-day mortality was comparable among patients with PMI not fulfilling any other of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional criteria required for spontaneous acute myocardial infarction (280/397, 71%) versus those with at least 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional criterion (10.4%; 95% CI, 6.7–15.7, versus 8.7%; 95% CI, 4.2–16.7; <i>P</i>=0.684).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PMI is a common complication after noncardiac surgery and, despite early detection during routine clinical screening, is associated with substantial short- and long-term mortality. Mortality seems comparable in patients with PMI not fulfilling any other of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional criteria required for spontaneous acute myocardial infarction versus those patients who do.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Associations Between Adding a Radial Artery Graft to Single and Bilateral Internal Thoracic Artery Grafts and Outcomes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Whether the use of the radial artery (RA) can improve clinical outcomes in coronary artery bypass graft surgery remains unclear. The ART (Arterial Revascularization Trial) was designed to compare survival after bilateral internal thoracic artery (BITA) over single left internal thoracic artery (SITA). In the ART, a large proportion of patients (≈20%) also received an RA graft instead of a saphenous vein graft (SVG). We aimed to investigate the associations between using the RA instead of an SVG to supplement SITA or BITA grafts and outcomes by performing a post hoc analysis of the ART.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the ART (n=3102) were classified on the basis of conduits actually received (as treated). The analysis included 2737 patients who received an RA graft (RA group; n=632) or SVG only (SVG group; n=2105) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to SITA or BITA grafts. The primary end point was the composite of myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and repeat revascularization at 5 years. Propensity score matching and stratified Cox regression were used to compare the 2 strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and repeat revascularization cumulative incidence was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1–3.4), 3.5% (95% CI, 2.1–5.0), and 4.4% (95% CI, 2.8–6.0) in the RA group and 3.4% (95% CI, 2.0–4.8), 4.0% (95% CI, 2.5–5.6), and 7.6% (95% CI, 5.5–9.7) in the SVG group, respectively. The composite end point was significantly lower in the RA group (8.8%; 95% CI, 6.5–11.0) compared with the SVG group (13.6%; 95% CI, 10.8–16.3; <i>P</i>=0.005). This association was present when an RA graft was used to supplement both SITA and BITA grafts (interaction <i>P</i>=0.62).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This post hoc ART analysis showed that an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional RA was associated with lower risk for midterm major adverse cardiac events when used to supplement SITA or BITA grafts.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.situ.ox.ac.uk/surgical-trials/art</ext-link>.

Prevention of Stroke with the Addition of Ezetimibe to Statin Therapy in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients who experience an acute coronary syndrome are at heightened risk of recurrent ischemic events, including stroke. Ezetimibe improved cardiovascular outcomes when added to statin therapy in patients stabilized after acute coronary syndrome. We investigated the efficacy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of ezetimibe to simvastatin for the prevention of stroke and other adverse cardiovascular events in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), with a focus on patients with a stroke before randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome were randomized to a placebo/simvastatin or ezetimibe/simvastatin regimen and followed for a median of 6 years. Treatment efficacy was assessed for the entire population and by subgroups for the first and total (first and subsequent) events for the end points of stroke of any etiology, stroke subtypes, and the primary trial end point at 7 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 18 144 patients, 641 (3.5%) experienced at least 1 stroke; most were ischemic (527, 82%). Independent predictors of stroke included prior stroke, older age, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, and renal dysfunction. There was a nonsignificant reduction in the first event of stroke of any etiology (4.2% versus 4.8%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.052) with ezetimibe/simvastatin versus placebo/simvastatin, driven by a significant 21% reduction in ischemic stroke (3.4% versus 4.1%; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.008) and a nonsignificant increase in hemorrhagic stroke (0.8% versus 0.6%; HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.93–2.04; <i>P</i>=0.11). Evaluating total events, including the first and all recurrent strokes, ezetimibe/simvastatin reduced stroke of any etiology (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.029) and ischemic stroke (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.003). Patients who had experienced a stroke prior to randomization were at a higher risk of recurrence and demonstrated an absolute risk reduction of 8.6% for stroke of any etiology (10.2% versus 18.8%; number needed to treat=12; HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38–0.95; <i>P</i>=0.030) and 7.6% for ischemic stroke (8.7% versus 16.3%; number needed to treat=13; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31–0.86; <i>P</i>=0.011) with ezetimibe added to simvastatin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of ezetimibe to simvastatin in patients stabilized after acute coronary syndrome reduces the frequency of ischemic stroke, with a particularly large effect seen in patients with a prior stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

The Fluid Mechanics of Transcatheter Heart Valve Leaflet Thrombosis in the Neosinus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transcatheter heart valve (THV) thrombosis has been increasingly reported. In these studies, thrombus quantification has been based on a 2-dimensional assessment of a 3-dimensional phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Postprocedural, 4-dimensional, volume-rendered CT data of patients with CoreValve, Evolut R, and SAPIEN 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement enrolled in the RESOLVE study (Assessment of Transcatheter and Surgical Aortic Bioprosthetic Valve Dysfunction With Multimodality Imaging and Its Treatment with Anticoagulation) were included in this analysis. Patients on anticoagulation were excluded. SAPIEN 3 and CoreValve/Evolut R patients with and without hypoattenuated leaflet thickening were included to study differences between groups. Patients were classified as having THV thrombosis if there was any evidence of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening. Anatomic and THV deployment geometries were analyzed, and thrombus volumes were computed through manual 3-dimensional reconstruction. We aimed to identify and evaluate risk factors that contribute to THV thrombosis through the combination of retrospective clinical data analysis and in vitro imaging in the space between the native and THV leaflets (neosinus).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAPIEN 3 valves with leaflet thrombosis were on average 10% further expanded (by diameter) than those without (95.5±5.2% versus 85.4±3.9%; <i>P</i><0.001). However, this relationship was not evident with the CoreValve/Evolut R. In CoreValve/Evolut Rs with thrombosis, the thrombus volume increased linearly with implant depth (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.7, <i>P</i><0.001). This finding was not seen in the SAPIEN 3. The in vitro analysis showed that a supraannular THV deployment resulted in a nearly 7-fold decrease in stagnation zone size (velocities <0.1 m/s) when compared with an intraannular deployment. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the in vitro model indicated that the size of the stagnation zone increased as cardiac output decreased.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement thrombosis is a multifactorial process involving foreign materials, patient-specific blood chemistry, and complex flow patterns, our study indicates that deployed THV geometry may have implications on the occurrence of thrombosis. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, a supraannular neosinus may reduce thrombosis risk because of reduced flow stasis. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional prospective studies are needed to further develop strategies for minimizing thrombus burden, these results may help identify patients at higher thrombosis risk and aid in the development of next-generation devices with reduced thrombosis risk.</p></sec>

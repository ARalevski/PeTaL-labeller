Pollen-Expressed Leucine-Rich Repeat Extensins Are Essential for Pollen Germination and Growth
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth, the walls of the tube provide the mechanical strength resisting turgor pressure to protect two sperm cells. Cell wall proteins may play an important role in this process. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube cell wall proteins known as leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) harbor a leucine-rich repeat domain and an extensin domain. In this study, the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed LRXs, LRX8, LRX9, LRX10, and LRX11 (LRX8–11), were characterized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>LRX8–11</i> displayed a consistent express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pattern in mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes. In a phenotypic analysis of four single mutants, six double mutants, four triple mutants, and a quadruple mutant, the triple and quadruple mutant plants displayed markedly reduced seed set and decreased male transmiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> efficiency accompanied by compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth. GFP-fused LRX8, LRX10, and LRX11 were found to be localized to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube cell walls. An immunohistochemical analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube cell wall polysaccharides showed an increase in the amount of rhamnogalacturonan I in the subapical walls of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes of the <i>lrx9 lrx10 lrx11</i> and <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutants and a decrease in the content of fucosylated xyloglucans in <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> compared with wild-type plants. Moreover, the callose content in the apical walls of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes increased in the <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutant. In conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, we propose that LRX8–11 funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> synergistically to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube cell wall inte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grit</span></strong>y; thus, they play critical roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth.</p>

<i>MtNODULE ROOT1</i> and <i>MtNODULE ROOT2</i> Are Essential for Indeterminate Nodule Identity
<p>Symbiotic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between legume plants and rhizobia result in the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nitrogen-fixing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, but the molecular actors and the mechanisms allowing for the maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e identity are poorly understood. <i>Medicago truncatula <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>E ROOT1</i> (<i>MtNOOT1</i>), <i>Pisum sativum COCHLEATA1</i> (<i>PsCOCH1</i>), and <i>Lotus japonicus NOOT-BOP-COCH-LIKE1</i> (<i>LjNBCL1</i>) are orthologs of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtBLADE-ON-PETIOLE1/2</i> and are members of the <i>NBCL</i> gene family, which has conserved roles in plant development and is essential for indeterminate and determinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e identity in legumes. The loss of funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>MtNOOT1</i>, <i>PsCOCH1</i>, and <i>LjNBCL1</i> triggers a partial loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e identity characterized by the development of ectopic roots arising from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e vascular meristems. Here, we report the identificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and characterizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a second gene involved in regulating indeterminate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e identity in <i>M. truncatula</i>, <i>MtNOOT2</i>. <i>MtNOOT2</i> is the paralog of <i>MtNOOT1</i> and belongs to a second legume-specific <i>NBCL</i> subclade, the <i>NBCL2</i> clade. <i>MtNOOT2</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was induced during early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and it was expressed primarily in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e central meristem. <i>Mtnoot2</i> mutants did not present any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particul</span></strong>ar symbiotic phenotype; however, the loss of funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of both <i>MtNOOT1</i> and <i>MtNOOT2</i> resulted in the complete loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e identity and was accompanied by drastic changes in the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of symbiotic, defense, and root apical meristem marker genes. <i>Mtnoot1 noot2</i> double mutants developed only nonfixing root-like structures that were no longer able to host symbiotic rhizobia.

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in angiosperms, rapid tip growth in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated organizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the actin cytoskeleton within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube plays a crucial role in this polarized process. However, the mechanism underlying the polarity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-organizing protein, Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth by modulating the polarity and distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the F-actin array. The rice <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth and a decreased germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> rate of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes display a disorganized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin polarity during tip growth. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube, which is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth and polarity as well as F-actin organizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Furthermore, the direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth via modulating F-actin organizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and array orientat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in rice.

Cytological and Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Important Roles of <i>CLE19</i> in Pollen Exine Formation
<p>The CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE) peptide signals are required for cell-cell communicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in several plant growth and developmental processes. However, little is known regarding the possible funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the CLEs in the anther. Here, we show that a T-DNA insert<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al mutant, and dominant-negative (DN) and overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (OX) transgenic plants of the <i>CLE19</i> gene, exhibited significantly reduced anther size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> number and abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Interestingly, the <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s showed a more extensively covered surface, but <i>CLE19-OX</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine exhibited clearly missing connect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the network and lacked separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between areas that normally form the lacunae. With a combinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of cell biological, genetic, and transcriptomic analyses on <i>cle19</i>, <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i>, and <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants, we demonstrated that <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants produced highly vacuolated and swollen <i>aborted microspores</i> (<i>ams</i>)-like tapetal cells, lacked lipidic tapetosomes and elaioplasts, and had abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> primexine without obvious accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of sporo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>in precursors. Moreover, <i>CLE19</i> is important for the normal express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of more than 1,000 genes, including the transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor gene <i>AMS</i>, 280 <i>AMS</i>-downstream genes, and other genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> coat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, lipid metabolism, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and hormone metabolism. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, the <i>DN-CLE19(+/+) ams(−/−)</i> plants exhibited the <i>ams</i> anther phenotype and <i>ams(+/−)</i> partially suppressed the <i>DN-CLE19</i> transgene-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine defects. These findings demonstrate that the proper amount of CLE19 signal is essential for the normal express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>AMS</i> and its downstream gene networks in the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of anther development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

SIPP, a Novel Mitochondrial Phosphate Carrier, Mediates in Self-Incompatibility
<p>In Solanaceae, the <i>S</i>-specific interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between the pistil S-RNase and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <i>S</i>-Locus F-box protein controls self-incompatibility (SI). Although this interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> defines the specificity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> reject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> response, the identificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of three pistil essential modifier genes unlinked to the <i>S</i>-locus (<i>HT-B</i>, <i>120K</i>, and <i>NaStEP</i>) unveils a higher degree of complexity in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> reject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathway. We showed previously that NaStEP, a stigma protein with homology with Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, is essential to SI in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. During pollinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, NaStEP is taken up by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes, where potential interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube proteins might underlie its funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Here, we identified NaSIPP, a mitochondrial protein with phosphate transporter activity, as a novel NaStEP-interacting protein. Coexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of NaStEP and NaSIPP in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes showed interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the mitochondria, although when expressed alone, NaStEP remains mostly cytosolic, implicating NaSIPP-mediated translocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of NaStEP into the organelle. The <i>NaSIPP</i> transcript is detected specifically in mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> of <i>Nicotiana</i> spp.; however, in self-compatible plants, this gene has accumulated mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, so its coding reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is unlikely to produce a funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al protein. RNA interference suppress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of NaSIPP in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s disrupts the SI by preventing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model whereby the NaStEP and NaSIPP interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, in incompatible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes, might destabilize the mitochondria and contribute to arrest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth.</p>

EXO70C2 Is a Key Regulatory Factor for Optimal Tip Growth of Pollen
<p>The exocyst, a eukaryotic tethering complex, coregulates targeted exocytosis as an effector of small GTPases in polarized cell growth. In land plants, several exocyst subunits are encoded by double or triple paralogs, culminating in tens of EXO70 paralogs. Out of 23 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> EXO70 isoforms, we analyzed seven isoforms expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>. Genetic and microscopic analyses of single mutants in <i>EXO70A2</i>, <i>EXO70C1</i>, <i>EXO70C2</i>, <i>EXO70F1</i>, <i>EXO70H3</i>, <i>EXO70H5</i>, and <i>EXO70H6</i> genes revealed that only a loss-of-funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <i>EXO70C2</i> allele resulted in a significant male-specific transmiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> defect (segregat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> 40%:51%:9%) due to aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth. Mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes grown in vitro exhibited an enhanced growth rate and a decreased thickness of the tip cell wall, causing tip bursts. However, <i>exo70C2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes could frequently recover and restart their speedy elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, resulting in a repetitive stop-and-go growth dynamics. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-specific deplet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the closest paralog, <i>EXO70C1</i>, using artificial microRNA in the <i>exo70C2</i> mutant background, resulted in a complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-specific transmiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> defect, suggesting redundant funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of EXO70C1 and EXO70C2. Both EXO70C1 and EXO70C2, GFP tagged and expressed under the control of their native promoters, localized in the cytoplasm of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes, and also root trichoblast cells. The express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of EXO70C2-GFP complemented the aberrant growth of <i>exo70C2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes. The absent EXO70C2 interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with core exocyst subunits in the yeast two-hybrid assay, cytoplasmic localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and genetic effect suggest an unconvent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al EXO70 funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> possibly as a regulator of exocytosis outside the exocyst complex. In conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, EXO70C2 is a novel factor contributing to the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of optimal tip growth of Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes.</p>

Metabolic Control of Tobacco Pollination by Sugars and Invertases
<p>Pollinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in flowering plants is initiated by germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s on stigmas followed by fast growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes representing highly energy-consuming processes. The symplastic isolat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s and tubes requires import of Suc available in the apoplast. We show that the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al coupling of Suc cleavage by invertases and uptake of the released hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and immunolocalizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo support the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al coupling in supplying carbohydrates for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and tube growth evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Detect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk between male and female tissues and supported the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Tissue-specific express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of an invertase inhibitor and addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the chemical invertase inhibitor miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously available Suc into the germinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after cleavage by extracellular invertase. Reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular invertase activity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, whereas Suc is supporting tube growth, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of pollinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by carbohydrates.</p>

Aerosol-driven droplet concentrations dominate coverage and water of oceanic low-level clouds

We introduce a methodology for ascribing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cloud</span></strong> properties to CCN and isolating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> effects from meteorological effects. Its applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> showed that for a given meteorology, CCN explains three-fourths of the variability in the radiative cooling effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cloud</span></strong>s, mainly through affecting shallow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cloud</span></strong> cover and water path. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cloud</span></strong> radiative forcing to CCN than previously reported, which means too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This suggests the existence of compensating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> warming effects yet to be discovered, possibly through deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cloud</span></strong>s.</p>

<i>INCREASING NODULE SIZE1</i> Expression Is Required for Normal Rhizobial Symbiosis and Nodule Development

Here, we cloned a candidate gene underlying a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> quantitative trait locus in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), <i>INCREASING <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>E SIZE1</i> (<i>GmINS1</i>). <i>GmINS1</i> encodes a cell wall β-expansin and is expressed primarily in vascular bundles, along with cortical and parenchyma cells of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms distinguishing the two parents were found in the <i>GmINS1</i> promoter reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Among them, single-nucleotide polymorphism A/C has a significant effect on <i>GmINS1</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the parental genotype P2, based on β-glucuronidase activity and promoter delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> analysis. The express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>GmINS1</i> and the P2 genotype promoter was strongly associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development, not only in the parents but also in 40 progeny lines and 40 genotypes selected from a soybean core collect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>GmINS1</i> resulted in increases in the number, biomass, infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> cell abundance, and nitrogenase activity of large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es and subsequently changed the nitrogen content and biomass of soybean plants. <i>GmINS1</i> suppress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> via RNA interference had the opposite effect. Double suppress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>GmEXPB2</i> and <i>GmINS1</i> dramatically inhibited soybean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Our results reveal that <i>GmINS1</i> is a critical gene in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development and that <i>GmEXPB2</i> and <i>GmINS1</i> synergistically control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in soybean. Our findings shed light on the genetic basis of soybean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and provide a candidate gene for optimizing BNF capacity through molecular breeding in soybean.</p>

Ultrastructural studies showed that vacuolar fiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> mitosis I was compromised in <i>vac14</i> mutant microspores, which led to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> abort<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

A Putative Protein <i>O</i>-Fucosyltransferase Facilitates Pollen Tube Penetration through the Stigma<i>–</i>Style Interface
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-pistil interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in angiosperms, the male gametophyte (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>) germinates to produce a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube. To fertilize ovules located within the female pistil, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube must physically penetrate specialized tissues. Whereas the process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube penetrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> through the pistil has been anatomically well described, the genetic regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gene, <i>O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>AtOFT1</i>), which plays a key role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube penetrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> through the stigma-style interface. Semi-in vivo growth assays demonstrate that <i>oft1</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes have a reduced ability to penetrate the stigma-style interface, leading to a nearly 2,000-fold decrease in <i>oft1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> transmiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> efficiency and a 5- to 10-fold decreased seed set. We also demonstrate that AtOFT1 is localized to the Golgi apparatus, indicating its potential role in cellular glycosylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> events. Finally, we demonstrate that <i>AtOFT1</i> and other similar Arabidopsis genes represent a novel clade of sequences related to metazoan protein <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferases and that mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of residues that are important for <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferase activity compromises AtOFT1 funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in vivo. The results of this study elucidate a physiological funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> for AtOFT1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube penetrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> through the stigma-style interface and highlight the potential importance of protein <i>O</i>-glycosylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> events in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-pistil interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

MtLAX2, a Functional Homologue of the Arabidopsis Auxin Influx Transporter AUX1, Is Required for Nodule Organogenesis
<p>Most legume plants can form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, specialized lateral organs that form on roots, and house nitrogen-fixing bacteria collectively called rhizobia. The uptake of the phytohormone auxin into cells is known to be crucial for development of lateral roots. To test the role of auxin influx in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> we used the auxin influx inhibitors 1-naphthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA) and 2-NOA, which we found reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>Medicago truncatula.</i> This suggested the possible involvement of the AUX/LAX family of auxin influx transporters in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> studies identified <i>MtLAX2</i>, a paralogue of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AUX1</i>, as being induced at early stages of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development. <i>MtLAX2</i> is expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e primordia, the vasculature of developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, and at the apex of mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. The <i>MtLAX2</i> promoter contains several auxin response elements, and treatment with indole-acetic acid strongly induces <i>MtLAX2</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in roots. <i>mtlax2</i> mutants displayed root phenotypes similar to Arabidopsis <i>aux1</i> mutants, including altered root gravitropism, fewer lateral roots, shorter root hairs, and auxin resistance. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, the activity of the synthetic DR5-GUS auxin reporter was strongly reduced in <i>mtlax2</i> roots. Following inoculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with rhizobia, <i>mtlax2</i> roots developed fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, had decreased DR5-GUS activity associated with infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> sites, and had decreased express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the early auxin responsive gene <i>ARF16a</i>. Our data indicate that MtLAX2 is a funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al analog of Arabidopsis AUX1 and is required for the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of auxin during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in tissues underlying sites of rhizobial infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

The MicroRNA390/TAS3 Pathway Mediates Symbiotic Nodulation and Lateral Root Growth
<p>Legume roots form two types of postembryonic organs, lateral roots and symbiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is the result of the interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of legumes with rhizobia and requires the mitotic activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and differentiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of root cells as well as an independent, but coordinated, program that allows infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by rhizobia. MicroRNA390 (miR390) is an evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>arily conserved microRNA that targets the <i>Trans-Acting Short Interference RNA3</i> (<i>TAS3</i>) transcript. Cleavage of <i>TAS3</i> by ARGONAUTE7 results in the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of trans-acting small interference RNAs, which target mRNAs encoding AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR2 (ARF2), ARF3, and ARF4. Here, we show that activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the miR390/<i>TAS3</i> regulatory module by overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of miR390 in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> promotes lateral root growth but prevents <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e organogenesis, rhizobial infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and the induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of two key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> genes, <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Signaling Pathway1</i> (<i>NSP1</i>) and <i>NSP2</i>. Accordingly, inactivat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the miR390/<i>TAS3</i> module, either by express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a miR390 target mimicry construct or mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in <i>ARGONAUTE7</i>, enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and rhizobial infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, alters the spatial distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, and increases the percentage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es with multiple meristems.

Gametophytic Pollen Tube Guidance: Attractant Peptides, Gametic Controls, and Receptors
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube guidance in flowering plants is a unique and critical process for successful sexual reproduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube that grows from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>, which is the male gametophyte, precisely navigates to the embryo sac, which is the female gametophyte, within the pistil. Recent advances have clarified the molecular framework of gametophytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube guidance. Multiple species-specific attractant peptides are secreted from synergid cells, the proper development and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of which are regulated by female gametes. Multiple receptor-like kinases on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube tip are involved in sensing species-specific attractant peptides. In this Update article, recent progress in our understanding of the mechanism of gametophytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube guidance is reviewed, including attract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by synergid cells, control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube guidance by female gametes, and direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al growth of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube by direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al cue sensing.

Secretory COPII Protein SEC31B Is Required for Pollen Wall Development
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall protects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s from abiotic and biotic stresses. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall development, tapetal cells play a vital role by secreting proteins, signals, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall material to ensure microspore development. But the regulatory mechanism underlying the secretory pathway of the tapetum is largely unknown. Here, we characterize the essential role of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) COPII protein SECRETORY31B (SEC31B) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall development and the secretory activity of tapetal cells. The sporophyte-controlled <i>atsec31b</i> mutant exhibits severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> and seed abort<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Transmiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> electron microscopy observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> indicates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant is disrupted significantly. AtSEC31B is a funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al COPII protein revealed by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit site localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with AtSEC13A, and retarded ER-Golgi protein trafficking in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant. A genetic tapetum-specific rescue assay indicates that AtSEC31B funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s primarily in the tapetum. Moreover, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of AtSEC31B interrupted the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the ER-derived tapetosome and altered the locat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER9 protein in the tapetum. Therefore, this work demonstrates that AtSEC31B plays a vital role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall development by regulating the secretory pathway of the tapetal cells.</p>

Segregation-induced ordered superstructures at general grain boundaries in a nickel-bismuth alloy
<p>The properties of materials change, sometimes catastrophically, as alloying elements and impurities accumulate preferentially at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries. Studies of bicrystals show that regular atomic patterns often arise as a result of this solute segregat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high-symmetry boundaries, but it is not known whether superstructures exist at general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries in polycrystals. In bismuth-doped polycrystalline nickel, we found that ordered, segregat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundary superstructures occur at randomly selected general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries, and that these reconstruct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are driven by the orientat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the terminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> surfaces rather than by lattice matching between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s. This discovery shows that adsorbate-induced superstructures are not limited to special <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries but may exist at a variety of general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries, and hence they can affect the performance of polycrystalline engineering alloys.</p>

SMALL AUXIN UP RNA62/75 Are Required for the Translation of Transcripts Essential for Pollen Tube Growth
<p>Successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is critical for double fertilizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, but the biological funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube genes and the regulatory machinery underlying this crucial process are largely unknown. A previous translatomic study revealed two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAUR</i> (<i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i>) genes, <i>SAUR62</i> and <i>SAUR75</i>, whose express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is up-regulated by pollinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Here, we found that both SAUR62 and SAUR75 localized mainly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube nuclei. The siliques of homozygous <i>saur62</i> (<i>saur62/−</i>), <i>saur75</i> (<i>saur75/−</i>), and the <i>SAUR62</i>/<i>75</i> RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown line had many aborted seeds. These lines had normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> viability but defective in vitro and in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth, with branching phenotypes. Immunoprecipitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with transgenic SAUR62/75-GFP flowers revealed ribosomal protein RPL12 family members as potential interacting partners, and their individual interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were confirmed further by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> assays. Polysome profiling showed reduced 80S ribosome abundance in homozygous <i>saur62</i>, <i>saur75</i>, <i>ribosomal large subunit12c</i>, and <i>SAUR62/75</i> RNAi flowers, suggesting that SAUR62/75 play roles in ribosome assembly. To clarify their roles in translat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, we analyzed total proteins from RNAi versus wild-type flowers by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, revealing significantly reduced express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of factors participating in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube wall biogenesis and F-actin dynamics, which are critical for the elastic properties of tube elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

Here, we performed a thorough transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of stored and translated transcripts in three subcellular compartments of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), long-term storage EDTA/puromycin-resistant particles, translating polysomes, and free ribo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nuclear particl</span></strong>es, throughout tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development and in in vitro-growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes. We demonstrated that the composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the aforement<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ed complexes is not rigid and that numerous transcripts were redistributed among these complexes during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development, which may represent an important mechanism of translat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Therefore, we defined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> sequestrome as a distinct and highly dynamic compartment for the storage of stable, translat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally repressed transcripts and demonstrated its dynamics. We propose that EDTA/puromycin-resistant particle complexes represent aggregated nontranslating monosomes as the primary mediators of messenger RNA sequestrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Such organizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is extremely useful in fast tip-growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes, where rapid and orchestrated protein synthesis must take place in specific reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

The ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 Complex Mediates Pollen Tube Growth by Coordinating Vacuolar Targeting and Organization
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth is an essential step for successful plant reproduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Vacuolar trafficking and dynamic organizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth; however, the key proteins involved in these processes are not well understood. Here, we report that the ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 (AP-3) complex and its tonoplast cargo PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10) are critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). AP-3 is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of four subunits, δ, β, µ, and σ. AP-3 regulates tonoplast targeting of several cargoes, such as PAT10. We show that funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al loss of any of the four AP-3 subunits reduces plant fertility. In <i>ap-3</i> mutants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development was normal but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth was compromised, leading to reduced male transmiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al loss of <i>PAT10</i> caused a similar reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth, suggesting that the tonoplast associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of PAT10 mediated by AP-3 is crucial for this process. Indeed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth was reduced significantly due to <i>AP-3</i> loss of funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, consistent with the abnormal targeting of CALCINUERIN B-LIKE2 (CBL2) and CBL3, whose tonoplast associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> depends on PAT10. Furthermore, we show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes of <i>ap-3</i> mutants have vacuoles with simplified tubules and bulbous structures, indicating that AP-3 affects vacuolar organizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Our results demonstrate a role for AP-3 in plant reproduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and provide insights into the role of vacuoles in polarized cell growth.</p>

<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for symbiotic nitrogen fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in legume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, where it is required for the activity of bacterial nitrogenase, plant leghemoglobin, respiratory oxidases, and other Fe proteins in both organisms. Fe solubility and transport within and between plant tissues is facilitated by organic chelators, such as nicotianamine and citrate. We have characterized a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e-specific citrate transporter of the multidrug and toxic compound extrus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> family, MtMATE67 of <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. The MtMATE67 gene was induced early during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development and expressed primarily in the invas<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> zone of mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. The MtMATE67 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e cells and also the symbiosome membrane surrounding bacteroids in infected cells. In oocytes, MtMATE67 transported citrate out of cells in an Fe-activated manner. Loss of <i>MtMATE67</i> gene funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> resulted in accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Fe in the apoplasm of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e cells and a substantial decrease in symbiotic nitrogen fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and plant growth. Taken together, the results point to a primary role of MtMATE67 in citrate efflux from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e cells in response to an Fe signal. This efflux is necessary to ensure Fe(III) solubility and mobility in the apoplasm and uptake into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e cells. Likewise, MtMATE67-mediated citrate transport into the symbiosome space would increase the solubility and availability of Fe(III) for rhizobial bacteroids.</p>

Extreme Suppression of Lateral Floret Development by a Single Amino Acid Change in the VRS1 Transcription Factor
<p>Increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield is an endless challenge for cereal crop breeding. In barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> number is controlled mainly by <i>Six-rowed spike 1</i> (<i>Vrs1</i>), which encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper class I transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor. However, little is known about the genetic basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size. Here, we show that extreme suppress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of lateral florets contributes to enlarged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s in <i>deficiens</i> barley. Through a combinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of fine-mapping and resequencing of <i>deficiens</i> mutants, we have identified that a single amino acid substitut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at a putative phosphorylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> site in VRS1 is responsible for the <i>deficiens</i> phenotype. <i>deficiens</i> mutant alleles confer an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size, a reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in plant height, and a significant increase in thousand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> weight in contemporary cultivated germplasm. Haplotype analysis revealed that barley carrying the <i>deficiens</i> allele (<i>Vrs1.t1</i>) originated from two-rowed types carrying the <i>Vrs1.b2</i> allele, predominantly found in germplasm from northern Africa. In situ hybridizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>histone H4</i>, a marker for cell cycle or proliferat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, showed weaker express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the lateral spikelets compared with central spikelets in <i>deficiens</i>. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a number of <i>histone</i> superfamily genes were up-regulated in the <i>deficiens</i> mutant, suggesting that enhanced cell proliferat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the central spikelet may contribute to larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s. Our data suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield can be improved by suppressing the development of specific organs that are not positively involved in sink/source relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ships.</p>

MAP Kinase PrMPK9-1 Contributes to the Self-Incompatibility Response
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) form important signaling modules for a variety of cellular responses in eukaryotic cells. In plants, MAPKs play key roles in growth and development as well as in immunity/stress responses. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-pistil interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are critical early events regulating pollinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and fertilizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and involve many signaling events. Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism to prevent self-fertilizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and inbreeding in higher plants and also is known to utilize signaling to achieve incompatible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> reject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Although several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed MAPKs exist, very little is known about their funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We previously identified a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed MAPK (p56) from <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> that was rapidly activated during SI; several studies implicated its role in signaling to SI-induced programmed cell death involving a DEVDase. However, to date, the identity of the MAPK involved has been unknown. Here, we have identified and cloned a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed <i>P. rhoeas</i> threonine-aspartate-tyrosine (TDY) MAPK, <i>PrMPK9-1</i>. Rather few data relating to the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TDY MAPKs in plants currently exist. We provide evidence that <i>PrMPK9-1</i> has a cell type-specific funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, with a distinct role from <i>AtMPK9</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first study implicating a funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> for a TDY MAPK in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>. We show that PrMPK9-1 corresponds to p56 and demonstrate that it is funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally involved in mediating SI in <i>P. rhoeas</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>: PrMPK9-1 is a key regulator for SI in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> and acts upstream of programmed cell death involving actin and activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a DEVDase. Our study provides an important advance in elucidating funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al roles for this class of MAPKs.</p>

Cardiovascular Consequences of Childhood Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure: Prevailing Evidence, Burden, and Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although public health programs have led to a substantial decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking, the adverse health effects of tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong> exposure are by no means a thing of the past. In the United States, 4 of 10 school-aged children and 1 of 3 adolescents are involuntarily exposed to secondhand tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong> (SHS), with children of minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in low-socioeconomic-status households being disproport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ately affected (68% and 43%, respectively). Children are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particul</span></strong>arly vulnerable, with little control over home and social environment, and lack the understanding, agency, and ability to avoid SHS exposure on their own volit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>; they also have physiological or behavioral characteristics that render them especially susceptible to effects of SHS. Side-stream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong> (the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong> emanating from the burning end of the cigarette), a major component of SHS, contains a higher concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of some toxins than mainstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong> (inhaled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>r directly), making SHS potentially as dangerous as or even more dangerous than direct smoking. Compelling animal and human evidence shows that SHS exposure during childhood is detrimental to arterial funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and structure, resulting in premature atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular consequences. Childhood SHS exposure is also related to impaired cardiac autonomic funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and changes in heart rate variability. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, childhood SHS exposure is associated with clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Individualized intervent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to reduce childhood exposure to SHS are shown to be at least modestly effective, as are broader-based policy initiatives such as community smoking bans and increased taxat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>The purpose of this statement is to summarize the available evidence on the cardiovascular health consequences of childhood SHS exposure; this will support ongoing efforts to further reduce and eliminate SHS exposure in this vulnerable populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

A Nanoparticle-Based Combination Chemotherapy Delivery System for Enhanced Tumor Killing by Dynamic Rewiring of Signaling Pathways

Enhanced thermal stability of nanograined metals below a critical grain size
<p>The limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>ed materials is their strong tendency to coarsen at elevated temperatures. As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size decreases into the nanoscale, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> coarsening occurs at much lower temperatures, as low as ambient temperatures for some metals. We discovered that nanometer-sized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s in pure copper and nickel produced from plastic deformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at low temperatures exhibit notable thermal stability below a critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size.

<i>Arabidopsis</i> pollen tube integrity and sperm release are regulated by RALF-mediated signaling
<p>In flowering plants, fertilizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> requires complex cell-to-cell communicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> events between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube and the female reproductive tissues, which are controlled by extracellular signaling molecules interacting with receptors at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube surface. We found that two such receptors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, BUPS1 and BUPS2, and their peptide ligands, RALF4 and RALF19, are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube–expressed and are required to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube inte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grit</span></strong>y. BUPS1 and BUPS2 interact with receptors ANXUR1 and ANXUR2 via their ectodomains, and both sets of receptors bind RALF4 and RALF19. These receptor-ligand interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are in competit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with the female-derived ligand RALF34, which induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube bursting at nanomolar concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. We propose that RALF34 replaces RALF4 and RALF19 at the interface of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube–female gametophyte contact, thereby deregulating BUPS-ANXUR signaling and in turn leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube rupture and sperm release.</p>

Selective increase in CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction activity at grain-boundary surface terminations

Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>-boundary density has previously been correlated with catalytic activity for some react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, direct evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries create surfaces with enhanced activity is lacking. We used a combinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of bulk electrochemical measurements and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with submicrometer resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>-boundary surface terminat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in gold electrodes are more active than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> surfaces for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to carbon monoxide (CO) but not for the competing hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

A long-standing challenge is thus to observe individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s, defects, and strain dynamics inside funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al materials. Here we report a technique capable of revealing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> heterogeneity, including strain fields and individual dislocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, that can be used under operando condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in reactive environments: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (gBCDI).

Mutational signatures associated with tobacco smoking in human cancer
<p>Tobacco smoking increases the risk of at least 17 classes of human cancer. We analyzed somatic mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and DNA methylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in 5243 cancers of types for which tobacco smoking confers an elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> burdens of multiple distinct mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al signatures, which contribute to different extents in different cancers. One of these signatures, mainly found in cancers derived from tissues directly exposed to tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>, is attributable to misreplicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens. Others likely reflect indirect activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of DNA editing by APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al process. Smoking is associated with limited differences in methylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The results are consistent with the proposit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that smoking increases cancer risk by increasing the somatic mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> load, although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in some smoking-related cancer types.</p>

Ubiquitin Specific Protease 15 Has an Important Role in Regulating Grain Width and Size in Rice
<p>Ubiquitinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and deubiquitinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are reversible processes that play crucial roles in regulating organ size in plants. However, informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> linking deubiquitinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and seed size in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is limited. Here, we characterized a dominant large-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> mutant, <i>large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>1-D</i> (<i>lg1-D</i>), with a 30.8% increase in seed width and a 34.5% increase in 1,000-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> weight relative to the wild type. The <i>lg1-D</i> mutant had more cells oriented in the lateral direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the spikelet hull compared with the wild type. Map-based cloning showed that <i>LG1</i> encodes a constitutively expressed ubiquitin-specific protease15 (OsUBP15) that possesses deubiquitinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> activity in vitro. Loss-of-funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and down-regulated express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>OsUBP15</i> produced narrower and smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s than the control. A set of in vivo experiments indicated that the mutant Osubp15 had enhanced protein stability relative to wild-type OsUBP15. Further experiments verified that OsDA1 directly interacted with OsUBP15. Genetic data indicated that <i>OsUBP15</i> and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> WIDTH 2</i> (<i>GW2</i>) were not independent in regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> width and size. In summary, we identified OsUBP15 as a positive regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> width and size in rice and provide a promising strategy for improvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield by pyramiding <i>OsUBP15</i> and <i>gw2</i>.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant systemic signaling pathways allow the integrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and coordinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two systemic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts systemically from shoots to positively regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the CRA2 systemic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REG<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e (SUNN) receptor systemic pathway negatively regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN systemic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e numbers.</p>

Bacterial Biosensors for in Vivo Spatiotemporal Mapping of Root Secretion
<p>Plants engineer the rhizosphere to their advantage by secreting various nutrients and secondary metabolites. Coupling transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) rhizosphere, a suite of bioreporters has been developed in <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> bv <i>viciae</i> strain 3841, and these detect metabolites secreted by roots in space and time. Fourteen bacterial <i>lux</i> fus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> bioreporters, specific for sugars, polyols, amino acids, organic acids, or flavonoids, have been validated in vitro and in vivo. Using different bacterial mutants (<i>nodC</i> and <i>nifH</i>), the process of colonizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and symbiosis has been analyzed, revealing compounds important in the different steps of the rhizobium-legume associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Dicarboxylates and sucrose are the main carbon sources within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es; in ineffective (<i>nifH</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particul</span></strong>arly low levels of sucrose were observed, suggesting that plant sanct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s affect carbon supply to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. In contrast, high <i>myo</i>-inositol levels were observed prior to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and also in <i>nifH</i> senescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. Amino acid biosensors showed different patterns: a γ-aminobutyrate biosensor was active only inside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, whereas the phenylalanine bioreporter showed a high signal also in the rhizosphere. The bioreporters were further validated in vetch (<i>Vicia hirsuta</i>), producing similar results. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, vetch exhibited a local increase of <i>nod</i> gene-inducing flavonoids at sites where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es developed subsequently. These bioreporters will be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particul</span></strong>arly helpful in understanding the dynamics of root exudat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and the role of different molecules secreted into the rhizosphere.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> requires the sophisticated interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degenerat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is delayed and degradat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development.</p>

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals

In this study, we discovered that plastic deformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> mechanism of extremely fine nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>ed metals and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundary (GB) stability. The electrodeposited nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>ed nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes.

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental quest<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase che<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mist</span></strong>ry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades.

3D Imaging of Tapetal Mitochondria Suggests the Importance of Mitochondrial Fission in Pollen Growth
<p>Mitochondrial fiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> occurs frequently in plant cells, but its biological significance is poorly understood because mutants specifically impaired in mitochondrial fiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> do not show obvious defects in vegetative growth. Here, we revealed that the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of viable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> was reduced in mutants lacking one of the three main proteins involved in mitochondrial fiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3A (DRP3A)/Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-LIKE PROTEIN2A, DRP3B, and ELONGATED MITOCHONDRIA1 (ELM1). In <i>drp3b</i> and <i>elm1</i>, young microspores contained an abnormal number of nuclei, and mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> had aberrant accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of lipids in their coat and an irregular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> outer wall. Because the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall and coat is mainly associated with tapetal funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, we used 3D imaging to quantify geometric and textural features of cells and mitochondria in the tapetum at different stages, using isolated single tapetal cells in which the in vivo morphology and volume of cells and mitochondria were preserved. Tapetal cells and their mitochondria changed in the volume and morphology at different developmental stages. Defective mitochondrial fiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the <i>elm1</i> and <i>drp3b</i> mutants caused changes in mitochondrial status, including mitochondrial elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure, a decrease in cross-sect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al area, and a slight alterat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of mitochondrial distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, as well as a large reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in mitochondrial density. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial fiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is required for proper mitochondrial status in the tapetum and possibly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> as well and therefore plays an important role for the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of viable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>.</p>

A MYB Triad Controls Primary and Phenylpropanoid Metabolites for Pollen Coat Patterning
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall is a complex, durable structure essential for plant reproduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. A substantial port<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of phenylpropanoids (e.g. flavonols) produced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> tapetal cells are deposited in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall. Transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> has been studied extensively, and a specific regulatory mechanism for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> flavonol biosynthesis has been postulated. Here, metabolome and transcriptome analyses of anthers from mutant and overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> genotypes revealed that Arabidopsis MYB99, a putative ortholog of the petunia (<i>Petunia hybrida</i>) floral scent regulator ODORANT1 (ODO1), controls the exclusive product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of tapetum diglycosylated flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid amides. We discovered that MYB99 acts in a regulatory triad with MYB21 and MYB24, orthologs of emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of benzenoids I and II, which together with ODO1 coregulate petunia scent biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, promoter-activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> assays showed that MYB99 directs precursor supply from the Calvin cycle and oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway in primary metabolism to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis by controlling <i>TRANSKETOLASE2</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We provide a model depicting the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between the Arabidopsis MYB triad and structural genes from primary and phenylpropanoid metabolism and compare this mechanism with petunia scent control. The discovery of orthologous protein triads producing related secondary metabolites suggests that analogous regulatory modules exist in other plants and act to regulate various branches of the intricate phenylpropanoid pathway.</p>

<i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> HtpG Interaction with nsLTP AsE246 Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation
<p>Plant nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are involved in a number of biological processes including root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e symbiosis. However, the role of nsLTPs in legume-rhizobium symbiosis remains poorly understood, and no rhizobia proteins that interact with nsLTPs have been reported to date. In this study, we used a bacteria two-hybrid system and identified the high temperature protein G (HtpG) from <i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> that interacts with the nsLTP AsE246. The interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between HtpG and AsE246 was confirmed by far-Western blotting and bimolecular fluorescence complementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Our results indicated that the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) domain of HtpG mediates the HtpG-AsE246 interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Immunofluorescence assay showed that HtpG was colocalized with AsE246 in infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e cells and symbiosome membranes. Express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <i>htpG</i> gene was relatively higher in young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es and was highly expressed in the infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> zones. Further investigat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> showed that <i>htpG</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> affects lipid abundance and profiles in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es and plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development and nitrogen fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Our findings provide further insights into the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al mechanisms behind the transport of symbiosome lipids via nsLTPs in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es.</p>

NIN Acts as a Network Hub Controlling a Growth Module Required for Rhizobial Infection
<p>The symbiotic infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of root cells by nitrogen-fixing rhizobia during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> requires the transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e Incept<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (NIN). Our root hair transcriptomic study extends NIN’s regulon to include <i>Rhizobium Polar Growth</i> and genes involved in cell wall modificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, gibberellin biosynthesis, and a comprehensive group of nutrient (N, P, and S) uptake and assimilat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> genes, suggesting that NIN’s recruitment to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was based on its role as a growth module, a role shared with other NIN-Like Proteins. The express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of jasmonic acid genes in <i>nin</i> suggests the involvement of NIN in the resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of growth versus defense outcomes. We find that the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the growth module component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Pectate Lyase by NIN, and its funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in rhizobial infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, are conserved in hologalegina legumes, highlighting its recruitment as a major event in the evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Pectate Lyase is secreted to the infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> chamber and the lumen of the infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> thread. Gene network analysis using the transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor mutants for <i>ERF Required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>1</i> and <i>Nuclear Factor-Y Subunit A1</i> confirms hierarchical control of NIN over <i>Nuclear Factor-Y Subunit A1</i> and shows that ERF Required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>1 acts independently to control infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We conclude that while NIN shares funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with other NIN-Like Proteins, the conscript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of key infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> genes to NIN’s control has made it a central regulatory hub for rhizobial infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al modificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e proteins: carbonylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, which occurs by direct oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of certain amino acids or by interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid peroxides; and glycat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, which results from the react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. Lipid peroxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> products induced most carbonylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> sites. This study also revealed that carbonylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> has major effects on two key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e proteins. Metal-catalyzed oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> caused the inactivat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of leghemoglobin. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e proteins: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> or glycat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e senescence.</p>

The MtDMI2-MtPUB2 Negative Feedback Loop Plays a Role in Nodulation Homeostasis
<p>DOES NOT MAKE INFECT<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> 2 (MtDMI2) is a Leu rich repeat-type receptor kinase required for signal transduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the <i>Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> symbiosis pathway. However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel plant U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of plants in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi plants) exhibited impaired infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> threads, fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control plants transformed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants were transformed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> activity, and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants transformed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative feedback loop of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative feedback loop, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> via MtNIN, plays an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis.</p>

Dynamics of Ethylene Production in Response to Compatible Nod Factor
<p>Establishment of symbiotic nitrogen-fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in legumes is regulated by the plant hormone ethylene, but it has remained unclear whether and how its biosynthesis is regulated by the symbiotic pathway. We established a sensitive ethylene detect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> system for <i>Lotus japonicus</i> and found that ethylene product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> increased as early as 6 hours after inoculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with <i>Mesorhizobium loti</i>. This ethylene response was dependent on Nod factor product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by compatible rhizobia. Analyses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> mutants showed that percept<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Nod factor was required for ethylene emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, while downstream transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factors including CYCLOPS, NIN, and ERN1 were not required for this response. Activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> signaling pathway in spontaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ating mutants was also sufficient to elevate ethylene product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Ethylene signaling is controlled by EIN2, which is duplicated in <i>L. japonicus</i>. We obtained a <i>L. japonicus Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant that exhibits complete ethylene insensitivity and confirms that these two genes act redundantly in ethylene signaling. Consistent with this redundancy, both <i>LjEin2a</i> and <i>LjEin2b</i> are required for negative regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutants are hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ating and hyperinfected. We also identified an unexpected role for ethylene in the onset of nitrogen fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, with the <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant showing severely reduced nitrogen fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. These results demonstrate that ethylene product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is an early and sustained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> response that acts at multiple stages to regulate infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e organogenesis, and nitrogen fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>L. japonicus</i>.</p>

DELLA1-Mediated Gibberellin Signaling Regulates Cytokinin-Dependent Symbiotic Nodulation
<p>In legume plants, low-nitrogen soils promote symbiotic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with rhizobial bacteria, leading to the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nitrogen-fixing root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. Among critical signals regulating this developmental process are bacterial Nod Factors (NFs) and several plant hormones, including cytokinins (CKs) and gibberellins (GAs). Here, we show in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> that GA signaling mediated by DELLA1 decreases the amount of bioactive CKs in roots and negatively impacts the Cytokinin Response1 (CRE1)-dependent NF activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a subset of CK-signaling genes as well as of the CK-regulated <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Signaling Pathway2</i> and <i>Ethylene Response Factor Required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>1</i> early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> genes. Consistently, a dominant-active DELLA1 protein can partially rescue the reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <i>cre1</i> mutant and triggers the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e-like structures when expressed in the root cortex or in the root epidermis. This suggests a model where the DELLA1-mediated GA signaling interplays with the CRE1-dependent CK pathway to regulate early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in response to both NF and CK signals critical for this symbiotic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

A 28-year clinical and radiological follow-up of alumina ceramic-on-crosslinked polyethylene total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim in this study was to describe a continuing review of   11 total hip arthroplasties using 22.225 mm Alumina ceramic femoral   heads on a Charnley flanged femoral component, articulating against   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silan</span></strong>e crosslinked polyethylene.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Nine patients (11 THAs) were reviewed at a mean of 27.5 years   (26 to 28) post-operatively. Outcome was assessed using the d’Aubigne   and Postel, and Charnley scores and penetration was recorded on   radiographs. In addition, the oxidation of a 29-year-old shelf-aged   acetabular component was analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean clinical outcome scores remained excellent at final   follow-up. The mean total penetration remained 0.41 mm (0.40 to   0.41). There was no radiographic evidence of acetabular or femoral   loosening or osteolysis. There was negligible oxidation in the shelf-aged   sample despite gamma irradiation and storage in air.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results highlight the long-term stability and durability   of this type of crosslinked, antioxidant containing polyethylene   when used in combination with a small diameter alumina ceramic femoral   head.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1286–9.</p></sec>

A surface gravity traverse on Mars indicates low bedrock density at Gale crater
<p>Gravimetry, the precise measurement of gravitational fields, can be used to probe the internal structure of Earth and other planets. The Curiosity rover on Mars carries accelerometers normally used for navigation and attitude determination. We have recalibrated them to isolate the signature of the changing gravitational acceleration as the rover climbs through Gale crater. The subsurface rock density is inferred from the measured decrease in gravitational field strength with elevation. The density of the sedimentary rocks in Gale crater is 1680 Â± 180 kilograms per cubic meter. This value is lower than expected, indicating a high porosity and constraining maximum burial depths of the rocks over their history.</p>

Mammals repel mosquitoes with their tails
<p><bold>Highlighted Article:</bold> Mammals swing their tails three times faster than a gravity-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pendulum</span></strong>. Our experiments with artificial tails show that tail motion generates winds sufficient to repel mosquitoes.</p>

Motion characteristics of human roller skating
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The motion characteristics of human roller skating are studied using the theory of mechanism design. The skating inverted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pendulum</span></strong> is used to describe roller skating with one supporting leg.</p>

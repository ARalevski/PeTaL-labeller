Long-term outcomes of cemented <i>versus</i> cementless humeral components in arthroplasty of the shoulder
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In the initial development of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA),   the humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was usually fixed with cement. Cementless   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were subsequently introduced. The aim of this study was   to compare the long-term outcome of cemented and cementless humeral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 cemented humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and   3469 cementless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. Patients with the two types of fixation   were matched for nine different covariates using a propensity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with cemented   and cementless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent determined at revision surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-operative infection and operating time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of survival were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively. Survival without loosening   at 20 years was 98% for cemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and 92.4% for cementless   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. After propensity score matching including fixation as   determined by the design of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent, humeral loosening was   also found to be significantly higher in the cementless group. Survival   without humeral loosening at 20 years was 98.7% for cemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents   and 91.0% for cementless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. There was no significant difference   in the risk of intra- or post-operative fracture. The rate of survival   without deep infection and the mean operating time were significantly   higher in the cemented group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both types of fixation give rates of long-term survival of >   90%. Cemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents have better rates of survival without loosening   but this should be weighed against increased operating time and   the risk of bony destruction of the proximal humerus at the time   of revision of a cemented humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:666–73.</p></sec>

Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Hydroxyapatite coatings have been   applied to improve bone ingrowth in uncemented designs, but may   only coat the directly accessible surface. As peri-apatite (PA)   is solution deposited, this may increase the coverage of the implant   surface and thereby fixation. We assessed the tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent fixation   of uncemented PA-coated TKAs <i>versus</i> cemented TKAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to PA-coated or cemented TKAs. In 60   patients (30 in each group), radiostereometric analysis of tibial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent migration was evaluated as the primary outcome at baseline,   three months post-operatively and at one, two and five years. A   linear mixed-effects model was used to analyse the repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After five years of follow-up, one (cemented) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was revised   due to ligament instability. Overall, uncemented PA-coated tibial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents migrated significantly more    (p = 0.003), with the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) at   five years being 0.62 mm (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to   0.76) for cemented tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and 0.97 mm (95% CI 0.81 to   1.15) for PA-coated tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents in TKA. However, between three   months and five years the cemented TKAs migrated significantly more   (p = 0.02), displaying a MTPM of 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.36) <i>versus</i> 0.13   mm (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.25) for PA-coated tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. One implant   in each group was considered at risk for aseptic loosening due to continuous   migration after five years of follow-up, albeit with different migration   patterns for each group (i.e. higher initial migration but diminishing   over time for the PA-coated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent <i>versus</i> gradually   increasing migration for the cemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of PA-coated TKAs showed more overall migration   compared with the tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of cemented TKAs. However, <i>post   hoc</i> analysis showed that this difference was caused by   higher migration of PA-coated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents in the first three months,   after which a stable migration pattern was observed.

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ions), to efficiently identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion sites out of 41 sites (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion site. We suggest that strains obtained by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-genome sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

Proximal translation of > 1 mm within the first two years of revision total hip arthroplasty correctly predicts whether or not an acetabular component is loose in 80% of cases
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity   and predictive values of previously reported thresholds of proximal   translation and sagittal rotation of cementless acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents   used for revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) at various times   during early follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Migration of cementless acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents was measured retrospectively   in 84 patients (94 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents) using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup)   in two groups of patients. In Group A, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were recorded   as not being loose intra-operatively at re-revision THA (52 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents/48   patients) and Group B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were recorded to be loose at re-revision   (42 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents/36 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean proximal translation and sagittal rotation were significantly   higher in Group B than in Group A from three months onwards (p <   0.02).

The evolution of an uncemented acetabular component in alumina-on-alumina total hip arthroplasty has improved clinical outcome
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine the effect of a change in design of a cementless   ceramic acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent in fixation and clinical outcome after   total hip arthroplasty</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We compared 342 hips (302 patients) operated between 1999 and   2005 with a relatively smooth hydroxyapatite coated acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent   (group 1), and 337 hips (310 patients) operated between 2006 and   2011 using a similar acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent with a macrotexture on   the entire outer surface of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent (group 2). The mean age of   the patients was 53.5 (14 to 70) in group 1 and 53.0 (15 to 70)   in group 2. The mean follow-up was 12.7 years (10 to 17) for group   1 and 7.2 years (4 to 10) for group 2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No hips were revised due to complications related to bearing   fracture or to stem loosening. A total of 15 acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents   were revised for aseptic loosening in group 1 and two in group 2.

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents (100%) were loose. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was a score of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring system and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent.

Retrotransposon Insertion and DNA Methylation Regulate Aluminum Tolerance in European Barley Accessions
<p>Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major stress factor limiting crop productivity in acid soil. Although there is great genotypic variation in tolerance to Al toxicity, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report that, in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the fourth largest cereal crop produced in the world, both retrotransposon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion and DNA methylation are involved in regulating differential Al tolerance. <i>HvAACT1</i> is a major gene responsible for citrate secretion from the roots for external detoxification of Al. A multiretrotransposon-like (MRL) sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion at least 15.3 kb in length was detected in the upstream genomic region of <i>HvAACT1</i> that displayed promoter activity and significantly enhanced <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, especially in the root tips of Al-tolerant accessions. Furthermore, in a number of accessions with low levels of <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, this MRL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion was present but highly methylated. Geographical analysis showed that accessions with this MRL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion are distributed mainly in European areas with acid soils. Two wild barley accessions were found to possess this MRL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion, but with a high degree of methylation. These results indicate that the MRL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion and its degree of DNA methylation influence <i>HvAACT1</i> expression and that demethylation of this MRL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion, which facilitates adaptation to acid soils, occurred following barley domestication. Moreover, our results indicate that barley accessions in East Asia and Europe have developed independent but equivalent strategies to withstand Al toxicity in acid soils.</p>

An Improved <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS
<p>Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extens</span></strong>ively for gene function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with silencing conducted through stable transformation, but many virus-silencing vectors, especially in grasses, induce only transient silencing phenotypes. A major reason for transient phenotypes is the instability of the foreign gene fragment (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the development of a <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> (BMV)-based vector that better maintains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>s through modification of the original BMV vector RNA sequence. Modification of the BMV RNA3 sequence yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained <i>phytoene desaturase</i> and <i>heat shock protein70-1</i> (<i>HSP70-1</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>s in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Longer maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>s was correlated with greater target gene silencing and more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extens</span></strong>ive visible silencing phenotypes displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more leaves. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in <i>N. benthamiana</i> after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of virus in this intermediate host used to produce virus inoculum for grass hosts. For <i>HSP70</i>, silencing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target gene knockdown and not a general effect of virus infection. The cause of the increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong> stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in grasses, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.</p>

Promising early results for trabecular metal acetabular components used at revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of aseptic   loosening after the use of a cemented acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent and a   Trabecular Metal (TM) acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent (Zimmer Inc., Warsaw,   Indiana) at acetabular revision with bone impaction grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 42 patients were included in the study.

Contemporary failure aetiologies of the primary, posterior-stabilised total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of revision total knee arthroplasties (TKA) that are   performed is expected to increase. However, previous reports of   the causes of failure after TKA are limited in that they report   the causes at specific institutions, which are often dependent on   referral patterns. Our aim was to report the most common indications   for re-operations and revisions in a large series of posterior-stabilised   TKAs undertaken at a single institution, excluding referrals from   elsewhere, which may bias the causes of failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 5098 TKAs which were undertaken between 2000 and 2012   were included in the study. Re-operations, revisions with modular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent exchange, and revisions with non-modular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent replacement   or removal were identified from the medical records. The mean follow-up   was five years (two to 12).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Kaplan-Meier ten-year survival without a re-operation, modular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent revision and non-modular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent revision was 95.7%,   99.3% and 95.3%, respectively. The most common indications for a   re-operation were: post-operative stiffness (58%), delayed wound healing   (21%), and patellar clunk (11%). The indications for isolated modular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent revision were acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   (64%) and instability (36%). The most common indications for non-modular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent revision were chronic PJI (52%), aseptic loosening (17%), periprosthetic   fracture (10%), and instability (10%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Post-operative stiffness remains the most common indication for   re-operation after TKA. Infection is the most common indication   for modular and non-modular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent revision. Aseptic loosening   was not an uncommon cause of failure, however, it was much less   common than in national registry and non-registry data.

Custom-made total ankle arthroplasty for the salvage of major talar bone loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A failed total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is often associated with   much bone loss. As an alternative to arthrodesis, the surgeon may   consider a custom-made talar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent to compensate for the bone   loss. Our aim in this study was to assess the functional and radiological   outcome after the use of such a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent at mid- to long-term follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 12 patients (five women and seven men, mean age 53   years; 36 to77) with a failed TAA and a large talar defect underwent   a revision procedure using a custom-made talar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent. The design   of the custom-made <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents was based on CT scans and standard   radiographs, when compared with the contralateral ankle. After the   anterior talocalcaneal joint was fused, the talar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was   introduced and fixed to the body of the calcaneum.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 6.9 years (1 to 13), 11 ankles were stable   with no radiological evidence of loosening. Only one was lost to   follow-up. The mean arc of movement was 21<sup>°</sup> (10<sup>°</sup> to   35<sup>°</sup>). A total of nine patients (75%) were satisfied or   very satisfied with the outcome, two (17%) were satisfied but with   reservations and one (8%) was not satisfied.

Measuring the migration of the components and polyethylene wear after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This paper describes the methodology, validation and reliability   of a new computer-assisted method which uses models of the patient’s   bones and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents to measure their migration and polyethylene   wear from radiographs after total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Models of the patient’s acetabular and femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent obtained   from the manufacturer and models of the patient’s pelvis and femur   built from a single computed tomography (CT) scan, are used by a   computer program to measure the migration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and   the penetration of the femoral head from anteroposterior and lateral radiographs   taken at follow-up visits.

The ER membrane protein complex is a transmembrane domain insertase
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of proteins into membranes is an essential cellular process. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extens</span></strong>ive biophysical and topological diversity of membrane proteins necessitates multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion pathways that remain incompletely defined. Here we found that known membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion pathways fail to effectively engage tail-anchored membrane proteins with moderately hydrophobic transmembrane domains. These proteins are instead shielded in the cytosol by calmodulin. Dynamic release from calmodulin allowed sampling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the conserved ER membrane protein complex (EMC) was shown to be essential for efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion in vitro and in cells. Purified EMC in synthetic liposomes catalyzed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of its substrates in a reconstituted system. Thus, EMC is a transmembrane domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ase, a function that may explain its widely pleiotropic membrane-associated phenotypes across organisms.</p>

The GET System Inserts the Tail-Anchored Protein, SYP72, into Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome encodes homologs of the Guided Entry of Tail (GET)-anchored protein system for the posttranslational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of tail-anchored (TA) proteins into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. In yeast, TA proteins are loaded onto the cytosolic targeting factor Get3 and are then delivered to the membrane-associated Get1/2 complex for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion into ER membranes. The role of the GET system in Arabidopsis was investigated by monitoring the membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of a tail-anchored protein, SYP72, a syntaxin. SYP72 bound to yeast Get3 in vitro, forming a Get3-SYP72 fusion complex that could be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ed into yeast GET1/2-containing proteoliposomes. The Arabidopsis GET system functioned in vivo to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong> TA proteins into ER membranes as demonstrated by the fact that the YFP-tagged SYP72 localized to the ER in wild-type plants but accumulated as cytoplasmic inclusions in <i>get1</i>, <i>get3</i>, or <i>get4</i> mutants. The GET mutants <i>get1</i> and <i>get3</i> were less tolerant of ER stress agents and showed symptoms of ER stress even under unstressed conditions. Hence, the GET system is responsible for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of TA proteins into the ER in Arabidopsis, and mutants with GET dysfunctions are more susceptible to ER stress.</p>

Retrotransposon-Mediated Aluminum Tolerance through Enhanced Expression of the Citrate Transporter OsFRDL4
<p>High aluminum (Al) tolerance of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is controlled by multiple tolerance genes, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differential expression of these genes are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the factors regulating the expression of <i>OsFRDL4</i>, a gene encoding a citrate efflux transporter involved in Al-induced citrate secretion from the roots. Analysis with chromosome segment substitution lines derived from cv Nipponbare (high <i>OsFRDL4</i> expression) and cv Kasalath (low <i>OsFRDL4</i> expression) revealed that the differential expression of <i>OsFRDL4</i> is responsible for the quantitative trait locus for Al tolerance detected previously on chromosome 1. Comparison of the <i>OsFRDL4</i> gene structure in cv Nipponbare and cv Kasalath showed that there was no difference in the position of the transcriptional start site, but a 1.2-kb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion showing high similarity to the solo long terminal repeat of the retrotransposon was found in the promoter region of <i>OsFRDL4</i> in cv Nipponbare. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion showed higher promoter activity and contained nine cis-acting elements for ALUMINUM RESISTANCE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (ART1). However, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion did not alter the spatial expression or cellular localization of OsFRDL4. Furthermore, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion was found in most <i>japonica</i> varieties but was largely absent from <i>indica</i> varieties or wild rice species. These results indicate that the 1.2-kb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion in the <i>OsFRDL4</i> promoter region in <i>japonica</i> subspecies is responsible for their higher expression level of <i>OsFRDL4</i> due to the increased number of cis-acting elements of ART1. Our results also suggest that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion event happened at the initial stage of domestication of <i>japonica</i> subspecies.</p>

OsbZIP48, a HY5 Transcription Factor Ortholog, Exerts Pleiotropic Effects in Light-Regulated Development
<p>Plants have evolved an intricate network of sensory photoreceptors and signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents to regulate their development. Among the light signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents identified to date, HY5, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, has been investigated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extens</span></strong>ively. However, most of the work on HY5 has been carried out in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), a dicot. In this study, based on homology search and phylogenetic analysis, we identified three homologs of AtHY5 in monocots; however, AtHYH (HY5 homolog) homologs are absent in the monocots analyzed. Out of the three homologs identified in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), we have functionally characterized <i>OsbZIP48</i>. <i>OsbZIP48</i> was able to complement the <i>Athy5</i> mutant. OsbZIP48 protein levels are developmentally regulated in rice. Moreover, the OsbZIP48 protein does not degrade in dark-grown rice and <i>Athy5</i> seedlings complemented with <i>OsbZIP48</i>, which is in striking contrast to AtHY5. In comparison with <i>AtHY5</i>, which does not cause any change in hypocotyl length when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, the overexpression of full-length <i>OsbZIP48</i> in rice transgenics reduced the plant height considerably. Microarray analysis revealed that <i>OsKO2</i>, which encodes <i>ent</i>-kaurene oxidase 2 of the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway, is down-regulated in <i>OsbZIP48<sup>OE</sup></i> and up-regulated in <i>OsbZIP48<sup>KD</sup></i> transgenics as compared with the wild type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsbZIP48 binds directly to the <i>OsKO2</i> promoter. The RNA interference lines and the T-DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ional mutant of <i>OsbZIP48</i> showed seedling-lethal phenotypes despite the fact that roots were more proliferative during early stages of development in the T-DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ional mutant. These data provide credible evidence that OsbZIP48 performs more diverse functions in a monocot system like rice in comparison with its Arabidopsis ortholog, HY5.</p>

Fitness Trade-Offs Lead to Suppressor Tolerance in Yeast
<p>Genetic variation among individuals within a population provides the raw material for phenotypic diversity upon which natural selection operates. Some given variants can act on multiple standing genomic variations simultaneously and release previously inaccessible phenotypes, leading to increased adaptive potential upon challenging environments. Previously, we identified such a variant related to a tRNA nonsense suppressor in yeast. When introduced into other genetic backgrounds, the suppressor led to an increased population phenotypic variance on various culture conditions, conferring background and environment specific selective advantages. Nonetheless, most isolates are intolerant to the suppressor on rich media due to a severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness cost. Here, we found that the tolerance to suppressor is related to a surprising level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness outburst, showing a trade-off effect to accommodate the cost of carrying the suppressor. To dissect the genetic basis of such trade-offs, we crossed strains with contrasting tolerance levels on rich media, and analyzed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness distribution patterns in the offspring. Combining quantitative tetrad analysis and bulk segregant analysis, we identified two genes, namely <i>MKT1</i> and <i>RGA1</i>, involved in suppressor tolerance. We showed that alleles from the tolerant parent for both genes conferred a significant gain of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness, which increased the suppressor tolerance. Our results present a detailed dissection of suppressor tolerance in yeast and provide insights into the molecular basis of trade-offs between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness and evolutionary potential.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Strong Epistatic Interactions within a Single Protein
<p>A central question in protein molecular evolution is whether an amino acid that occurs at a given site makes an independent contribution to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness or whether its contribution depends on other amino acid sites in the protein sequence, a phenomenon known as intragenic epistasis. In the absence of intragenic epistasis, natural selection acts on a protein mutation independent of its genetic background, and the experimentally determined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness for a mutation should be the same across all genetic backgrounds. We tested this hypothesis by using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a well-characterized deleterious single amino acid substitution in 56 different hepatitis C virus NS3 protease variants. The catalytic efficiency of the mutated proteases was determined and compared with the corresponding wild-type protein. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness effects ranged from lethality to significantly beneficial. Although primarily deleterious and lethal effects were observed (41 and 5 out of 56 tested variants, respectively), deleterious effects ranged from near neutral (−26.7% reduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness) to near lethal (−98.5%). Our findings demonstrate that the introduced amino acid substitution has different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness effects in different protein variants and provide independent support for the relevant role of intragenic epistasis in protein evolution.</p>

Kudo type-5 total elbow arthroplasty for patients with rheumatoid arthritis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We assessed the long-term (more than ten-year) outcomes of the   Kudo type-5 elbow prosthesis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis   (RA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 41 elbows (Larsen Grade IV, n = 21; Grade V, n =   20) in 31 patients with RA who had undergone a Kudo type-5 total   elbow arthroplasty (TEA) between 1994 and 2003, and had been followed   up for more than ten years. The humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was cementless   and the all-polyethylene ulnar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent cemented in every patient.

Risk of early mortality after cemented compared with cementless total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It has been suggested that cemented fixation of total hip arthroplasty   (THA) is associated with an increased peri-operative mortality compared   with cementless THA. Our aim was to investigate this through a nationwide   matched cohort study adjusting for age, comorbidity, and socioeconomic   background.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 178 784 patients with osteoarthritis who underwent   either cemented or cementless THA from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty   Register were matched with 862 294 controls from the general population.   Information about the causes of death, comorbidities, and socioeconomic   background was obtained. Mortality within the first 90 days after   the operation was the primary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients who underwent cemented THA had an increased risk of   death during the first 14 days compared with the controls (hazard   ratio (HR) 1.3, confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 1.44), corresponding   to an absolute increase in risk of five deaths per 10 000 observations.   No such early increase of risk was seen in those who underwent cementless THA.   Between days 15 and 29 the risk of mortality was decreased for those   with cemented THA (HR 0.7, CI 0.62 to 0.87). Between days 30 and   90 all patients undergoing THA, irrespective of the mode of fixation,   had a lower risk of death than controls. Patients selected for cementless   fixation were younger, healthier and had a higher level of education   and income than those selected for cemented THA. A supplementary   analysis of 16 556 hybrid THAs indicated that cementation of the   femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was associated with a slight increase in mortality   up to 15 days, whereas no such increase in mortality was seen in   those with a cemented acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent combined with a cementless   femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This nationwide matched cohort study indicates that patients   receiving cemented THA have a minimally increased relative risk   of early mortality that is reversed from day 15 and thereafter.

Dynamic pre-BCR homodimers fine-tune autonomous survival signals in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia
<p>The pre–B cell receptor (pre-BCR) is an immature form of the BCR critical for early B lymphocyte development. It is composed of the membrane-bound immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain, surrogate light chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents, and the signaling subunits Igα and Igβ. We developed monovalent quantum dot (QD)–labeled probes specific for Igβ to study the behavior of pre-BCRs engaged in autonomous, ligand-independent signaling in live B cells. Single-particle tracking revealed that QD-labeled pre-BCRs engaged in transient, but frequent, homotypic interactions. Receptor motion was correlated at short separation distances, consistent with the formation of dimers and higher-order oligomers. Repeated encounters between diffusing pre-BCRs appeared to reflect transient co-confinement in plasma membrane domains. In human B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells, we showed that frequent, short-lived, homotypic pre-BCR interactions stimulated survival signals, including expression of <i>BCL6</i>, which encodes a transcriptional repressor. These survival signals were blocked by inhibitory monovalent antigen-binding antibody fragments (Fabs) specific for the surrogate light chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of the pre-BCR or by inhibitors of the tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. For comparison, we evaluated pre-BCR aggregation mediated by dimeric galectin-1, which has binding sites for carbohydrate and for the surrogate light chain λ5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent. Galectin-1 binding resulted in the formation of large, highly immobile pre-BCR aggregates, which was partially relieved by the addition of lactose to prevent the cross-linking of galectin-BCR complexes to other glycosylated membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. Analysis of the pre-BCR and its signaling partners suggested that they could be potential targets for combination therapy in BCP-ALL.</p>

Distinct control of PERIOD2 degradation and circadian rhythms by the oncoprotein and ubiquitin ligase MDM2
<p>The circadian clock relies on posttranslational modifications to set the timing for degradation of core regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents, which drives clock progression. Ubiquitin-modifying enzymes that target clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents for degradation mainly recognize phosphorylated substrates. Degradation of the circadian clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent PERIOD 2 (PER2) is mediated by its phospho-specific recognition by β-transducin repeat–containing proteins (β-TrCPs), which are F-box–containing proteins that function as substrate recognition subunits of the SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex. However, this mode of regulating PER2 stability falls short of explaining the persistent oscillatory phenotypes reported in biological systems lacking functional elements of the phospho-dependent PER2 degradation machinery. We identified PER2 as a previously uncharacterized substrate for the ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and found that MDM2 targeted PER2 for degradation in a manner independent of PER2 phosphorylation. Deregulation of MDM2 plays a major role in oncogenesis by contributing to the accumulation of genomic and epigenomic alterations that favor tumor development. MDM2-mediated PER2 turnover was important for defining the circadian period length in mammalian cells, a finding that emphasizes the connection between the circadian clock and cancer. Our results not only broaden the range of specific substrates of MDM2 beyond the cell cycle to include circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents but also identify a previously unknown regulator of the clock as a druggable node that is often found to be deregulated during tumorigenesis.</p>

Structure of the DASH/Dam1 complex shows its role at the yeast kinetochore-microtubule interface
<p>Kinetochores connect mitotic-spindle microtubules with chromosomes, allowing microtubule depolymerization to pull chromosomes apart during anaphase while resisting detachment as the microtubule shortens. The heterodecameric DASH/Dam1 complex (DASH/Dam1c), an essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent of yeast kinetochores, assembles into a microtubule-encircling ring. The ring associates with rodlike Ndc80 complexes to organize the kinetochore-microtubule interface. We report the cryo–electron microscopy structure (at ~4.5-angstrom resolution) of a DASH/Dam1c ring and a molecular model of its ordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents, validated by evolutionary direct-coupling analysis. Integrating this structure with that of the Ndc80 complex and with published interaction data yields a molecular picture of kinetochore-microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attach</span></strong>ment, including how flexible, C-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extens</span></strong>ions of DASH/Dam1c subunits project and contact widely separated sites on the Ndc80 complex rod and how phosphorylation at previously identified sites might regulate kinetochore assembly.</p>

Membrane protein insertion through a mitochondrial β-barrel gate
<p>The biogenesis of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and Gram-negative bacteria requires the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of β-barrel proteins into the outer membranes. Homologous Omp85 proteins are essential for membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of β-barrel precursors. It is unknown if precursors are threaded through the Omp85-channel interior and exit laterally or if they are translocated into the membrane at the Omp85-lipid interface. We have mapped the interaction of a precursor in transit with the mitochondrial Omp85-channel Sam50 in the native membrane environment. The precursor is translocated into the channel interior, interacts with an internal loop, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>s into the lateral gate by β-signal exchange. Transport through the Omp85-channel interior followed by release through the lateral gate into the lipid phase may represent a basic mechanism for membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of β-barrel proteins.</p>

Early spectra of the gravitational wave source GW170817: Evolution of a neutron star merger
<p>On 17 August 2017, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) was discovered as the optical counterpart of the binary neutron star gravitational wave event GW170817. We report time-series spectroscopy of SSS17a from 11.75 hours until 8.5 days after the merger. Over the first hour of observations, the ejecta rapidly expanded and cooled. Applying blackbody <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>s to the spectra, we measured the photosphere cooling from [Formula] to [Formula] kelvin, and determined a photospheric velocity of roughly 30% of the speed of light. The spectra of SSS17a began displaying broad features after 1.46 days and evolved qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. The late-time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent is consistent with theoretical models of r-process–enriched neutron star ejecta, whereas the blue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent requires high-velocity, lanthanide-free material.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Family of NAI2-Interacting Proteins in the Biogenesis of the ER Body and Related Structures
<p>Plants produce different types of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles that accumulate and transport proteins, lipids, and metabolites. In the Brassicales, a distinct ER-derived structure called the ER body is found throughout the epidermis of cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. NAI2 is a key factor for ER body formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Homologs of NAI2 are found only in the Brassicales and therefore may have evolved specifically to enable ER body formation. Here, we report that three related Arabidopsis NAI2-interacting proteins (NAIP1, NAIP2, and NAIP3) play a critical role in the biogenesis of ER bodies and related structures. Analysis using GFP fusions revealed that all three NAIPs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of the ER bodies found in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. Genetic analysis with <i>naip</i> mutants indicates that they have a critical and redundant role in ER body formation. NAIP2 and NAIP3 are also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of other vesicular structures likely derived from the ER that are formed independent of NAI2 and are present not only in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots, but also in the rosettes. Thus, while NAIP1 is a specialized ER body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent, NAIP2 and NAIP3 are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of different types of ER-derived structures. Analysis of chimeric NAIP proteins revealed that their N-terminal domains play a major role in the functional specialization between NAIP1 and NAIP3. Unlike NAI2, NAIPs have homologs in all plants; therefore, NAIP-containing ER structures, from which the ER bodies in the Brassicales may have evolved, are likely to be present widely in plants.</p>

Heteroblastic Development of Transfer Cells Is Controlled by the microRNA miR156/SPL Module
<p>We report that wall ingrowth deposition in phloem parenchyma (PP) transfer cells (TCs) in leaf veins of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) represents a novel trait of heteroblasty. Development of PP TCs involves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extens</span></strong>ive deposition of wall ingrowths adjacent to cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. These PP TCs potentially facilitate phloem loading by enhancing efflux of symplasmic Suc for subsequent active uptake into cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. PP TCs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extens</span></strong>ive wall ingrowths are ubiquitous in mature cotyledons and juvenile leaves, but dramatically less so in mature adult leaves, an observation consistent with PP TC development reflecting vegetative phase change (VPC) in Arabidopsis. Consistent with this conclusion, the abundance of PP TCs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extens</span></strong>ive wall ingrowths varied across rosette development in three ecotypes displaying differing durations of juvenile phase, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extens</span></strong>ive deposition of wall ingrowths was observed in rejuvenated leaves following prolonged defoliation. PP TC development across juvenile, transition, and adult leaves correlated positively with levels of miR156, a major regulator of VPC in plants, and corresponding changes in wall ingrowth deposition were observed when miR156 was overexpressed or its activity suppressed by target mimicry. Analysis of plants carrying miR156-resistant forms of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> (<i>SPL</i>) genes showed that wall ingrowth deposition was increased in <i>SPL9</i>-group but not <i>SPL3</i>-group genes, indicating that <i>SPL9</i>-group genes may function as negative regulators of wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs. Collectively, our results point to wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs being under control of the genetic program regulating VPC.</p>

Phosphorylation of GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 Alters Stimulation of Mg Chelatase Activity in Angiosperms
<p>GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 (GUN4) is a positive regulator of light-dependent chlorophyll biosynthesis. GUN4 activates Mg chelatase (MgCh) that catalyzes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of an Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion into protoporphyrin IX. We show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GUN4 is phosphorylated at Ser 264 (S264), the penultimate amino acid residue at the C terminus. While GUN4 is preferentially phosphorylated in darkness, phosphorylation is reduced upon accumulation of Mg porphyrins. Expression of a phosphomimicking <i>GUN4</i>(S264D) results in an incomplete complementation of the white <i>gun4-2 null</i> mutant and a chlorotic phenotype comparable to <i>gun4</i> knockdown mutants. Phosphorylated GUN4 has a reduced stimulatory effect on MgCh in vitro and in vivo but retains its protein stability and tetrapyrrole binding capacity. Analysis of GUN4 found in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms reveals the evolution of a C-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extens</span></strong>ion, which harbors the phosphorylation site of GUN4 expressed in angiosperms. Homologs of GUN4 from <i>Synechocystis</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas</i> lack the conserved phosphorylation site found in a C-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extens</span></strong>ion of angiosperm GUN4. Biochemical studies proved the importance of the C-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extens</span></strong>ion for MgCh stimulation and inactivation of GUN4 by phosphorylation in angiosperms. An additional mechanism regulating MgCh activity is proposed. In conjunction with the dark repression of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis, GUN4 phosphorylation minimizes the flow of intermediates into the Mg branch of the tetrapyrrole metabolic pathway for chlorophyll biosynthesis.</p>

High Fitness Costs and Instability of Gene Duplications Reduce Rates of Evolution of New Genes by Duplication-Divergence Mechanisms
<p>An important mechanism for generation of new genes is by duplication-divergence of existing genes. Duplication-divergence includes several different submodels, such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of neutral mutations the original function is distributed between two partially functional and complementary genes, and neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness cost and genetic stability of the duplications. Here, we determined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness cost and stability of defined gene duplications/amplifications on a low copy number plasmid. Our experimental results show that the costs of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each additional kilo base pairs of DNA reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene amplifications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness costs and instability strongly reduces the likelihood of both sub- and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial functions.</p>

The validity and reproducibility of cross table radiographs compared with CT scans for the measurement of anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and validity   of cross table radiographs for measuring the anteversion of the   acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to compare   it with measurements using CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 29 patients who underwent THA between June 2010 and   January 2016 were included. There were 17 men and 12 women. Their   mean age was 43 years (26 to 65). Seven patients underwent a bilateral   procedure. Thus, 36 THAs were included in the study. Lateral radiographs   and CT scans were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later. The anteversion of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was   measured using the method described by Woo and Morrey and the ischiolateral   method described by Pulos et al and these were compared with the   results obtained from CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean anteversion was 18.35° (3° to 38°) using Woo and Morrey’s   method, 51.45° (30° to 85°) using the ischiolateral method and 21.22°   (2° to 48°) using CT scans. The Pearson correlation coefficient   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method. There was a linear correlation between the measurements   using the ischiolateral method and those using CT scans. We derived   a simple linear equation between the value of the CT scan and that   of ischiolateral method to deduce the CT scan value from that of ischiolateral   method and <i>vice versa</i>. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anteversion of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent measured using both   plain radiographic methods was consistently valid with good interobserver   reproducibility, but the ischiolateral method which is independent   of pelvic tilt was more accurate. As CT is costly, associated with   a high dose of radiation and not readily available, the ischiolateral method   can be used for assessing the anteversion of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1006–11.</p></sec>

Local bisphosphonate reduces migration and formation of radiolucent lines adjacent to cemented acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Post-operative migration of cemented acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents as   measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) has a strong predictive   power for late, aseptic loosening. Also, radiolucent lines predict   late loosening. Migration has been reduced by systemic bisphosphonate   treatment in randomised trials of hip and knee arthroplasty. Used   as a local treatment, a higher local dose of bisphosphonate can   be achieved without systemic exposure. We wished to see if this   principle could be applied usefully in total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this randomised placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial with   60 participants, we compressed gauze soaked in bisphosphonate solution   (ibandronate) or saline against the acetabular bone bed immediately   before cementing the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent. RSA, classification of   radiolucent lines, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and the Western Ontario McMasters   Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were carried out at three-,   six-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Migration of the cemented acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent relative to the   pelvis was reduced by movement almost half in the ibandronate group,   when measured as maximum total point or as movement of the femoral   head (p = 0.001 and 0.004, respectively). Radiolucent lines after   one year were classified as absent, partial or complete, and correlated with   treatment (rho 0.37; p = 0.004). Only three of 30 patients in the   ibandronate group had complete lines, compared with 13 of 28 in   the placebo group (p = 0.002).

Left Ventricular Assist Device Malfunctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reports of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) malfunction have focused on pump thrombosis. However, the device consists of the pump, driveline, and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Prospectively collected data were reviewed for all LVAD device malfunctions (DMs) occurring in rotary LVADs implanted at a single center between April 2004 and May 2016. Durable LVADs included 108 Heartmate II (HM II) and 105 HeartWare VAD (HVAD). DM data were categorized according to device type and into categories related to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent that failed: (1) controller, (2) peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents, and (3) implantable blood pump or its integral electric driveline. Pump-related events were analyzed as pump-specific (suspected or confirmed thrombosis) or nonpump-specific (driveline failure). DM rates were reported as events per 1000 patient-days, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses. Cumulative rates of malfunction were examined for the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of each type of LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Types of DM included controller failure (30%), battery failure (19%), or patient cable failure (14%), whereas only 13% were because of pump failure. DMs were more common in the HM II device (3.73 per 1000 patient-days versus 3.06 per 1000 patient-days for the HVAD, <i>P</i><0.01). A higher rate of pump-specific malfunctions was discovered in those implanted with an HM II versus an HVAD (0.55 versus 0.39, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01) and peripheral malfunctions (2.32 versus 1.78 for the HM II and HVAD, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01); no difference occurred in the incidence of controller DM between the 2 LVADs. Patients with HVAD were 90% free of a pump-specific malfunction at 3 years compared with 56% for the HM II (log-rank <i>P</i><0.003). Only 74% of the patients with HM II were free of pump thrombosis at 3 years compared with 90% of the patients with HVAD.

TATA Box Insertion Provides a Selection Mechanism Underpinning Adaptations to Fe Deficiency
<p>Intraspecific genetic variation is essential for the responses and adaption of plants to evolutionary challenges, such as changing environmental conditions. The development of the Earth’s aerobic atmosphere has increased the demand for iron (Fe) in organisms, and Fe deficiency has become a limiting environmental factor for plant growth. Here, we demonstrate that genus <i>Malus</i> adapt to Fe deficiency through modification of the <i>Iron-Regulated Transporter1</i> (<i>IRT1</i>) promoter. Specifically, an <i>IRT1</i> mutant allele with a TATA-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion in the promoter region upstream of the coding region exhibited increased <i>IRT1</i> expression. The altered <i>IRT1</i> promoter is responsible for enhancing Fe uptake. Increasing the number of synthetic repeat TATA-boxes correlates with increased promoter activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of the TATA-box correlates with an increase in transcriptional activation via specific binding of the transcription factor IID (MDP0000939369). Taken together, these results indicate that an allelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of a TATA-box in a gene promoter has allowed apple to adapt to the selective pressure posed by Fe deficiency. More broadly, this study reveals a new mechanism for enhancing gene expression to help plants adapt to different environments, providing new insights into molecular genetic divergence in plants.</p>

Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–selection models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p>Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation’s effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness effects (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent bene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>s of the genetic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extens</span></strong>ive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational effects on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

Source of CpG Depletion in the HIV-1 Genome
<p>The dinucleotide CpG is highly underrepresented in the genome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). To identify the source of CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion in the HIV-1 genome, we investigated two biological mechanisms: (1) CpG methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and (2) CpG recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We hypothesized that HIV-1 has been under selective evolutionary pressure by these mechanisms leading to the reduction of CpG in its genome. A CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ed genome would enable HIV-1 to avoid methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and/or to avoid recognition by TLRs that identify foreign CpG sequences. We investigated these two hypotheses by determining the sequence context dependency of CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion and comparing it with that of CpG methylation and TLR recognition. We found that in both human and HIV-1 genomes the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ed most and those flanked by C/G were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ed least. Similarly, our analyses of human methylome data revealed that the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were methylated most and those flanked by C/G were methylated least. Given that a similar CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion pattern was observed for the human genome within which CpGs are not likely to be recognized by TLRs, we argue that the main source of CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion in HIV-1 is likely host-induced methylation. Analyses of CpG motifs in over 100 viruses revealed that this unique CpG representation pattern is specific to the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Cells alter their tRNA abundance to selectively regulate protein synthesis during stress conditions
<p>Decoding the information in mRNA during protein synthesis relies on tRNA adaptors, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of which can affect the decoding rate and translation efficiency. To determine whether cells alter tRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance to selectively regulate protein expression, we quantified changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of individual tRNAs at different time points in response to diverse stress conditions in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We found that the tRNA pool was dynamic and rearranged in a manner that facilitated selective translation of stress-related transcripts. Through genomic analysis of multiple data sets, stochastic simulations, and experiments with designed sequences of proteins with identical amino acids but altered codon usage, we showed that changes in tRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance affected protein expression independently of factors such as mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance. We suggest that cells alter their tRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance to selectively affect the translation rates of specific transcripts to increase the amounts of required proteins under diverse stress conditions.</p>

RORγt limits the amount of the cytokine receptor γc through the prosurvival factor Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in developing thymocytes
<p>The cytokine receptor subunit γc provides critical signals for T cell survival and differentiation. We investigated the molecular mechanism that controls the cell surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of γc during T cell development in the thymus. We found that the amount of γc was low on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) thymocytes before their positive selection to become mature T cells. The transcription factor RORγt was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in immature DP thymocytes, and its loss resulted in an increase in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of surface γc, specifically on preselection DP cells. Rather than directly repressing expression of the gene encoding γc, RORγt acted through the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> to reduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of surface γc, which resulted in decreased cytokine signaling and was associated with inhibition of cell metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, overexpression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in RORγt-deficient thymocytes restored the amount of surface γc to that present on normal preselection DP cells. Together, these data highlight a previously unappreciated role for RORγt and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in limiting γc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance at the cell surface and reveal a signaling circuit in which survival factors control cytokine signaling by limiting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and surface distribution of a receptor subunit shared by several cytokines.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin coating either solutions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al or precursors to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface.

The β<sub>4</sub> subunit of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels is required for an optimal interferon response in cardiac muscle cells
<p>The auxiliary β<sub>4</sub> subunit of the cardiac Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel plays a poorly understood role in gene transcription. Here, we characterized the regulatory effects of the β<sub>4</sub> subunit in H9c2 rat cardiac cells on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of <i>Ifnb</i> mRNA [which encodes interferon-β (IFN-β)] and of the IFN-β–related genes <i>Ddx58</i>, <i>Ifitm3</i>, <i>Irf7</i>, <i>Stat2</i>, <i>Ifih1</i>, and <i>Mx1</i>, as well as on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of the antiviral proteins DDX58, IRF7, STAT2, and IFITM3. Knocking down the β<sub>4</sub> subunit in H9c2 cells reduced the expression of IFN-β–stimulated genes. In response to inhibition of the kinase JAK1, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of β<sub>4</sub> subunit mRNA and protein were decreased. β<sub>4</sub> subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance was increased, and it translocated to the nucleus, in cells treated with IFN-β, infected with dengue virus (DENV), or transfected with poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA. Cells that surrounded the virus-infected cells showed translocation of β<sub>4</sub> subunit proteins to nuclei in response to spreading infection. We showed that the β<sub>4</sub> subunit interacted with the transcriptional regulator IRF7 and that the activity of an <i>Irf7</i> promoter–driven reporter was increased in cells overexpressing the β<sub>4</sub> subunit. Last, overexpressing β<sub>4</sub> in undifferentiated and differentiated H9c2 cells reduced DENV infection and decreased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the viral proteins NS1, NS3, and E-protein. DENV infection and poly(I:C) also increased the concentration of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in these cells. These findings suggest that the β<sub>4</sub> subunit plays a role in promoting the expression of IFN-related genes, thereby reducing viral infection.</p>

Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate is a major source of GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide production
<p>Phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes hydrolyze the plasma membrane (PM) lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>) to generate the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in response to receptor activation in almost all mammalian cells. We previously found that stimulation of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in cardiac cells leads to the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the Golgi, a process required for the activation of nuclear protein kinase D (PKD) during cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesized that GPCR-stimulated PLC activation leading to direct PI4P hydrolysis may be a general mechanism for DAG production. We measured GPCR activation–dependent changes in PM and Golgi PI4P pools in various cells using GFP-based detection of PI4P. Stimulation with various agonists caused a time-dependent reduction in PI4P-associated, but not PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>-associated, fluorescence at the Golgi and PM. Targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> from the PM before GPCR stimulation had no effect on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion of PM or Golgi PI4P, total inositol phosphate (IP) production, or PKD activation. In contrast, acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion of PI4P specifically at the PM completely blocked the GPCR-dependent production of IPs and activation of PKD but did not change the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>. Acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion of Golgi PI4P had no effect on these processes. These data suggest that most of the PM PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> pool is not involved in GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that PI4P at the PM is responsible for the bulk of receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and DAG production.</p>

PSMA redirects cell survival signaling from the MAPK to the PI3K-AKT pathways to promote the progression of prostate cancer
<p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate epithelium is a hallmark of advanced metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) and correlates negatively with prognosis. However, direct evidence that PSMA functionally contributes to PCa progression remains elusive. We generated mice bearing PSMA-positive or PSMA-negative PCa by crossing PSMA-deficient mice with transgenic PCa (TRAMP) models, enabling direct assessment of PCa incidence and progression in the presence or absence of PSMA. Compared with PSMA-positive tumors, PSMA-negative tumors were smaller, lower-grade, and more apoptotic with fewer blood vessels, consistent with the recognized proangiogenic function of PSMA. Relative to PSMA-positive tumors, tumors lacking PSMA had less than half the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), less activity in the survival pathway mediated by PI3K-AKT signaling, and more activity in the proliferative pathway mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. Biochemically, PSMA interacted with the scaffolding protein RACK1, disrupting signaling between the β<sub>1</sub> integrin and IGF-1R complex to the MAPK pathway, enabling activation of the AKT pathway instead. Manipulation of PSMA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in PCa cell lines recapitulated this signaling pathway switch. Analysis of published databases indicated that IGF-1R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance, cell proliferation, and expression of transcripts for antiapoptotic markers positively correlated with PSMA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in patients, suggesting that this switch may be relevant to human PCa. Our findings suggest that increase in PSMA in prostate tumors contributes to progression by altering normal signal transduction pathways to drive PCa progression and that enhanced signaling through the IGF-1R/β<sub>1</sub> integrin axis may occur in other tumors.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>es. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

Claudin-6, -10d and -10e contribute to seawater acclimation in the euryhaline puffer fish <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i>
<p>Expression profiles of <i>claudin-6, -10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> in the euryhaline teleost fish <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i> revealed <i>claudin-6</i> in brain, eye, gill and skin tissue, while <i>claudin-10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> were found in brain, gill and skin only. In fishes, the gill and skin are important tissue barriers that interface directly with surrounding water, but these organs generally function differently in osmoregulation. Therefore, roles for gill and skin claudin-6, -10d and -10e in the osmoregulatory strategies of <i>T. nigroviridis</i> were investigated. In the gill epithelium, claudin-6, -10d and -10e co-localized with Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase immunoreactive (NKA-ir) ionocytes, and differences in sub-cellular localization could be observed in hypoosmotic (freshwater, FW) versus hyperosmotic (seawater, SW) environments. Claudin-10d and -10e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance increased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW versus FW, while claudin-6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance decreased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW. Taken together with our knowledge of claudin-6 and -10 function in other vertebrates, data support the idea that in SW-acclimated <i>T. nigroviridis</i>, these claudins are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in gill ionocytes, where they contribute to the formation of a Na<sup>+</sup> shunt and ‘leaky’ epithelium, both of which are characteristic of salt-secreting SW fish gills. Skin claudin-10d and -10e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance also increased in fish acclimated to SW versus those in FW, but so did claudin-6. In skin, claudin-6 was found to co-localize with NKA-ir cells, but claudin-10d and -10e did not. This study provides direct evidence that the gill epithelium contains salinity-responsive tight junction proteins that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant primarily in ionocytes. These same proteins also appear to play a role in the osmoregulatory physiology of the epidermis.</p>

Decreased abundance of TRESK two-pore domain potassium channels in sensory neurons underlies the pain associated with bone metastasis
<p>Cancer-associated pain is debilitating. Understanding the mechanisms that cause it can inform drug development that may improve quality of life in patients. Here, we found that the reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of potassium channels called TRESK in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons sensitized nociceptive sensory neurons and cancer-associated pain. Overexpressing TRESK in DRG neurons suppressed tumor-induced neuronal hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in bone metastasis model rats, whereas knocking down TRESK increased neuronal hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in normal rats. Mechanistically, tumor-associated production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activated the receptor VEGFR2 on DRGs, which increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the calcineurin inhibitor DSCR1, which, in turn, decreased calcineurin-mediated activation of the transcription factor NFAT, thereby reducing the transcription of the gene encoding TRESK. Intrathecal application of exogenous calcineurin to tumor-bearing rats rescued TRESK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and abrogated both DRG hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity, whereas either inhibition or knockdown of calcineurin in normal rats reduced TRESK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and increased DRG excitability and pain sensitivity. These findings identify a potentially targetable mechanism that may cause bone metastasis–associated pain in cancer patients.</p>

MEG3-4 is a miRNA decoy that regulates IL-1β abundance to initiate and then limit inflammation to prevent sepsis during lung infection
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression. We investigated the role of lncRNAs in the inflammatory response to bacterial infection in the lungs. We identified the lncRNA MEG3 as a tissue-specific modulator of inflammatory responses during bacterial infection. Among the 10 transcript isoforms of MEG3, transcript 4 (referred to as MEG3-4) encodes the isoform with the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in mouse lungs. Nonetheless, we found that MEG3-4 bound to the microRNA miR-138 in a competitive manner with mRNA encoding the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), thereby increasing IL-1β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and intensifying inflammatory responses to bacterial infection in alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells in culture and in lung tissue in mice. MEG3-4–mediated sponging of miR-138 in the cytoplasm increased the autocrine activity of IL-1β that subsequently induced a negative feedback mechanism mediated by nuclear factor κB that decreased MEG3-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and inflammatory cytokine production. This timely reduction in MEG3-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance tempered proinflammatory responses in mice with pulmonary bacterial infection, preventing the progression to sepsis. Together, these findings reveal that MEG3-4 dynamically modulates pulmonary inflammatory responses through transcriptional regulation of immune response genes, extending the decoy and sponge mechanism associated with lncRNAs to antibacterial immunity, which affects both response and disease progression.</p>

We demonstrated that microtubules stabilized by detyrosination, a reversible posttranslational modification of polymerized α-tubulin, determined the stiffness of the cytoskeleton, which set the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to fluid shear stress. We showed that fluid shear stress through the microtubule network activated NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)–generated ROS that target the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel TRPV4 to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Furthermore, tuning the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of detyrosinated tubulin affected cytoskeletal stiffness to define the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to fluid shear stress. Finally, we demonstrated that NOX2-ROS elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that activated the kinase CaMKII to decrease the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of sclerostin protein. Together, these discoveries may identify potentially druggable targets for regulating osteocyte mechanotransduction to affect bone quality.</p>

Regulation of autophagy, NF-κB signaling, and cell viability by miR-124 in <i>KRAS</i> mutant mesenchymal-like NSCLC cells
<p><i>KRAS</i> mutant non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may be classified into epithelial or mesenchymal subtypes. Despite having the same “driver” mutation, mesenchymal NSCLCs are less responsive than are epithelial NSCLCs to inhibition of the RAS pathway. Identifying alternative networks that promote survival specifically in mesenchymal NSCLC may lead to more effective treatments for this subtype. Through their numerous targets in cellular signaling pathways, noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) often function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. In particular, some miRNAs regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We derived an EMT-related miRNA signature by profiling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of miRNAs in a panel of epithelial (KE) or mesenchymal (KM) <i>KRAS</i> mutant NSCLC cell lines. This signature revealed a number of suppressed miRNAs in KM cell lines, including members of the miR-200 family, which can suppress tumor progression by inhibiting EMT. Reconstituting KM cells with one of these miRNAs, miR-124, disrupted autophagy and decreased cell survival by reducing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of p62, which is both an adaptor for selective autophagy and a regulator of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Suppression of p62 by miR-124 correlated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the autophagy activator beclin 1 (BECN1), the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, and the NF-κB subunit RELA/p65. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of miR-124 inversely correlated with the expression of <i>BECN1</i> and <i>TRAF6</i> in patient NSCLC samples. These findings reveal how the loss of miR-124 promotes cell survival networks in the aggressive mesenchymal subtype of <i>KRAS</i> mutant NSCLC, which might lead to improved subtype-selective therapeutic strategies for patients.</p>

In silico modeling identifies CD45 as a regulator of IL-2 synergy in the NKG2D-mediated activation of immature human NK cells
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells perform immunosurveillance of virally infected and transformed cells, and their activation depends on the balance between signaling by inhibitory and activating receptors. Cytokine receptor signaling can synergize with activating receptor signaling to induce NK cell activation. We investigated the interplay between the signaling pathways stimulated by the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the activating receptor NKG2D in immature (CD56<sup>bright</sup>) and mature (CD56<sup>dim</sup>) subsets of human primary NK cells using mass cytometry experiments and in silico modeling. Our analysis revealed that IL-2 changed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of several key proteins, including NKG2D and the phosphatase CD45. Furthermore, we found differences in correlations between protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances, which were associated with the maturation state of the NK cells. The mass cytometry measurements also revealed that the signaling kinetics of key protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances induced by NKG2D stimulation depended on the maturation state and the pretreatment condition of the NK cells. Our in silico model, which described the multidimensional data with coupled first-order reactions, predicted that the increase in CD45 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance was a major enhancer of NKG2D-mediated activation in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells but not in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells. This dependence on CD45 was verified by measurement of CD107a mobilization to the NK cell surface (a marker of activation). Our mathematical framework can be used to glean mechanisms underlying synergistic signaling pathways in other activated immune cells.</p>

Mechanoresponsive self-growing hydrogels inspired by muscle training
<p>Living tissues, such as muscle, autonomously grow and remodel themselves to adapt to their surrounding mechanical environment through metabolic processes.

We propose a strategy for developing “self-growing” polymeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als that respond to repetitive mechanical stress through an effective mechanochemical transduction. Robust double-network hydrogels provided with a sustained monomer supply undergo self-growth, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als are substantially strengthened under repetitive loading through a structural destruction-reconstruction process. This strategy also endows the hydrogels with tailored functions at desired positions by mechanical stamping.

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials

A Program for Iron Economy during Deficiency Targets Specific Fe Proteins
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plants, utilized in nearly every cellular process. Because the adjustment of uptake under Fe limitation cannot satisfy all demands, plants need to acclimate their physiology and biochemistry, especially in their chloroplasts, which have a high demand for Fe. To investigate if a program exists for the utilization of Fe under deficiency, we analyzed how hydroponically grown Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) adjusts its physiology and Fe protein composition in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative photosynthetic tissue during Fe deficiency. Fe deficiency first affected photosynthetic electron transport with concomitant reductions in carbon assimilation and biomass production when effects on respiration were not yet significant. Photosynthetic electron transport function and protein levels of Fe-dependent enzymes were fully recovered upon Fe resupply, indicating that the Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion stress did not cause irreversible secondary damage. At the protein level, ferredoxin, the cytochrome-<i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, and Fe-containing enzymes of the plastid sulfur assimilation pathway were major targets of Fe deficiency, whereas other Fe-dependent functions were relatively less affected. In coordination, SufA and SufB, two proteins of the plastid Fe-sulfur cofactor assembly pathway, were also diminished early by Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion. Iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion reduced mRNA levels for the majority of the affected proteins, indicating that loss of enzyme was not just due to lack of Fe cofactors. SufB and ferredoxin were early targets of transcript down-regulation. The data reveal a hierarchy for Fe utilization in photosynthetic tissue and indicate that a program is in place to acclimate to impending Fe deficiency.</p>

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and zygotic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

SDG2-Mediated H3K4me3 Is Crucial for Chromatin Condensation and Mitotic Division during Male Gametogenesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming occurring during reproduction is crucial for both animal and plant development. Histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mark of transcriptional active euchromatin. While much has been learned in somatic cells, H3K4me3 deposition and function in gametophyte is poorly studied. Here, we demonstrate that SET DOMAIN GROUP2 (SDG2)-mediated H3K4me3 deposition participates in epigenetic reprogramming during Arabidopsis male gametogenesis. We show that loss of SDG2 barely affects meiosis and cell fate establishment of haploid cells. However, we found that SDG2 is critical for postmeiotic microspore development. Mitotic cell division progression is partly impaired in the loss-of-function <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant, particularly at the second mitosis setting up the two sperm cells. We demonstrate that SDG2 is involved in promoting chromatin decondensation in the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative nucleus, likely through its role in H3K4me3 deposition, which prevents ectopic heterochromatic H3K9me2 speckle formation. Moreover, we found that derepression of the LTR retrotransposon <i>ATLANTYS1</i> is compromised in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell of the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant pollen. Consistent with chromatin condensation and compromised transcription activity, pollen germination and pollen tube elongation, representing the key function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell in transporting sperm cells during fertilization, are inhibited in the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant. Taken together, we conclude that SDG2-mediated H3K4me3 is an essential epigenetic mark of the gametophyte chromatin landscape, playing critical roles in gamete mitotic cell cycle progression and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell function during male gametogenesis and beyond.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120

Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>e conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

Regulation of Vegetative Phase Change by SWI2/SNF2 Chromatin Remodeling ATPase BRAHMA
<p>Plants progress from a juvenile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase of development to an adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase of development before they enter the reproductive phase. miR156 has been shown to be the master regulator of the juvenile-to-adult transition in plants. However, the mechanism of how miR156 is transcriptionally regulated still remains elusive. In a forward genetic screen, we identified that a mutation in the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) exhibited an accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase change phenotype by reducing the expression of miR156, which in turn caused a corresponding increase in the levels of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> genes. BRM regulates miR156 expression by directly binding to the <i>MIR156A</i> promoter. Mutations in <i>BRM</i> not only increased occupancy of the −2 and +1 nucleosomes proximal to the transcription start site at the <i>MIR156A</i> locus but also the levels of trimethylated histone H3 at Lys 27. The precocious phenotype of <i>brm</i> mutant was partially suppressed by a second mutation in <i>SWINGER</i> (<i>SWN</i>), but not by a mutation in <i>CURLEY LEAF</i>, both of which are key components of the Polycomb Group Repressive Complex 2 in plants. Our results indicate that BRM and SWN act antagonistically at the nucleosome level to fine-tune the temporal expression of miR156 to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase change in Arabidopsis.</p>

Mitotic chromosome assembly despite nucleosome depletion in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts
<p>The nucleosome is the fundamental structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin. During mitosis, duplicated nucleosome fibers are organized into a pair of rod-shaped structures (chromatids) within a mitotic chromosome. However, it remains unclear whether nucleosome assembly is indeed an essential prerequisite for mitotic chromosome assembly. We combined mouse sperm nuclei and <i>Xenopus</i> cell-free egg extracts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ed of the histone chaperone Asf1 and found that chromatid-like structures could be assembled even in the near absence of nucleosomes. The resultant “nucleosome-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ed” chromatids contained discrete central axes positive for condensins, although they were more fragile than normal nucleosome-containing chromatids. Combinatorial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion experiments underscored the central importance of condensins in mitotic chromosome assembly, which sheds light on their functional cross-talk with nucleosomes in this process.</p>

Bragg coherent diffractive imaging of single-grain defect dynamics in polycrystalline films
<p>Polycrystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al properties depend on the distribution and interactions of their crystalline grains. In particular, grain boundaries and defects are crucial in determining their response to external stimuli. A long-standing challenge is thus to observe individual grains, defects, and strain dynamics inside functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. Here we report a technique capable of revealing grain heterogeneity, including strain fields and individual dislocations, that can be used under operando conditions in reactive environments: grain Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (gBCDI). Using a polycrystalline gold thin film subjected to heating, we show how gBCDI resolves grain boundary and dislocation dynamics in individual grains in three-dimensional detail with 10-nanometer spatial and subangstrom displacement field resolution. These results pave the way for understanding polycrystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al response under external stimuli and, ideally, engineering particular functions.</p>

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes
<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a plume of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al erupts from cracks in the ice. The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. The relatively high hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of methane from CO<sub>2</sub> in Enceladus’ ocean.</p>

Persistent effects of pre-Columbian plant domestication on Amazonian forest composition
<p>The extent to which pre-Columbian societies altered Amazonian landscapes is hotly debated. We performed a basin-wide analysis of pre-Columbian impacts on Amazonian forests by overlaying known archaeological sites in Amazonia with the distributions and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of 85 woody species domesticated by pre-Columbian peoples. Domesticated species are five times more likely than nondomesticated species to be hyperdominant. Across the basin, the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and richness of domesticated species increase in forests on and around archaeological sites. In southwestern and eastern Amazonia, distance to archaeological sites strongly influences the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and richness of domesticated species. Our analyses indicate that modern tree communities in Amazonia are structured to an important extent by a long history of plant domestication by Amazonian peoples.</p>

Combining polyethylene and polypropylene: Enhanced performance with PE/<i>i</i>PP multiblock polymers
<p>Polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (<i>i</i>PP) constitute nearly two-thirds of the world’s plastic.

Transformation of bulk alloys to oxide nanowires
<p>One dimensional (1D) nanostructures offer prospects for enhancing the electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties of a broad range of functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als and composites, but their synthesis methods are typically elaborate and expensive. We demonstrate a direct transformation of bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als into nanowires under ambient conditions without the use of catalysts or any external stimuli. The nanowires form via minimization of strain energy at the boundary of a chemical reaction front. We show the transformation of multimicrometer-sized particles of aluminum or magnesium alloys into alkoxide nanowires of tunable dimensions, which are converted into oxide nanowires upon heating in air. Fabricated separators based on aluminum oxide nanowires enhanced the safety and rate capabilities of lithium-ion batteries. The reported approach allows ultralow-cost scalable synthesis of 1D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als and membranes.</p>

Unusual Roles of Secretory SNARE SYP132 in Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Traffic and Vegetative Plant Growth
<p>The plasma membrane proton (H<sup>+</sup>)-ATPases of plants generate steep electrochemical gradients and activate osmotic solute uptake. H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-mediated proton pumping orchestrates cellular homeostasis and is a prerequisite for plastic cell expansion and plant growth. All evidence suggests that the population of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma membrane reflects a balance of their roles in exocytosis, endocytosis, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recycl</span></strong>ing. Auxin governs both traffic and activation of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins already present at the membrane. As in other eukaryotes, in plants, SNARE-mediated membrane traffic influences the density of several proteins at the plasma membrane. Even so, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic, its relationship with SNAREs, and its regulation by auxin have remained enigmatic. Here, we identify the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Qa-SNARE SYP132 (Syntaxin of Plants132) as a key factor in H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and demonstrate its association with endocytosis. SYP132 is a low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant, secretory SNARE that primarily localizes to the plasma membrane. We find that <i>SYP132</i> expression is tightly regulated by auxin and that augmented SYP132 expression reduces the amount of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma membrane. The physiological consequences of SYP132 overexpression include reduced apoplast acidification and suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth. Thus, SYP132 plays unexpected and vital roles in auxin-regulated H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and associated functions at the plasma membrane.</p>

Mitochondrial Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Contributes to Auxin-Regulated Organ Development
<p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme (E1) of the PDH complex (PDC). This multienzyme complex contains E1, E2, and E3 components and controls the entry of carbon into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle to enable cellular energy production. The E1 component of the PDC is composed of an E1α catalytic subunit and an E1β regulatory subunit. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are two mitochondrial E1α homologs encoded by <i>IAA-CONJUGATE-RESISTANT 4</i> (<i>IAR4</i>) and <i>IAR4-LIKE</i> (<i>IAR4L</i>), and one mitochondrial E1β homolog. Although IAR4 was reported to be involved in auxin conjugate sensitivity and auxin homeostasis in root development, its precise role remains unknown. Here, we provide experimental evidence that mitochondrial PDC E1 contributes to polar auxin transport during organ development. We performed genetic screens for factors involved in cotyledon development and identified an uncharacterized mutant, <i>macchi-bou 1</i> (<i>mab1</i>). <i>MAB1</i> encodes a mitochondrial PDC E1β subunit that can form both a homodimer and a heterodimer with IAR4. The <i>mab1</i> mutation impaired MAB1 homodimerization, reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of IAR4 and IAR4L, weakened PDC enzymatic activity, and diminished mitochondrial respiration. A metabolomics analysis showed significant changes in metabolites including amino acids in <i>mab1</i> and, in particular, identified an accumulation of Ala. These results suggest that MAB1 is a component of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial PDC E1. Furthermore, in <i>mab1</i> mutants and seedlings where the TCA cycle was pharmacologically blocked, we found reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers, possibly due to impaired PIN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recycl</span></strong>ing and enhanced PIN degradation in vacuoles. Therefore, we suggest that <i>mab1</i> induces defective polar auxin transport via metabolic abnormalities.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring seed oils to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low seed oil content and poor seedling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks efficient metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of seed HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant than any other fatty acid in these seeds, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in seeds following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. Efficient utilization of hydroxy-containing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-oil phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able for mobilization during seedling development, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in seedling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to efficiently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified oils in plants.</p>

HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation
<p>Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is coproduced with ethylene in plant cells and is primarily enzymatically detoxified by the mitochondrial β-CYANOALANINE SYNTHASE (CAS-C1). Permanent or transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alterations in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in protein content, identifying 451 proteins that are absent or less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 proteins that are only present or more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in <i>cas-c1</i>. Gene ontology classification of these proteins identified proteomic changes that explain the root hairless phenotype and the altered immune response observed in the <i>cas-c1</i> mutant. The mechanism of action of cyanide as a signaling molecule was addressed using two proteomic approaches aimed at identifying the <i>S-</i>cyanylation of Cys as a posttranslational modification of proteins. Both the 2-imino-thiazolidine chemical method and the direct untargeted analysis of proteins using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified a set of 163 proteins susceptible to <i>S-</i>cyanylation that included SEDOHEPTULOSE 1,7-BISPHOSPHATASE (SBPase), the PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE 20-3 (CYP20-3), and ENOLASE2 (ENO2). In vitro analysis of these enzymes showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation of SBPase Cys<sup>74</sup>, CYP20-3 Cys<sup>259</sup>, and ENO2 Cys<sup>346</sup> residues affected their enzymatic activity. Gene Ontology classification and protein-protein interaction cluster analysis showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation is involved in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, and the Calvin and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met cycles.</p>

Long-Day Photoperiod Enhances Jasmonic Acid-Related Plant Defense
<p>Agricultural crops are exposed to a range of daylengths, which act as important environmental cues for the control of developmental processes such as flowering. To explore the additional effects of daylength on plant function, we investigated the transcriptome of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants grown under short days (SD) and transferred to long days (LD). Compared with that under SD, the LD transcriptome was enriched in genes involved in jasmonic acid-dependent systemic resistance. Many of these genes exhibited impaired expression induction under LD in the <i>phytochrome A</i> (<i>phyA</i>), <i>cryptochrome 1</i> (<i>cry1</i>), and <i>cry2</i> triple photoreceptor mutant. Compared with that under SD, LD enhanced plant resistance to the necrotrophic fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. This response was reduced in the <i>phyA cry1 cry2</i> triple mutant, in the <i>constitutive photomorphogenic1</i> (<i>cop1</i>) mutant, in the <i>myc2</i> mutant, and in mutants impaired in DELLA function. Plants grown under SD had an increased nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of COP1 and decreased DELLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance, the latter of which was dependent on COP1. We conclude that growth under LD enhances plant defense by reducing COP1 activity and enhancing DELLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and <i>MYC2</i> expression.</p>

Extended Vernalization Regulates Inflorescence Fate in <i>Arabis alpina</i> by Stably Silencing <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i>
<p>The alpine perennial <i>Arabis alpina</i> initiates flower buds during prolonged exposure to cold. In the accession Pajares, we demonstrate that the length of vernalization influences flowering time and inflorescence fate but does not affect the axillary branches that maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth. The expression of floral organ identity genes gradually increases in the main shoot apex during vernalization, correlating with an increase in floral commitment. In northern Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions, the length of vernalization modulates the stable silencing of the floral repressor <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>). We demonstrate that expression of <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i> (<i>PEP1</i>), the ortholog of <i>FLC</i> in <i>A. alpina</i>, is similarly influenced by the duration of the exposure to cold. Extended vernalization results in stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence. In contrast, insufficient vernalization leads to <i>PEP1</i> reactivation after cold treatment, which correlates with delayed flowering and the appearance of floral reversion phenotypes such as bracts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative inflorescence branches. Floral reversion phenotypes are reduced in the <i>pep1-1</i> mutant, suggesting that <i>PEP1</i> regulates the fate of the inflorescence after vernalization. The effect of vernalization duration on stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> is specific to meristems that initiate flowering during cold treatment. Extended vernalization fails to silence <i>PEP1</i> in young seedlings and axillary branches that arise from buds initiated during cold treatment, which remain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative. We conclude that the duration of vernalization in <i>A. alpina</i> differentially regulates <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence and axillary branches. <i>PEP1</i> has a dual role regulating meristem fate; it prevents meristems from flowering and antagonizes inflorescence development after vernalization.</p>

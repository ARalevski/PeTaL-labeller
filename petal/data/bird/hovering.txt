Morphology, muscle capacity, skill, and maneuvering ability in hummingbirds
<p>How does agility evolve? This question is challenging because natural movement has many degrees of freedom and can be influenced by multiple traits. We used computer vision to record thousands of translations, rotations, and turns from more than 200 hummingbirds from 25 species, revealing that distinct performance metrics are correlated and that species diverge in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ering style. Our analysis demonstrates that the enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>erability of larger species is explained by their proportionately greater muscle capacity and lower wing loading. Fast acceleration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ers evolve by recruiting changes in muscle capacity, whereas fast rotations and sharp turns evolve by recruiting changes in wing morphology. Both species and individuals use turns that play to their strengths. These results demonstrate how both skill and biomechanical traits shape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ering behavior.</p>

A tailless aerial robotic flapper reveals that flies use torque coupling in rapid banked turns
<p>Insects are among the most agile natural flyers. Hypotheses on their flight control cannot always be validated by experiments with animals or tethered robots. To this end, we developed a programmable and agile autonomous free-flying robot controlled through bio-inspired motion changes of its flapping wings. Despite being 55 times the size of a fruit fly, the robot can accurately mimic the rapid escape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ers of flies, including a correcting yaw rotation toward the escape heading. Because the robotâ€™s yaw control was turned off, we showed that these yaw rotations result from passive, translation-induced aerodynamic coupling between the yaw torque and the roll and pitch torques produced throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>er. The robot enables new methods for studying animal flight, and its flight characteristics allow for real-world flight missions.</p>

Hydraulic control of tuna fins: A role for the lymphatic system in vertebrate locomotion
<p>The lymphatic system in teleost fish has genetic and developmental origins similar to those of the mammalian lymphatic system, which is involved in immune response and fluid homeostasis. Here, we show that the lymphatic system of tunas functions in swimming hydrodynamics. Specifically, a musculo-vascular complex, consisting of fin muscles, bones, and lymphatic vessels, is involved in the hydraulic control of median fins. This specialization of the lymphatic system is associated with fish in the family Scombridae and may have evolved in response to the demand for swimming and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ering control in these high-performance species.</p>

Avian thermoregulation in the heat: phylogenetic variation among avian orders in evaporative cooling capacity and heat tolerance
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Avian evaporative cooling efficiency and heat tolerance display substantial taxonomic variation that are, unexpectedly, not systematically related to the use of panting versus gular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flutter</span></strong> processes.</p>

Avian thermoregulation in the heat: metabolism, evaporative cooling and gular flutter in two small owls
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Small desert owls demonstrate heat tolerance intermediate between that of very heat-tolerant nightjars and less heat-tolerant passerines. The gular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flutter</span></strong> mechanism contributes significantly to cooling efficiency.</p>

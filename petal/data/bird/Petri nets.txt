Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s to transport resources and information. Biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s must trade-off <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> efficiency with the risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> failure. Yet, biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s with minimal length paths through the maze after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s in dynamic environments.</p>

Resolving Ambiguity of Species Limits and Concatenation in Multilocus Sequence Data for the Construction of Phylogenetic Supermatrices
<p>Public DNA databases are becoming too large and too complex for manual methods to generate phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic supermatrices from multiple gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. Delineating the terminals based on taxonomic labels is no longer practical because species identifications are frequently incomplete and gene trees are incongruent with Linnaean binomials, which results in uncertainty about how to combine species units among unlinked loci. We developed a procedure that minimizes the problem of forming multilocus species units in a large phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic data set using algorithms from graph theory. An initial step established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e clusters for each locus that broadly correspond to the species level. These clusters frequently include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es labeled with various binomials and specimen identifiers that create multiple alternatives for concatenation. To choose among these possibilities, we minimize taxonomic conflict among the species units globally in the data set using a multipartite heuristic algorithm. The procedure was applied to all available GenBank data for Coleoptera (beetles) including > 10 500 taxon labels and > 23 500 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es of 4 loci, which were grouped into 11 241 clusters or divergent singletons by the BlastClust software. Within each cluster, unidentified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es could be assigned to a species name through the association with fully identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, resulting in 510 new identifications (13.9% of total unidentified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es) of which nearly half were “trans-locus” identifications by clustering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es at a secondary locus. The limits of DNA-based clusters were inconsistent with the Linnaean binomials for 1518 clusters (13.5%) that contained more than one binomial or split a single binomial among multiple clusters. By applying a scoring scheme for full and partial name matches in pairs of clusters, a maximum weight set of 7366 global species units was produced. Varying the match weights for partial matches had little effect on the number of units, although if partial matches were disallowed, the number increased greatly. Trees from the resulting supermatrices generally produced tree topologies in good agreement with the higher taxonomy of Coleoptera, with fewer terminals compared with trees generated according to standard filtering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es using species labels. The study illustrates a strategy for assembling the tree-of-life from an ever more complex primary database.

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, reconstructing such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee reconstruction accuracy because pairwise ge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to construct a phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> from a multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in reconstructing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic distances than other conventional phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/Quartet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>/</ext-link>.</p>

The fundamental advantages of temporal networks
<p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>ed systems of scientific interest are characterized by temporal links, meaning the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>’s structure changes over time. Link temporality has been shown to hinder many dynamical processes, from information spreading to accessibility, by disrupting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> paths. Considering the ubiquity of temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s in nature, we ask: Are there any advantages of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s’ temporality? We use an analytical framework to show that temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s can, compared to their static counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand orders of magnitude less control energy, and have control trajectories, that are considerably more compact than those characterizing static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s. Thus, temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s, enhancing our ability to control them.</p>

Host DNases prevent vascular occlusion by neutrophil extracellular traps
<p>Platelet and fibrin clots occlude blood vessels in hemostasis and thrombosis. Here we report a noncanonical mechanism for vascular occlusion based on neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), DNA fibers released by neutrophils during inflammation. We investigated which host factors control NETs in vivo and found that two deoxyribonucleases (DNases), DNase1 and DNase1-like 3, degraded NETs in circulation during sterile neutrophilia and septicemia. In the absence of both DNases, intravascular NETs formed clots that obstructed blood vessels and caused organ damage. Vascular occlusions in patients with severe bacterial infections were associated with a defect to degrade NETs ex vivo and the formation of intravascular NET clots. DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 are independently expressed and thus provide dual host protection against deleterious effects of intravascular NETs.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s together resulted in improved performance compared to single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s.</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary ge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es and downloading those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic tree from the aligned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e.

The pseudokinase MLKL activates PAD4-dependent NET formation in necroptotic neutrophils
<p>Neutrophil extracellular trap (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>) formation can generate short-term, functional anucleate cytoplasts and trigger loss of cell viability. We demonstrated that the necroptotic cell death effector mixed lineage kinase domain–like (MLKL) translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and stimulated downstream NADPH oxidase–independent ROS production, loss of cytoplasmic granules, breakdown of the nuclear membrane, chromatin decondensation, histone hypercitrullination, and extrusion of bacteriostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>s. This process was coordinated by receptor-interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1), which activated the caspase-8–dependent apoptotic or RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptotic death of mouse and human neutrophils. Ge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic deficiency of RIPK3 and MLKL prevented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> formation but did not prevent cell death, which was because of residual caspase-8–dependent activity. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) was activated downstream of RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL and was required for maximal histone hypercitrullination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> extrusion. This work defines a distinct signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> that activates PAD4-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> release for the control of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) infection.</p>

Network Modeling Unravels Mechanisms of Crosstalk between Ethylene and Salicylate Signaling in Potato
<p>To develop novel crop breeding strategies, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between plants and their pathogens. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> modeling represents a powerful tool that can unravel properties of complex biological systems. In this study, we aimed to use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> modeling to better understand immune signaling in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>). For this, we first built on a reliable Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) immune signaling model, extending it with the information from diverse publicly available resources. Next, we translated the resulting prior knowledge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> (20,012 nodes and 70,091 connections) to potato and superimposed it with an ensemble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> inferred from time-resolved transcriptomics data for potato. We used different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> modeling approaches to generate specific hypotheses of potato immune signaling mechanisms. An interesting finding was the identification of a string of molecular events illuminating the ethylene pathway modulation of the salicylic acid pathway through Nonexpressor of PR Genes1 gene expression. Functional validations confirmed this modulation, thus supporting the potential of our integrative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> modeling approach for unraveling molecular mechanisms in complex systems. In addition, this approach can ultimately result in improved breeding strategies for potato and other sensitive crops.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p>Oil palm is the world’s leading source of vegetable oil and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of oil palm. The genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e of <i>Pisifera</i> is available whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed yet. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the oil palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing of 17 additional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high ge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic variation among palms from different geographical regions, but lower variation among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We mapped 10,000 SNPs on the linkage map of oil palm. In addition, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the oil palms used in breeding populations of Southeast Asia, suggesting that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this important oil crop. Our data provide a valuable resource for accelerating ge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic improvement and studying the mechanism underlying phenotypic variations of important oil palm traits.</p>

Structure, spatial dynamics, and stability of novel seed dispersal mutualistic networks in Hawai<bold></bold>i
<p>Increasing rates of human-caused species invasions and extinctions may reshape communities and modify the structure, dynamics, and stability of species interactions. To investigate how such changes affect communities, we performed multiscale analyses of seed dispersal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s on Oahu, Hawaii. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s consisted exclusively of novel interactions, were largely dominated by introduced species, and exhibited specialized and modular structure at local and regional scales, despite high interaction dissimilarity across communities.

Our findings suggest that shared evolutionary history is not a necessary process for the emergence of complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> structure, and interaction patterns may be highly conserved, regardless of species identity and environment.

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate immunity, a large part of which consists of one type of immune cell—the neutrophil. Neutrophils form the largest group of immune cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> neutrophils daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of toxic chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another neutrophil defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying neutrophils mix their nuclear DNA with toxic components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a neutrophil extracellular trap (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>) in the surrounding environment. This process is called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>osis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying ge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this immobilization on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>s, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cytotoxic molecules on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming immune complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>s has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together degrade freshly formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>s. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal immunopathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</p>

The BN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> contains an ionic liquid within its porous interior that allows electrolytic gating in a solid-like structure. Nanosheet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> channels display on:off ratios of up to 600, transconductances exceeding 5 millisiemens, and mobilities of >0.1 square centimeters per volt per second. Unusually, the on-currents scaled with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> thickness and volumetric capacitance. In contrast to other devices with comparable mobility, large capacitances, while hindering switching speeds, allow these devices to carry higher currents at relatively low drive voltages.</p>

Gcorn Plant: A Database for Retrieving Functional and Evolutionary Traits of Plant Genes
<p>Gene homology helps us understand gene function and speciation. The number of plant genes and species registered in public databanks is continuously increasing. It is useful to associate homologous genes of various plants to better understand plant speciation. We designed the Gcorn plant database for the retrieval of information on homology and evolution of a plant gene of interest. Amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es of 73 species (62 land plants and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, homologous genes were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a gene of interest, a phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic tree, connecting genes with high homology indices, and line charts of the numbers of genes with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous genes, and on a phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. Gcorn plant provides information on homologous genes at various virtual time points along with speciation in plants.</p>

Consensus Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Key Regulators of Flower and Fruit Development in Wild Strawberry
<p>The diploid strawberry, <i>Fragaria vesca</i>, is a developing model system for the economically important Rosaceae family. Strawberry fleshy fruit develops from the floral receptacle and its ripening is nonclimacteric. The external seed configuration of strawberry fruit facilitates the study of seed-to-fruit cross tissue communication, particularly phytohormone biosynthesis and transport. To investigate strawberry fruit development, we previously generated spatial and temporal transcriptome data profiling <i>F. vesca</i> flower and fruit development pre- and postfertilization. In this study, we combined 46 of our existing RNA-seq libraries to generate coexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s using the Weighted Gene Co-Expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> Analysis package in R. We then applied a post-hoc consensus clustering approach and used bootstrapping to demonstrate consensus clustering’s ability to produce robust and reproducible clusters. Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>s, including increased iron transport from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene.

DDM1 Represses Noncoding RNA Expression and RNA-Directed DNA Methylation in Heterochromatin
<p>C methylation of DNA, which occurs at CG, CHG, and CHH (H = A, C, or T) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es in plants, is a hallmark for the epige<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic repression of repetitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. The chromatin-remodeling factor DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION1 (DDM1) is essential for DNA methylation, especially at CG and CHG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. However, its potential roles in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and in chromatin function are not completely understood in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). In this work, we used high-throughput approaches to study the function of rice DDM1 (OsDDM1) in RdDM and the expression of noncoding RNA. We show that loss of function of OsDDM1 results in ectopic CHH methylation of transposable elements and repeats. The ectopic CHH methylation was dependent on rice DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE2, a DNA methyltransferase involved in RdDM. Mutations in <i>OsDDM1</i> lead to decreases of histone H3K9me2 and increases in the levels of heterochromatic small RNA and long noncoding RNA. In particular, OsDDM1 was found to be essential to repress the transcription of the two repetitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, Centromeric Retrotransposons of Rice1 and the dominant centromeric CentO repeats. These results suggest that OsDDM1 antagonizes RdDM at heterochromatin and represses the tissue-specific expression of noncoding RNA from repetitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es in the rice genome.</p>

Structure-Function Analysis of Chloroplast Proteins via Random Mutagenesis Using Error-Prone PCR
<p>Site-directed mutagenesis of chloroplast genes was developed three decades ago and has greatly advanced the field of photosynthesis research. Here, we describe a new approach for generating random chloroplast gene mutants that combines error-prone polymerase chain reaction of a gene of interest with chloroplast complementation of the knockout <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> mutant. As a proof of concept, we targeted a 300-bp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e of the <i>petD</i> gene that encodes subunit IV of the thylakoid membrane-bound cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing chloroplast transformants, we revealed 149 mutations in the 300-bp target <i>petD</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e that resulted in 92 amino acid substitutions in the 100-residue target subunit IV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e. Our results show that this method is suited to the study of highly hydrophobic, multisubunit, and chloroplast-encoded proteins containing cofactors such as hemes, iron-sulfur clusters, and chlorophyll pigments. Moreover, we show that mutant screening and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing can be used to study photosynthetic mechanisms or to probe the mutational robustness of chloroplast-encoded proteins, and we propose that this method is a valuable tool for the directed evolution of enzymes in the chloroplast.</p>

The G-Box Transcriptional Regulatory Code in Arabidopsis
<p>Plants have significantly more transcription factor (TF) families than animals and fungi, and plant TF families tend to contain more genes; these expansions are linked to adaptation to environmental stressors. Many TF family members bind to similar or identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e motifs, such as G-boxes (CACGTG), so it is difficult to predict regulatory relationships. We determined that the flanking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es near G-boxes help determine in vitro specificity but that this is insufficient to predict the transcription pattern of genes near G-boxes. Therefore, we constructed a gene regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> that identifies the set of bZIPs and bHLHs that are most predictive of the expression of genes downstream of perfect G-boxes.

ChloroKB: A Web Application for the Integration of Knowledge Related to Chloroplast Metabolic Network

Hierarchical and Spatially Explicit Clustering of DNA Sequences with BAPS Software
<p>Phylogeographical analyses have become commonplace for a myriad of organisms with the advent of cheap DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing technologies. Bayesian model-based clustering is a powerful tool for detecting important patterns in such data and can be used to decipher even quite subtle signals of systematic differences in molecular variation. Here, we introduce two upgrades to the Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) software, which enable 1) spatially explicit modeling of variation in DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es and 2) hierarchical clustering of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e data to reveal nested ge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic population structures.

Sequential Duplications of an Ancient Member of the DnaJ-Family Expanded the Functional Chaperone Network in the Eukaryotic Cytosol
<p>Across eukaryotes, Hsp70-based chaperone machineries display an underlying unity in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e, structure, and biochemical mechanism of action, while working in a myriad of cellular processes. In good part, this extraordinary functional versatility is derived from the ability of a single Hsp70 to interact with an array of J-protein cochaperones to form a functional chaperone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>. Among J-proteins, the DnaJ-type is the most prevalent, being present in all three kingdoms and in several different compartments of eukaryotic cells. However, because these ancient DnaJ-type proteins diverged at the base of the eukaryotic phylogeny, little is understood about the evolutionary basis of their diversification and thus the functional expansion of the chaperone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>. Here, we report results of evolutionary and experimental analyses of two more recent members of the cytosolic DnaJ family of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Xdj1 and Apj1, which emerged by sequential duplications of the ancient <i>YDJ1</i> in Ascomycota. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e comparison and molecular modeling revealed that both Xdj1 and Apj1 maintained a domain organization similar to that of multifunctional Ydj1. However, despite these similarities, both Xdj1 and Apj1 evolved highly specialized functions. Xdj1 plays a unique role in the translocation of proteins from the cytosol into mitochondria. Apj1’s specialized role is related to degradation of sumolyated proteins. Together these data provide the first clear example of cochaperone duplicates that evolved specialized functions, allowing expansion of the chaperone functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>, while maintaining the overall structural organization of their parental gene.</p>

Gene Capture Coupled to High-Throughput Sequencing as a Strategy for Targeted Metagenome Exploration
<p>Next-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing (NGS) allows faster acquisition of metagenomic data, but complete exploration of complex ecosystems is hindered by the extraordinary diversity of microorganisms. To reduce the environmental complexity, we created an innovative solution hybrid selection (SHS) method that is combined with NGS to characterize large DNA fragments harbouring biomarkers of interest. The quality of enrichment was evaluated after fragments containing the methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A gene (<i>mcrA</i>), the biomarker of methanogenesis, were captured from a <i>Methanosarcina</i> strain and a metagenomic sample from a meromictic lake. The methanogen diversity was compared with direct metagenome and <i>mcrA</i>-based amplicon pyro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing strategies<i>.</i> The SHS approach resulted in the capture of DNA fragments up to 2.5 kb with an enrichment efficiency between 41 and 100%, depending on the sample complexity. Compared with direct metagenome and amplicons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing, SHS detected broader <i>mcrA</i> diversity, and it allowed efficient sampling of the rare biosphere and unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. In contrast to amplicon-based strategies, SHS is less biased and GC independent, and it recovered complete biomarker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es in addition to conserved regions. Because this method can also isolate the regions flanking the target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, it could facilitate operon reconstructions.</p>

Targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas system in medaka
<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system-based RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN) has recently emerged as a simple and efficient tool for targeted genome editing. In this study, we showed successful targeted mutagenesis using RGENs in medaka, <i>Oryzias latipes</i>. Somatic and heritable mutations were induced with high efficiency at the targeted genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e on the <i>DJ-1</i> gene in embryos that had been injected with the single guide RNA (sgRNA) transcribed by a T7 promoter and capped RNA encoding a Cas9 nuclease. The sgRNAs that were designed for the target genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es without the 5′ end of GG required by the T7 promoter induced the targeted mutations. This suggests that the RGEN can target any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e adjacent to an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e, which occurs once every 8 bp. The off-target alterations at 2 genomic loci harboring double mismatches in the 18-bp targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es were induced in the RGEN-injected embryos. However, we also found that the off-target effects could be reduced by lower dosages of sgRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that CRISPR/Cas-mediated RGENs may be an efficient and flexible tool for genome editing in medaka.</p>

Tracing the origin and evolution of pseudokinases across the tree of life
<p>Protein phosphorylation by eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) is a fundamental mechanism of cell signaling in all organisms. In model vertebrates, ~10% of ePKs are classified as pseudokinases, which have amino acid changes within the catalytic machinery of the kinase domain that distinguish them from their canonical kinase counterparts. However, pseudokinases still regulate various signaling pathways, usually doing so in the absence of their own catalytic output. To investigate the prevalence, evolutionary relationships, and biological diversity of these pseudoenzymes, we performed a comprehensive analysis of putative pseudokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es in available eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal proteomes. We found that pseudokinases are present across all domains of life, and we classified nearly 30,000 eukaryotic, 1500 bacterial, and 20 archaeal pseudokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es into 86 pseudokinase families, including ~30 families that were previously unknown. We uncovered a rich variety of pseudokinases with notable expansions not only in animals but also in plants, fungi, and bacteria, where pseudokinases have previously received cursory attention. These expansions are accompanied by domain shuffling, which suggests roles for pseudokinases in plant innate immunity, plant-fungal interactions, and bacterial signaling. Mechanistically, the ancestral kinase fold has diverged in many distinct ways through the enrichment of unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e motifs to generate new families of pseudokinases in which the kinase domain is repurposed for noncanonical nucleotide binding or to stabilize unique, inactive kinase conformations. We further provide a collection of annotated pseudokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es in the Protein Kinase Ontology (ProKinO) as a new mineable resource for the signaling community.</p>

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known systems carrying out complex computations were biological nervous systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to brain circuits as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent computation by brain-like circuits (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical circuitry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>” (or deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>) architecture, this brain-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>s and related methods to AI systems has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central areas of AI research, including computer vision, speech recognition and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as computer vision and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of brain circuitry could supply cues for guiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

Social network plasticity decreases disease transmission in a eusocial insect

We tested this hypothesis experimentally in the ant <i>Lasius niger</i> using a combination of automated tracking, controlled pathogen exposure, transmission quantification, and temporally explicit simulations.

Centrality within this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> captured institutional prestige, allowing us to explore the career trajectory of individual artists in terms of access to coveted institutions. Early access to prestigious central institutions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central institutions. A Markov model predicts the career trajectory of individual artists and documents the strong path and history dependence of valuation in art.</p>

Systematic analysis of complex genetic interactions
<p>To systematically explore complex ge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic interactions, we constructed ~200,000 yeast triple mutants and scored negative trigenic interactions. We selected double-mutant query genes across a broad spectrum of biological processes, spanning a range of quantitative features of the global digenic interaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> and tested for a ge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic interaction with a third mutation. Trigenic interactions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong>. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic interactions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic interactions.

Structure of a prehandover mammalian ribosomal SRP·SRP receptor targeting complex
<p>Signal recognition particle (SRP) targets proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). SRP recognizes the ribosome synthesizing a signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e and delivers it to the SRP receptor (SR) on the ER membrane followed by the transfer of the signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e to the translocon. Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the mammalian translating ribosome in complex with SRP and SR in a conformation preceding signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e handover. The structure visualizes all eukaryotic-specific SRP and SR proteins and reveals their roles in stabilizing this conformation by forming a large protein assembly at the distal site of SRP RNA. We provide biochemical evidence that the guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis of SRP·SR is delayed at this stage, possibly to provide a time window for signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e handover to the translocon.</p>

Ring attractor dynamics in the <i>Drosophila</i> central brain

Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> structures, schematized as a ring of neurons whose connectivity depends on their heading preferences, can sustain a bump-like activity pattern whose location can be updated by continuous shifts along either turn direction.

DNA sequence-dependent epigenetic inheritance of gene silencing and histone H3K9 methylation
<p>Epige<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic inheritance mechanisms play fundamental roles in maintaining cellular memory of gene expression states. In fission yeast, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) is methylated (H3K9me) at heterochromatic domains. These domains can be epige<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ically inherited when <i>epe1<sup>+</sup></i>, encoding an enzyme that promotes H3K9 demethylation, is deleted. How native epige<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic states are stably maintained in <i>epe1<sup>+</sup></i> cells remains unknown. Here, we developed a system to examine the role of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e and genomic context in propagation of a cis-heritable H3K9me-dependent silenced state. We show that in <i>epe1<sup>+</sup></i> cells, in addition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e-independent mechanisms that propagate H3K9me, epige<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic inheritance of silencing requires binding sites for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e-dependent activating transcription factor (ATF)–adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element–binding protein (CREB) family transcription factors within their native chromosomal context.

The Coiled-Coil NLR <i>Rph1</i>, Confers Leaf Rust Resistance in Barley Cultivar Sudan

We cloned the first leaf rust resistance gene <i>Rph1</i> (<i>Rph1</i>.<i>a</i>) from cultivated barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) using “MutChromSeq,” a recently developed molecular genomics tool for the rapid cloning of genes in plants. Marker-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped <i>Rph1</i> to the short arm of chromosome 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the barley cv Morex reference assembly. A sodium azide mutant population in cv Sudan was generated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H chromosomes from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed and compared to identify candidate genes for the <i>Rph1</i> locus. MutChromSeq identified a single gene candidate encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate gene.

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing information provided by paired-end <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into biological systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic biology. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. Ten and 16 amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es that often influence discrete aspects of plant biology. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Six-Rowed Spike3 (VRS3) Is a Histone Demethylase That Controls Lateral Spikelet Development in Barley

We used RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing of allelic <i>six-rowed spike3</i> (<i>vrs3</i>) mutants with altered spikelet development for gene identification and functional analysis in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Variant calling in two allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed that <i>VRS3</i> encodes a putative histone Lys demethylase with a conserved zinc finger and Jumonji C and N domain. Sanger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing of this candidate gene in independent allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed a series of mutations in conserved domains, thus confirming our candidate as the <i>VRS3</i> gene and suggesting that the row type in barley is determined epige<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ically. Global transcriptional profiling in developing shoot apical meristems of <i>vrs3</i> suggested that VRS3 acts as a transcriptional activator of the row-type genes <i>VRS1</i> (<i>Hv.HOMEOBOX1</i>) and <i>INTERMEDIUM-C</i> (<i>INT-C</i>; <i>Hv.TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>). Comparative transcriptome analysis of the row-type mutants <i>vrs3</i>, <i>vrs4</i> (<i>Hv.RAMOSA2</i>), and <i>int-c</i> confirmed that all three genes act as transcriptional activators of <i>VRS1</i> and quantitative variation in the expression levels of <i>VRS1</i> in these mutants correlated with differences in the number of developed lateral spikelets.

CRISPR-Cas9 Targeted Mutagenesis Leads to Simultaneous Modification of Different Homoeologous Gene Copies in Polyploid Oilseed Rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>)
<p>In polyploid species, altering a trait by random mutagenesis is highly inefficient due to gene redundancy. We have stably transformed tetraploid oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) with a CRISPR-Cas9 construct targeting two <i>ALCATRAZ</i> (<i>ALC</i>) homoeologs. <i>ALC</i> is involved in valve margin development and, thus, contributes to seed shattering from mature fruits. Knocking out <i>ALC</i> would increase shatter resistance to avoid seed loss during mechanical harvest. We obtained a transgenic T1 plant with four <i>alc</i> mutant alleles by the use of a single target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e. All mutations were stably inherited to the T2 progeny. The T2 generation was devoid of any wild-type alleles, proving that the underlying T1 was a nonchimeric double heterozygote. T-DNA and <i>ALC</i> loci were not linked, as indicated by random segregation in the T2 generation. Hence, we could select double mutants lacking the T-DNA already in the first offspring generation. However, whole-genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing data revealed at least five independent insertions of vector backbone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. We did not detect any off-target effects in two genome regions homologous to the target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e.

Rapid Functional and Sequence Differentiation of a Tandemly Repeated Species-Specific Multigene Family in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene clusters of recently duplicated genes are hotbeds for evolutionary change. However, our understanding of how mutational mechanisms and evolutionary forces shape the structural and functional evolution of these clusters is hindered by the high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e identity among the copies, which typically results in their inaccurate representation in genome assemblies. The presumed testis-specific, chimeric gene <i>Sdic</i> originated, and tandemly expanded in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, contributing to increased male-male competition. Using various types of massively parallel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing data, we studied the organization, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e evolution, and functional attributes of the different <i>Sdic</i> copies. By leveraging long-read <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing data, we uncovered both copy number and order differences from the currently accepted annotation for the <i>Sdic</i> region. Despite evidence for pervasive gene conversion affecting the <i>Sdic</i> copies, we also detected signatures of two episodes of diversifying selection, which have contributed to the evolution of a variety of C-termini and miRNA binding site compositions. Expression analyses involving RNA-seq datasets from 59 different biological conditions revealed distinctive expression breadths among the copies, with three copies being transcribed in females, opening the possibility to a sexually antagonistic effect. Phenotypic assays using <i>Sdic</i> knock-out strains indicated that should this antagonistic effect exist, it does not compromise female fertility. Our results strongly suggest that the genome consolidation of the <i>Sdic</i> gene cluster is more the result of a quick exploration of different paths of molecular tinkering by different copies than a mere dosage increase, which could be a recurrent evolutionary outcome in the presence of persistent sexual selection.</p>

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Frequencies of Known Haplotypes from Pooled Sequence Data

Correlation between genome reduction and bacterial growth

Nevertheless, whether and how the accumulative loss of dispensable genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es disturbs bacterial growth remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between genome reduction and growth, a series of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains carrying genomes reduced in a stepwise manner were used. Intensive growth analyses revealed that the accumulation of multiple genomic deletions caused decreases in the exponential growth rate and the saturated cell density in a deletion-length-dependent manner as well as gradual changes in the patterns of growth dynamics, regardless of the growth media. Accordingly, a perspective growth model linking genome evolution to genome engineering was proposed. This study provides the first demonstration of a quantitative connection between genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e and bacterial growth, indicating that growth rate is potentially associated with dispensable genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es.</p>

RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing was performed on these cell populations to generate the transcriptome of the major cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. To complement our transcriptomic data, we also surveyed the epige<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic landscape of cardiomyocytes during postnatal maturation by performing deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing of accessible chromatin regions by using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin from purified mouse cardiomyocyte nuclei (P1, P14, and P56).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Profiling of cardiomyocyte and nonmyocyte transcriptional programs uncovered several injury-responsive genes across regenerative and nonregenerative time points. However, the majority of transcriptional changes in all cardiac cell types resulted from developmental maturation from neonatal stages to adulthood rather than activation of a distinct regeneration-specific gene program. Furthermore, adult leukocytes and fibroblasts were characterized by the expression of a proliferative gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> following infarction, which mirrored the neonatal state. In contrast, cardiomyocytes failed to reactivate the neonatal proliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> following infarction, which was associated with loss of chromatin accessibility around cell cycle genes during postnatal maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work provides a comprehensive framework and transcriptional resource of multiple cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. Our findings define a regulatory program underpinning the neonatal regenerative state and identify alterations in the chromatin landscape that could limit reinduction of the regenerative program in adult cardiomyocytes.</p></sec>

Optimizing a Drone Network to Deliver Automated External Defibrillators
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Public access defibrillation programs can improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are rarely available for bystander use at the scene. Drones are an emerging technology that can deliver an AED to the scene of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for bystander use. We hypothesize that a drone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> designed with the aid of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mathematical model</span></strong> combining both optimization and queuing can reduce the time to AED arrival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied our model to 53 702 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred in the 8 regions of the Toronto Regional Rescu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2014. Our primary analysis quantified the drone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> size required to deliver an AED 1, 2, or 3 minutes faster than historical median 911 response times for each region independently. A secondary analysis quantified the reduction in drone resources required if Rescu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> was treated as a large coordinated region.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The region-specific analysis determined that 81 bases and 100 drones would be required to deliver an AED ahead of median 911 response times by 3 minutes. In the most urban region, the 90th percentile of the AED arrival time was reduced by 6 minutes and 43 seconds relative to historical 911 response times in the region. In the most rural region, the 90th percentile was reduced by 10 minutes and 34 seconds. A single coordinated drone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> across all regions required 39.5% fewer bases and 30.0% fewer drones to achieve similar AED delivery times.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An optimized drone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work</span></strong> designed with the aid of a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mathematical model</span></strong> can substantially reduce the AED delivery time to an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest event.</p></sec>

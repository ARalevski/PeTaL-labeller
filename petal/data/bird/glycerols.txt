Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycerid</span></strong>es, fatty acids, phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, lysophospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, and galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s into the fragmentation of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Bioenergetics through thick and thin
<p>The cells in all biological systems are composed of a limited number of molecular constituents, mainly proteins, nucleic acids, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ates, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Of these, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s tend to receive the shortest shrift, as they are typically considered to be merely the building blocks of membranes that provide a scaffold in which the “important” molecules, such as enzymes or signaling proteins, reside. In recent years, and with the advent of advanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>omics techniques, we have learned that “a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>” is simply not true, and that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition of membranes can have profound effects on the behavior and activity of its resident macromolecules. For example, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, such as members of the phosphatidylinositol family, are important signaling molecules. However, what is less appreciated is that the physical composition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> membranes can have profound effects on cellular behavior as well. On page 1186 of this issue, Budin <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) use the Gram-negative bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> and the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as model systems to show that the fluidity of a membrane, as determined by its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, can have huge effects on the efficiency of aerobic energy production (respiration) by the highly hydrophobic, membrane-embedded, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system.</p>

Aberrant choice behavior in alcoholism
<p>More than 2 billion people worldwide regularly drink <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> is a component cause of more than 200 diseases and causes ∼3.3 million deaths per year globally (<i>1</i>). The major disease burden comes from harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> consumption and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> dependence. Not everyone who regularly consumes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> becomes dependent: ∼15% become engaged in harmful and compulsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> drinking (<i>2</i>). Patients suffering from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> dependence no longer have the freedom to choose between alternative rewards because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> drinking dictates what should be done next, namely, shaping activities for the next drink. On page 1321 of this issue, Augier <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that aberrant choice behavior—that is, choosing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> over an alternative reward—is a key driver for the transition from controlled to compulsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> use. They also provide a mechanistic understanding of this aberrant choice behavior that could lead to new treatment opportunities.</p>

Lipidomics Profiling and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in the Prospective Population-Based Bruneck Study
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The bulk of cardiovascular disease risk is not explained by traditional risk factors.

One hundred thirty-five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species from 8 different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> classes were profiled by shotgun <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>omics with the use of a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Levels of individual species of cholesterol esters (CEs), lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), sphingomyelins, and triacylglycerols (TAGs) were associated with cardiovascular disease over a 10-year observation period (2000–2010, 90 incident events). Among the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species with the strongest predictive value were TAGs and CEs with a low carbon number and double-bond content, including TAG(54:2) and CE(16:1), as well as PE(36:5) (<i>P</i>=5.1×10<sup>−7</sup>, 2.2×10<sup>−4</sup>, and 2.5×10<sup>−3</sup>, respectively).

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the phosphates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory protein PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional phosphate group to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A negative charge. Our findings demonstrate how bacteria tailor their cell surface to different stresses, such as those faced inside phagocytes.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Revisiting the Algal “Chloroplast Lipid Droplet”: The Absence of an Entity That Is Unlikely to Exist
<p>The precise localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets and the metabolic pathways associated with oil production are crucial to the engineering of microalgae for biofuel production. Several studies have reported detecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets within the chloroplast of the microalga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, which accumulates considerable amounts of triacylglycerol and starch within the cell under nitrogen deprivation or high-light stress conditions. Starch undoubtedly accumulates within the chloroplast, but there have been debates on the localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets, which are cytosolic organelles in other organisms. Although it is impossible to prove an absence, we tried to repeat experiments that previously indicated the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets in chloroplasts. Here, we present microscopic results showing no evidence for the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets within the chloroplast stroma, even though some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets existed in close association with the chloroplast or were largely engulfed by the chloroplasts. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets are cytosolic structures, distinct from the plastoglobules present in the chloroplast stroma. These results not only contrast with the old ideas but also point out that what were previously thought to be chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets are likely to be embedded within chloroplast invaginations in association with the outer envelope of the chloroplast without intervention of the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings point to the intriguing possibility of a tight metabolic flow from the chloroplast to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplet through a close association rather than direct contact of both organelles.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis in oil seeds is still not fully understood. Oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> distribution profiles observed imply differential regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oilseed rape productivity and quality.</p>

Glycerolipid Characterization and Nutrient Deprivation-Associated Changes in the Green Picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i>
<p>The picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i> is a minimal photosynthetic eukaryote that has been used as a model system. <i>O. tauri</i> is known to efficiently produce docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We provide a comprehensive study of the glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>ome of <i>O. tauri</i> and validate this species as model for related picoeukaryotes. <i>O. tauri</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s displayed unique features that combined traits from the green and the chromalveolate lineages. The betaine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> diacylglyceryl-hydroxymethyl-trimethyl-β-alanine and phosphatidyldimethylpropanethiol, both hallmarks of chromalveolates, were identified as presumed extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. DHA was confined to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, while plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s of prokaryotic type were characterized by the overwhelming presence of ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs), 18:5 being restricted to galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. C16:4, an FA typical of green microalgae galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, also was a major component of <i>O. tauri</i> extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, while the 16:4-coenzyme A (CoA) species was not detected. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) displayed the complete panel of FAs, and many species exhibited combinations of FAs diagnostic for plastidial and extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Importantly, under nutrient deprivation, 16:4 and ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated FAs accumulated into de novo synthesized TAGs while DHA-TAG species remained rather stable, indicating an increased contribution of FAs of plastidial origin to TAG synthesis. Nutrient deprivation further severely down-regulated the conversion of 18:3 to 18:4, resulting in obvious inversion of the 18:3/18:4 ratio in plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, TAGs, as well as acyl-CoAs. The fine-tuned and dynamic regulation of the 18:3/18:4 ratio suggested an important physiological role of these FAs in photosynthetic membranes. Acyl position in structural and storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s together with acyl-CoA analysis further help to determine mechanisms possibly involved in glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding butterflies.</p>

A molecular mechanism for choosing alcohol over an alternative reward
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> addiction leads to increased choice of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> over healthy rewards. We established an exclusive choice procedure in which ~15% of outbred rats chose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> over a high-value reward. These animals displayed addiction-like traits, including high motivation to obtain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> and pursuit of this drug despite adverse consequences. Expression of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter GAT-3 was selectively decreased within the amygdala of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>-choosing rats, whereas a knockdown of this transcript reversed choice preference of rats that originally chose a sweet solution over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>. GAT-3 expression was selectively decreased in the central amygdala of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>-dependent people compared to those who died of unrelated causes. Impaired GABA clearance within the amygdala contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> addiction, appears to translate between species, and may offer targets for new pharmacotherapies for treating this disorder.</p>

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low temperatures on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate concentrations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large increases in the sorbitol concentration of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-temperature responses. When trees were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling accumulation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol accumulation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling accumulation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling accumulation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different temperature effects more closely, we compared the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate concentrations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol concentration in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the temperatures when sufficient chilling accumulated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate concentration of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of accumulated chilling. Instead, as chilling accumulated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol accumulation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature responses on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty acid synthesis via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty acid peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty acids in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch synthesis and fatty acid turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty acid flux between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty acid β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty acid synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this compound in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s from oxidation. Both compounds preserved linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, carnosic acid was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical quencher of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

The Ancient Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling System Is a Master Regulator of Energy and Carbon Metabolism in Algae
<p>Algae undergo a complete metabolic transformation under stress by arresting cell growth, inducing autophagy and hyper-accumulating biofuel precursors such as triacylglycerols and starch. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this stress-induced transformation are still unclear. Here, we use biochemical, mutational, and “omics” approaches to demonstrate that PI3K signaling mediates the homeostasis of energy molecules and influences carbon metabolism in algae. In <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, the inhibition and knockdown (KD) of algal class III PI3K led to significantly decreased cell growth, altered cell morphology, and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> and starch contents. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> profiling of wild-type and PI3K KD lines showed significantly reduced membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> breakdown under nitrogen starvation (−N) in the KD. RNA-seq and network analyses showed that under −N conditions, the KD line carried out lipogenesis rather than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> hydrolysis by initiating de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, which was supported by tricarboxylic acid cycle down-regulation and via acetyl-CoA synthesis from glycolysis. Remarkably, autophagic responses did not have primacy over inositide signaling in algae, unlike in mammals and vascular plants. The mutant displayed a fundamental shift in intracellular energy flux, analogous to that in tumor cells. The high free fatty acid levels and reduced mitochondrial ATP generation led to decreased cell viability. These results indicate that the PI3K signal transduction pathway is the metabolic gatekeeper restraining biofuel yields, thus maintaining fitness and viability under stress in algae. This study demonstrates the existence of homeostasis between starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis controlled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> signaling in algae and expands our understanding of such processes, with biotechnological and evolutionary implications.</p>

A Central Role for Triacylglycerol in Membrane Lipid Breakdown, Fatty Acid <i>β</i>-Oxidation, and Plant Survival under Extended Darkness
<p>Neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism is a key aspect of intracellular homeostasis and energy balance and plays a vital role in cell survival under adverse conditions, including nutrient deprivation in yeast and mammals, but the role of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in plant stress response remains largely unknown. By thoroughly characterizing mutants defective in SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 (SDP1) triacylglycerol lipase or PEROXISOMAL ABC TRANSPORTER 1 (PXA1), here we show that TAG is a key intermediate in the mobilization of fatty acids from membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s for peroxisomal β-oxidation under prolonged dark treatment. Disruption of SDP1 increased TAG accumulation in cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets and markedly enhanced plant tolerance to extended darkness. We demonstrate that blocking TAG hydrolysis enhances plant tolerance to dark treatment via two distinct mechanisms. In <i>pxa1</i> mutants, in which free fatty acids accumulated rapidly under extended darkness, SDP1 disruption resulted in a marked decrease in levels of cytotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> intermediates such as free fatty acids and phosphatidic acid, suggesting a buffer function of TAG accumulation against lipotoxicity under fatty acid overload. In the wild type, in which free fatty acids remained low and unchanged under dark treatment, disruption of SDP1 caused a decrease in reactive oxygen species production and hence the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation, indicating a role of TAG in protection against oxidative damage. Overall, our findings reveal a crucial role for TAG metabolism in membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> breakdown, fatty acid turnover, and plant survival under extended darkness.</p>

IRE1α prevents hepatic steatosis by processing and promoting the degradation of select microRNAs
<p>Obesity or a high-fat diet represses the endoribonuclease activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), a transducer of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cells under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. An impaired UPR is associated with hepatic steatosis and non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>ic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation in the liver. We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> homeostasis in the liver by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the liver, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). A high-fat diet in mice or hepatic steatosis in patients was associated with the S-nitrosylation of IRE1α and inactivation of its endoribonuclease activity. This resulted in an increased abundance of these miRNA families in the liver and, consequently, a decreased abundance of their targets, which included peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) and the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), regulators of fatty acid oxidation and tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycerid</span></strong>e lipolysis. IRE1α deficiency exacerbated hepatic steatosis in mice. The abundance of the miR-200 and miR-34 families was also increased in cultured, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-overloaded hepatocytes and in the livers of patients with hepatic steatosis. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which IRE1α maintains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> homeostasis through its regulation of miRNAs, a regulatory pathway distinct from the canonical IRE1α-UPR pathway under acute ER stress.</p>

A lipase-independent pathway of lipid release and immune modulation by adipocytes
<p>To meet systemic metabolic needs, adipocytes release fatty acids and glycerol through the action of neutral lipases. Here, we describe a secondary pathway of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> release from adipocytes that is independent of canonical lipolysis. We found that adipocytes release exosome-sized, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-filled vesicles (AdExos) that become a source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> for local macrophages. Adipose tissue from lean mice released ~1% of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> content per day via exosomes ex vivo, a rate that more than doubles in obese animals. AdExos and associated factors were sufficient to induce in vitro differentiation of bone marrow precursors into adipose tissue macrophage–like cells. Thus, AdExos are both an alternative pathway of local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> release and a mechanism by which parenchymal cells can modulate tissue macrophage differentiation and function.</p>

Lipid-filled vesicles modulate macrophages
<p>Adipose (fat) tissue is a major site of energy storage that responds to fluctuations in nutrient availability to maintain systemic metabolic homeostasis (<i>1</i>). Adipocytes take up circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) from the blood and store them in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets in response to increased insulin concentrations (which occur after feeding); they then hydrolyze <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s to release FFAs under conditions of nutrient deprivation. A variety of other cell types are present within adipose tissue, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). In addition to their roles in immune surveillance and clearance of cellular debris, ATMs are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> buffering and regulate adipose tissue function in both healthy and diseased states (<i>2</i>). Owing to the rising global incidence of chronic obesity and associated health issues, there is renewed interest in understanding how adipose tissue functions in physiological and pathological settings. On page 989 of this issue, Flaherty <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that adipocytes communicate with ATMs by releasing a distinct class of extracellular vesicles (EVs) called adipocyte-derived exosomes (AdExos), which are loaded with fat and appear to be derived directly from adipocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets. The uptake of AdExos by resident ATMs allows for the direct transfer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, revealing a form of intercellular communication and nutrient exchange with important implications for obesity-associated pathologies.</p>

Viscous control of cellular respiration by membrane lipid composition
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition determines the physical properties of biological membranes and can vary substantially between and within organisms. We describe a specific role for the viscosity of energy-transducing membranes in cellular respiration. Engineering of fatty acid biosynthesis in <i>Escherichia coli</i> allowed us to titrate inner membrane viscosity across a 10-fold range by controlling the abundance of unsaturated or branched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. These fluidizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s tightly controlled respiratory metabolism, an effect that can be explained with a quantitative model of the electron transport chain (ETC) that features diffusion-coupled reactions between enzymes and electron carriers (quinones). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> unsaturation also modulated mitochondrial respiration in engineered budding yeast strains. Thus, diffusion in the ETC may serve as an evolutionary constraint for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition in respiratory membranes.</p>

mRNA structure determines specificity of a polyQ-driven phase separation
<p>RNA promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phase separation (LLPS) to build membraneless compartments in cells. How distinct molecular compositions are established and maintained in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> compartments is unknown. Here, we report that secondary structure allows messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to self-associate and determines whether an mRNA is recruited to or excluded from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> compartments. The polyQ-protein Whi3 induces conformational changes in RNA structure and generates distinct molecular fluctuations depending on the RNA sequence. These data support a model in which structure-based, RNA-RNA interactions promote assembly of distinct droplets and protein-driven, conformational dynamics of the RNA maintain this identity. Thus, the shape of RNA can promote the formation and coexistence of the diverse array of RNA-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> compartments found in a single cell.</p>

Fatty acids in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are synthesized by the host plant
<p>Plants form beneficial associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which facilitate nutrient acquisition from the soil. In return, the fungi receive organic carbon from the plants. The transcription factor RAM1 (REQUIRED FOR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZATION 1) is crucial for this symbiosis, and we demonstrate that it is required and sufficient for the induction of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> biosynthetic pathway that is expressed in plant cells accommodating fungal arbuscules. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s are transferred from the plant to mycorrhizal fungi, which are fatty acid auxotrophs, and this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> export requires the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase RAM2, a direct target of RAM1.

Mechanisms of Phosphorus Acquisition and Lipid Class Remodeling under P Limitation in a Marine Microalga
<p>Molecular mechanisms of phosphorus (P) limitation are of great interest for understanding algal production in aquatic ecosystems. Previous studies point to P limitation-induced changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition. As, in microalgae, the molecular mechanisms of this specific P stress adaptation remain unresolved, we reveal a detailed phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-recycling scheme in <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i> and describe important P acquisition genes based on highly corresponding transcriptome and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>ome data. Initial responses to P limitation showed increased expression of genes involved in P uptake and an expansion of the P substrate spectrum based on purple acid phosphatases. Increase in P trafficking displayed a rearrangement between compartments by supplying P to the chloroplast and carbon to the cytosol for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis. We propose a novel phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-recycling scheme for algae that leads to the rapid reduction of phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s and synthesis of the P-free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> classes. P mobilization through membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> degradation is mediated mainly by two glycerophosphoryldiester phosphodiesterases and three patatin-like phospholipases A on the transcriptome level. To compensate for low phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s in exponential growth, <i>N. oceanica</i> synthesized sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol and diacylglyceroltrimethylhomoserine. In this study, it was shown that an <i>N. oceanica</i> strain has a unique repertoire of genes that facilitate P acquisition and the degradation of phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s compared with other stramenopiles. The novel phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-recycling scheme opens new avenues for metabolic engineering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition in algae.</p>

The Arabidopsis <i>cer17</i> mutant was completely deficient in these monounsaturated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s, and <i>CER17</i> was found to encode a predicted ACYL-COENZYME A DESATURASE LIKE4 (ADS4). Studies of the Arabidopsis <i>cer4</i> mutant and yeast variously expressing <i>CER4</i> (a predicted fatty acyl-CoA reductase) with <i>CER17/ADS4</i>, demonstrated <i>CER4</i>’s principal role in synthesis of these monounsaturated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s. Besides unsaturated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> deficiency, <i>cer17</i> mutants exhibited a thickened and irregular cuticle ultrastructure and increased amounts of cutin monomers. Although unsaturated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s were absent throughout the <i>cer17</i> stem, the mutation’s effects on cutin monomers and cuticle ultrastructure were much more severe in distal than basal stems, consistent with observations that the <i>CER17/ADS4</i> transcript was much more abundant in distal than basal stems. Furthermore, distal but not basal stems of a double mutant deficient for both CER17/ADS4 and LONG-CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE1 produced even more cutin monomers and a thicker and more disorganized cuticle ultrastructure and higher cuticle permeability than observed for wild type or either mutant parent, indicating a dramatic genetic interaction on conversion of very long chain acyl-CoA precursors. These results provide evidence that CER17/ADS4 performs <i>n</i>-6 desaturation of very long chain acyl-CoAs in both distal and basal stems and has a major function associated with governing cutin monomer amounts primarily in the distal segments of the inflorescence stem.</p>

The Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein AtLtpI-4 Is Involved in Suberin Formation of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Crown Galls
<p>Nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer proteins reversibly bind different types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> molecules in a hydrophobic cavity. They facilitate phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer between membranes in vitro, play a role in cuticle and possibly in suberin formation, and might be involved in plant pathogen defense signaling. This study focuses on the role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer protein <i>AtLTPI-4</i> in crown gall development. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) crown gall tumors, which develop upon infection with the virulent <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> strain C58, highly expressed <i>AtLTPI-4</i>. Crown galls of the <i>atltpI-4</i> loss-of-function mutant were much smaller compared with those of wild-type plants. The gene expression pattern and localization of the protein to the plasma membrane pointed to a function of AtLTPI-4 in cell wall suberization. Since Arabidopsis crown galls are covered by a suberin-containing periderm instead of a cuticle, we analyzed the suberin composition of crown galls and found a reduction in the amounts of long-chain fatty acids (C<sub>18:0</sub>) in the <i>atltpI-4</i> mutant. To demonstrate the impact of AtLtpI-4 on extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, we expressed the protein in Arabidopsis epidermis cells. This led to a significant increase in the very-long-chain fatty acids C<sub>24</sub> and C<sub>26</sub> in the cuticular wax fraction. Homology modeling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-protein-overlay assays showed that AtLtpI-4 protein can bind these very-long-chain fatty acids. Thus, AtLtpI-4 protein may facilitate the transfer of long-chain as well as very-long-chain fatty acids into the apoplast, depending on the cell type in which it is expressed. In crown galls, which endogenously express AtLtpI-4, it is involved in suberin formation.</p>

Analysis of the shape fluctuations of reconstituted membranes using GUVs made from lipid extracts of invertebrates
<p>Changes in the physical properties of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> matrix of cell membranes have repeatedly been proposed to underlie stresses associated with e.g. drought, cold and xenobiotics. Therefore, the ability to experimentally monitor such properties is central to the fundamental physiological understanding of adaptive changes. Here, we test the analysis of shape fluctuations in membranes composed of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> extracts from two soil invertebrates, and show that theories and experimental approaches previously developed for simpler liposomes may be applied directly to reconstituted membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Specifically, we show how the bending rigidity of giant unilamellar liposomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> extracts can be determined precisely. We suggest that future measurements of this parameter could elucidate mechanisms of adaptive processes such as changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition and accumulation of protective osmolytes.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

A liquid phase of synapsin and lipid vesicles
<p>Neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles (SVs) form tight clusters at synapses. These clusters act as a reservoir from which SVs are drawn for exocytosis during sustained activity. Several components associated with SVs that are likely to help form such clusters have been reported, including synapsin. Here we found that synapsin can form a distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phase in an aqueous environment. Other scaffolding proteins could coassemble into this condensate but were not necessary for its formation. Importantly, the synapsin phase could capture small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> vesicles. The synapsin phase rapidly disassembled upon phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, mimicking the dispersion of synapsin 1 that occurs at presynaptic sites upon stimulation. Thus, principles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phase separation may apply to the clustering of SVs at synapses.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s, and esters, are formed when plant tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct plant defense at wound sites, indirect plant defense via the attraction of herbivore predators, and plant-plant communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for plants to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduction of C6-aldehydes into C6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde reduction remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant plants displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore infestation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested wild-type plants compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> plants, which corresponded with reduced C6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> plants were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered photosystem II activity. Our study shows that reductases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding toxicity from volatile carbonyls and in the attraction of herbivore predators.</p>

Identification and Metabolite Profiling of Chemical Activators of Lipid Accumulation in Green Algae
<p>Microalgae are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing biofuels and coproducts. However, several limitations must be overcome before algae-based production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this barrier, a chemical genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 compounds were screened against <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, and 243 compounds were identified that increase triacyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycerid</span></strong>e (TAG) accumulation without terminating growth. Identified compounds were classified by structural similarity, and 15 were selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth fitness, photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch concentrations. TAG accumulation was verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification of total fatty acids, and targeted TAG and galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> measurements were performed using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry. These results demonstrated that TAG accumulation does not necessarily proceed at the expense of galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into pathway shifts due to five different compound treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic stresses commonly used to induce oil accumulation in algae. The efficacy of these compounds also was demonstrated in three other algal species. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-inducing compounds offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the biochemical mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation in algae and a direct means to improve algal oil content independent of the severe growth limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.</p>

Membrane Proteomic Insights into the Physiology and Taxonomy of an Oleaginous Green Microalga
<p><i>Ettlia</i> <i>oleoabundans</i> is a nonsequenced oleaginous green microalga. Despite the significant biotechnological interest in producing value-added compounds from the acyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s of this microalga, a basic understanding of the physiology and biochemistry of oleaginous microalgae is lacking, especially under nitrogen deprivation conditions known to trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation. Using an RNA sequencing-based proteomics approach together with manual annotation, we are able to provide, to our knowledge, the first membrane proteome of an oleaginous microalga. This approach allowed the identification of novel proteins in <i>E. oleoabundans</i>, including two photoprotection-related proteins, Photosystem II Subunit S and Maintenance of Photosystem II under High Light1, which were considered exclusive to higher photosynthetic organisms, as well as Retinitis Pigmentosa Type 2-Clathrin Light Chain, a membrane protein with a novel domain architecture. Free-flow zonal electrophoresis of microalgal membranes coupled to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proved to be a useful technique for determining the intracellular location of proteins of interest. Carbon-flow compartmentalization in <i>E. oleoabundans</i> was modeled using this information. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of protein markers and 18S ribosomal DNA support the reclassification of <i>E. oleoabundans</i> within the trebouxiophycean microalgae, rather than with the Chlorophyceae class, in which it is currently classified, indicating that it may not be closely related to the model green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. A detailed survey of biological processes taking place in the membranes of nitrogen-deprived <i>E. oleoabundans</i>, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism, provides insights into the basic biology of this nonmodel organism.</p>

Seasonal accumulation of acetylated triacylglycerols by a freeze-tolerant insect
<p>Most animals store energy as long-chain triacylglycerols (lcTAGs). Trace amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in animals, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy density than lcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36% of the neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly, <i>Eurosta solidaginis</i>, while only 17% of the neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> pool is made up of typical lcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only during winter, appear to be synthesized by <i>E. solidaginis</i> and are not found in other freeze-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The mixture of acTAGs found in <i>E. solidaginis</i> has a significantly lower melting point than equivalent lcTAGs, and thus remains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> at temperatures at which <i>E. solidaginis</i> is frozen in the field, and depresses the melting point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of freeze tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an animal, and the first evidence of dynamic interconversion between acTAGs and lcTAGs during development and in response to stress.</p>

Electronic crystal growth

Bloch oscillations in the absence of a lattice

We found that the momentum distribution of the impurity exhibits characteristic Bragg reflections at the edge of an emergent Brillouin zone. Although Bragg reflections are typically associated with lattice structures, in our strongly correlated quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> they result from the interplay of short-range crystalline order and kinematic constraints on the many-body scattering processes in the one-dimensional system. As a consequence, the impurity exhibits periodic dynamics, reminiscent of Bloch oscillations, although the quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> is translationally invariant.

<i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> HtpG Interaction with nsLTP AsE246 Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation
<p>Plant nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are involved in a number of biological processes including root nodule symbiosis. However, the role of nsLTPs in legume-rhizobium symbiosis remains poorly understood, and no rhizobia proteins that interact with nsLTPs have been reported to date. In this study, we used a bacteria two-hybrid system and identified the high temperature protein G (HtpG) from <i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> that interacts with the nsLTP AsE246. The interaction between HtpG and AsE246 was confirmed by far-Western blotting and bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Our results indicated that the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) domain of HtpG mediates the HtpG-AsE246 interaction. Immunofluorescence assay showed that HtpG was colocalized with AsE246 in infected nodule cells and symbiosome membranes. Expression of the <i>htpG</i> gene was relatively higher in young nodules and was highly expressed in the infection zones. Further investigation showed that <i>htpG</i> expression affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> abundance and profiles in root nodules and plays an essential role in nodule development and nitrogen fixation. Our findings provide further insights into the functional mechanisms behind the transport of symbiosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s via nsLTPs in root nodules.</p>

Chloroplast Damage Induced by the Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthesis Triggers Autophagy in Chlamydomonas
<p>Fatty acids are synthesized in the stroma of plant and algal chloroplasts by the fatty acid synthase complex. Newly synthesized fatty acids are then used to generate plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s that are essential for chloroplast structure and function. Here, we show that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> activates autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic process by which cells degrade intracellular material under adverse conditions to maintain cell homeostasis. Treatment of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells with cerulenin, a specific fatty acid synthase inhibitor, stimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>ation of the autophagosome protein ATG8 and enhanced autophagic flux. We found that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis decreased monogalactosyldiacylglycerol abundance, increased lutein content, down-regulated photosynthesis, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species. Electron microscopy revealed a high degree of thylakoid membrane stacking in cerulenin-treated cells. Moreover, global transcriptomic analysis of these cells showed an up-regulation of genes encoding chloroplast proteins involved in protein folding and oxidative stress and the induction of major catabolic processes, including autophagy and proteasome pathways. Thus, our results uncovered a link between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism, chloroplast integrity, and autophagy through a mechanism that involves the activation of a chloroplast quality control system.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule proteins: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain amino acids or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule proteins. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key nodule proteins: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE Modulate Triacylglycerol and Phosphatidic Acid Production in the Plant Response to Freezing Stress
<p>Plants accumulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s phosphatidic acid (PA), diacylglycerol (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) during cold stress, but how plants balance the levels of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s to mediate cold responses remains unknown. The enzymes ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE (DGAT) and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE (DGK) catalyze the conversion of DAG to TAG and PA, respectively. Here, we show that DGAT1, DGK2, DGK3, and DGK5 contribute to the response to cold in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). With or without cold acclimation, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants exhibited higher sensitivity upon freezing exposure compared with the wild type. Under cold conditions, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants showed reduced expression of <i>C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR2</i> and its regulons, which are essential for the acquisition of cold tolerance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> profiling revealed that freezing significantly increased the levels of PA and DAG while decreasing TAG in the rosettes of <i>dgat1</i> mutant plants. During freezing stress, the accumulation of PA in <i>dgat1</i> plants stimulated NADPH oxidase activity and enhanced RbohD-dependent hydrogen peroxide production compared with the wild type. Moreover, the cold-inducible transcripts of <i>DGK2</i>, <i>DGK3</i>, and <i>DGK5</i> were significantly more up-regulated in the <i>dgat1</i> mutants than in the wild type during cold stress. Consistent with this observation, <i>dgk2</i>, <i>dgk3</i>, and <i>dgk5</i> knockout mutants showed improved tolerance and attenuated PA production in response to freezing temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the conversion of DAG to TAG by <i>DGAT1</i> is critical for plant freezing tolerance, acting by balancing TAG and PA production in Arabidopsis.</p>

FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 Connects Phospholipid Metabolism and Amyloplast Development in Rice
<p>Starch synthesized and stored in amyloplasts serves as the major energy storage molecule in cereal endosperm. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying amyloplast development and starch synthesis, we isolated a series of floury endosperm mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We identified the rice mutant <i>floury shrunken endosperm1</i> (<i>fse1</i>), which exhibited obvious defects in the development of compound starch grains, decreased starch content, and altered starch physicochemical features. Map-based cloning showed that <i>FSE1</i> encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A<sub>1</sub>. <i>FSE1</i> was expressed ubiquitously with abundant levels observed in developing seeds and roots. FSE1 was localized to both the cytosol and intracellular membranes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> profiling indicated that total extra-plastidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s and phosphatidic acid were increased in <i>fse1</i> plants, suggesting that FSE1 may exhibit in vivo phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> activity on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidyl-Ser, phosphatidylethanolamine, and, in particular, phosphatidic acid. Additionally, the total galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> content in developing <i>fse1</i> endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast development. Our results identify FSE1 as a phospholipase-like protein that controls the synthesis of galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s in rice endosperm and provide a novel connection between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism and starch synthesis in rice grains during endosperm development.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, including chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHO<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

The preferences of PPsPase1 and PECP1 for different substrates have been studied in vitro but require confirmation in planta. Here, we examined the in vivo function of both enzymes using a reverse genetics approach. We demonstrated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 affect plant phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine content, but not the pyrophosphate-related phenotypes. These observations suggest that the enzymes play a similar role in planta related to the recycling of polar heads from membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s that is triggered during phosphate starvation. Altering the expression of the genes encoding these enzymes had no effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, possibly due to compensation by other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> recycling pathways triggered during phosphate starvation. Furthermore, our results indicated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 do not influence phosphate homeostasis, since the inactivation of these genes had no effect on phosphate content or on the induction of molecular markers related to phosphate starvation. A combination of transcriptomics and imaging analyses revealed that PPsPase1 and PECP1 display a highly dynamic expression pattern that closely mirrors the phosphate status. This temporal dynamism, combined with the wide range of induction levels, broad expression, and lack of a direct effect on Pi content and regulation, makes PPsPase1 and PECP1 useful molecular markers of the phosphate starvation response.</p>

Sugar Potentiation of Fatty Acid and Triacylglycerol Accumulation
<p>Photosynthetically derived sugar provides carbon skeletons for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> biosynthesis. We used mutants of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and the expression of oleogenic factors to investigate relationships among sugar availability, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis, and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in leaf tissue. The <i>adg1</i> mutation disables the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the first step in starch synthesis, and the <i>suc2</i> mutation disables a sucrose/proton symporter that facilitates sucrose loading from leaves into phloem. The <i>adg1suc2</i> double mutant increases glucose plus sucrose content in leaves 80-fold relative to the wild type, total fatty acid (FA) content 1.8-fold to 8.3% dry weight, and TAG more than 10-fold to 1.2% dry weight. The WRINKLED1 transcription factor also accumulates to higher levels in these leaves, and the rate of FA synthesis increases by 58%. Adding <i>tt4</i>, which disables chalcone synthase, had little effect, but adding the <i>tgd1</i> mutation, which disables an importer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s into plastids to create <i>adg1suc2tt4tgd1</i>, increased total leaf FA to 13.5% dry weight and TAG to 3.8% dry weight, demonstrating a synergistic effect upon combining these mutations. Combining <i>adg1suc2</i> with the <i>sdp1</i> mutation, deficient in the predominant TAG lipase, had little effect on total FA content but increased the TAG accumulation by 66% to 2% dry weight. Expression of the <i>WRINKLED1</i> transcription factor, along with <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> and the <i>OLEOSIN1</i> oil body-associated protein, in the <i>adg1suc2</i> mutant doubled leaf FA content and increased TAG content to 2.3% dry weight, a level 4.6-fold higher than that resulting from expression of the same factors in the wild type.</p>

Spatial Mapping and Profiling of Metabolite Distributions during Germination
<p>Germination is a highly complex process by which seeds begin to develop and establish themselves as viable organisms. In this study, we utilize a combination of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> chromatography-fluorescence, and mass spectrometry imaging approaches to profile and visualize the metabolic distributions of germinating seeds from two different inbreds of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seeds, B73 and Mo17. Gas chromatography and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> chromatography analyses demonstrate that the two inbreds are highly differentiated in their metabolite profiles throughout the course of germination, especially with regard to amino acids, sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s, and small organic acids. Crude dissection of the seed followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of polar metabolites also revealed that many compounds were highly sequestered among the various seed tissue types. To further localize compounds, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging was utilized to visualize compounds in fine detail in their native environments over the course of germination. Most notably, the fatty acyl chain-dependent differential localization of phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s and triacylglycerols was observed within the embryo and radicle, showing correlation with the heterogeneous distribution of fatty acids. Other interesting observations include unusual localization of ceramides on the endosperm/scutellum boundary and subcellular localization of ferulate in the aleurone.</p>

The Enzyme Activity and Substrate Specificity of Two Major Cinnamyl Alcohol Dehydrogenases in Sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), SbCAD2 and SbCAD4
<p>Cinnamyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> dehydrogenase (CAD) catalyzes the final step in monolignol biosynthesis, reducing sinapaldehyde, coniferaldehyde, and <i>p</i>-coumaraldehyde to their corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s in an NADPH-dependent manner. Because of its terminal location in monolignol biosynthesis, the variation in substrate specificity and activity of CAD can result in significant changes in overall composition and amount of lignin. Our in-depth characterization of two major CAD isoforms, SbCAD2 (Brown midrib 6 [bmr6]) and SbCAD4, in lignifying tissues of sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for generating renewable chemicals and fuels, indicates their similarity in both structure and activity to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CAD5 and <i>Populus tremuloides</i> sinapyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> dehydrogenase, respectively. This first crystal structure of a monocot CAD combined with enzyme kinetic data and a catalytic model supported by site-directed mutagenesis allows full comparison with dicot CADs and elucidates the potential signature sequence for their substrate specificity and activity. The L119W/G301F-SbCAD4 double mutant displayed its substrate preference in the order coniferaldehyde > <i>p</i>-coumaraldehyde > sinapaldehyde, with higher catalytic efficiency than that of both wild-type SbCAD4 and SbCAD2. As SbCAD4 is the only major CAD isoform in <i>bmr6</i> mutants, replacing SbCAD4 with L119W/G301F-SbCAD4 in <i>bmr6</i> plants could produce a phenotype that is more amenable to biomass processing.</p>

Two Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases from <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Have Distinct Roles in Lipid Metabolism
<p>The metabolism of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is important for environmental stress responses by eukaryotic microalgae. G3P is an essential precursor for glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in response to nutrient starvation. G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH) mediates G3P synthesis, but the roles of specific GPDH isoforms are currently poorly understood. Of the five GPDH enzymes in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> were shown to be induced by nutrient starvation and/or salt stress. Heterologous expression of GPD2, a putative chloroplastic GPDH, and GPD3, a putative cytosolic GPDH, in a yeast <i>gpd1</i>Δ mutant demonstrated the functionality of both enzymes. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> knockdown mutants for <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> showed no difference in growth but displayed significant reduction in TAG concentration compared with the wild type in response to phosphorus or nitrogen starvation. Overexpression of <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> gave distinct phenotypes. <i>GPD2</i> overexpression lines showed only subtle metabolic phenotypes and no significant alteration in growth. In contrast, <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines displayed significantly inhibited growth and chlorophyll concentration, reduced glycerol concentration, and changes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition compared with the wild type, including increased abundance of phosphatidic acids but reduced abundance of di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycerid</span></strong>es, tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycerid</span></strong>es, and phosphatidylglycerol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. This may indicate a block in the downstream glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism pathway in <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> engineering by GPDH modification may depend on the activities of other downstream enzyme steps. These results also suggest that GPD2 and GPD3 GPDH isoforms are important for nutrient starvation-induced TAG accumulation but have distinct metabolic functions.</p>

Acyl-CoA-Binding Protein ACBP1 Modulates Sterol Synthesis during Embryogenesis
<p>Fatty acids (FAs) and sterols are primary metabolites that exert interrelated functions as structural and signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Despite their common syntheses from acetyl-coenzyme A, homeostatic cross talk remains enigmatic. Six Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) acyl-coenzyme A-binding proteins (ACBPs) are involved in FA metabolism. ACBP1 interacts with PHOSPHOLIPASE Dα1 and regulates phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition. Here, its specific role in the negative modulation of sterol synthesis during embryogenesis is reported. ACBP1, likely in a liganded state, interacts with STEROL C4-METHYL OXIDASE1-1 (SMO1-1), a rate-limiting enzyme in the sterol pathway. Proembryo abortion in the double mutant indicated that the ACBP1-SMO1-1 interaction is synthetic lethal, corroborating with their strong promoter activities in developing ovules. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed quantitative and compositional changes in FAs and sterols upon overexpression or mutation of <i>ACBP1</i> and/or <i>SMO1-1</i>. Aberrant levels of these metabolites may account for the downstream defect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> signaling. <i>GLABRA2</i> (<i>GL2</i>), encoding a phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>/sterol-binding homeodomain transcription factor, was up-regulated in developing seeds of <i>acbp1</i>, <i>smo1-1</i>, and <i>ACBP1</i>+/−<i>smo1-1</i> in comparison with the wild type. Consistent with the corresponding transcriptional alteration of GL2 targets, high-oil, low-mucilage phenotypes of <i>gl2</i> were phenocopied in <i>ACBP1</i>+/−<i>smo1-1</i>. Thus, ACBP1 appears to modulate the metabolism of two important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> classes (FAs and sterols) influencing cellular signaling.</p>

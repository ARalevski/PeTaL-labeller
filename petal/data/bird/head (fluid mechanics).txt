Impact of Practice-Based Management of Pulmonary Artery Pressures in 2000 Patients Implanted With the CardioMEMS Sensor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es in patients with heart failure are associated with a high risk for hospitalization and mortality. Recent clinical trial evidence demonstrated a direct relationship between lowering remotely monitored PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es and heart failure hospitalization risk reduction with a novel implantable PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e monitoring system (CardioMEMS HF System, St. Jude Medical). This study examines PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e changes in the first 2000 US patients implanted in general practice use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Deidentified data from the remote monitoring Merlin.net (St. Jude Medical) database were used to examine PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e trends from the first consecutive 2000 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up. Changes in PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es were evaluated with an area under the curve methodology to estimate the total sum increase or decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es (mm Hg-day) during the follow-up period relative to the baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. As a reference, the PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e trends were compared with the historic CHAMPION clinical trial (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e to Improve Outcomes in New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class III Heart Failure Patients). The area under the curve results are presented as mean±2 SE, and <i>P</i> values comparing the area under the curve of the general-use cohort with outcomes in the CHAMPION trial were computed by the <i>t</i> test with equal variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients were on average 70±12 years old; 60% were male; 34% had preserved ejection fraction; and patients were followed up for an average of 333±125 days. At implantation, the mean PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e for the general-use patients was 34.9±10.2 mm Hg compared with 31.3±10.9 mm Hg for CHAMPION treatment and 32.0±10.5 mm Hg for CHAMPION control groups. The general-use patients had an area under the curve of −32.8 mm Hg-day at the 1-month time mark, −156.2 mm Hg-day at the 3-month time mark, and −434.0 mm Hg-day after 6 months of hemodynamic guided care, which was significantly lower than the treatment group in the CHAMPION trial. Patients consistently transmitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e information with a median of 1.27 days between transmissions after 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The first 2000 general-use patients managed with hemodynamic-guided heart failure care had higher PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es at baseline and experienced greater reduction in PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e over time compared with the pivotal CHAMPION clinical trial. These data demonstrate that general use of implantable hemodynamic technology in a nontrial setting leads to significant lowering of PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es.</p></sec>

Association Between Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Blood Pressure Among Adults in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of sodium and lower levels of potassium intake are associated with higher blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. However, the shape and magnitude of these associations can vary by study participant characteristics or intake assessment method. Twenty-four–hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium are unaffected by recall errors and represent all sources of intake, and were collected for the first time in a nationally representative US survey. Our objective was to assess the associations of blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e and hypertension with 24-hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium among US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cross-sectional data were obtained from 766 participants age 20 to 69 years with complete blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e and 24-hour urine collections in the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the US noninstitutionalized population. Usual 24-hour urinary electrolyte excretion (sodium, potassium, and their ratio) was estimated from ≤2 collections on nonconsecutive days, adjusting for day-to-day variability in excretion. Outcomes included systolic and diastolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e from the average of 3 measures and hypertension status, based on average blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e ≥140/90 and antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After multivariable adjustment, each 1000-mg difference in usual 24-hour sodium excretion was directly associated with systolic (4.58 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.64–6.51) and diastolic (2.25 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.83–3.67) blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es. Each 1000-mg difference in potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (–3.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, –6.01 to –1.42).

Day-to-Day Blood Pressure Variability and Risk of Dementia in a General Japanese Elderly Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Several observational studies have reported that higher visit-to-visit blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e variability is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. However, no studies have investigated the association of day-to-day blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e variability assessed by home blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e measurement with the development of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 1674 community-dwelling Japanese elderly without dementia, ≥60 years of age, were followed up for 5 years (2007–2012). Home blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e was measured 3 times every morning for a median of 28 days. Day-to-day systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e variabilities, calculated as coefficients of variation (CoV) of home SBP and diastolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, were categorized into quartiles. The hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of the CoV levels of home blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e on the development of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia (VaD), and Alzheimer disease (AD) were computed with a Cox proportional hazards model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the follow-up, 194 subjects developed all-cause dementia; of these, 47 had VaD and 134 had AD. The age- and sex-adjusted incidences of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD increased significantly with increasing CoV levels of home SBP (all <i>P</i> for trend <0.05). These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including home SBP. Compared with subjects in the first quartile of CoV levels of home SBP, the risks of the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD were significantly higher in those in the fourth quartile (hazard ratio=2.27, 95% confidence interval=1.45–3.55, <i>P</i><0.001 for all-cause dementia; hazard ratio=2.79, 95% confidence interval=1.04–7.51, <i>P</i>=0.03 for VaD; hazard ratio=2.22, 95% confidence interval=1.31–3.75, <i>P</i><0.001 for AD). Similar associations were observed for CoV levels of home diastolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. Meanwhile, home SBP levels were significantly associated with the risk of VaD but not with the risks of all-cause dementia and AD.

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated ozone (1.4× ambient) and temperature (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. Temperature treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated temperature caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated temperature and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated temperature increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but temperatures are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e and O<sub>2</sub> optode measurements show that, during negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e periods, the tracheal partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its release.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated hemoglobin and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin concentration. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total hemoglobin concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Bmal1 in Perivascular Adipose Tissue Regulates Resting-Phase Blood Pressure Through Transcriptional Regulation of Angiotensinogen
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding vessels constitutes a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature required to preserve vascular tone under physiological conditions. However, there is little information on the relationship between PVAT and blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e regulation, including its potential contributions to circadian blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e variation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using unique brown adipocyte–specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and angiotensinogen knockout mice, we determined the vasoactivity of homogenized PVAT in aortic rings and how brown adipocyte peripheral expression of Bmal1 and angiotensinogen in PVAT regulates the amplitude of diurnal change in blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We uncovered a peripheral clock in PVAT and demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 in PVAT reduces blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in mice during the resting phase, leading to a superdipper phenotype. PVAT extracts from wild-type mice significantly induced contractility of isolated aortic rings in vitro in an endothelium-independent manner. This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte–selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local angiotensin II, operating through angiotensin II type 1 receptor–dependent signaling in the isolated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian regulation of angiotensinogen. Indeed, angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced. Systemic infusion of angiotensin II, in turn, reduced Bmal1 expression in PVAT while eliminating the hypotensive phenotype during the resting phase in BA-Bmal1-KO mice. Angiotensinogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective deletion of angiotensinogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective deletion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, angiotensinogen is a transcriptional target of Bmal1 in PVAT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data indicate that local Bmal1 in PVAT regulates angiotensinogen expression and the ensuing increase in angiotensin II, which acts on smooth muscle cells in the vessel walls to regulate vasoactivity and blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in a circadian fashion during the resting phase. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular complications of circadian disorders, alterations in the circadian dipping phenotype, and cross-talk between systemic and peripheral regulation of blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e.</p></sec>

Physiology of Angina and Its Alleviation With Nitroglycerin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms governing exercise-induced angina and its alleviation by the most commonly used antianginal drug, nitroglycerin, are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a method by which the effects of antianginal drugs could be evaluated invasively during physiological exercise to gain further understanding of the clinical impact of angina and nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty patients (mean age, 65.2±7.6 years) with exertional angina and coronary artery disease underwent cardiac catheterization via radial access and performed incremental exercise using a supine cycle ergometer. As they developed limiting angina, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered to half the patients, and all patients continued to exercise for 2 minutes at the same workload. Throughout exercise, distal coronary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e and flow velocity and central aortic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e were recorded with sensor wires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients continued to exercise after nitroglycerin administration with less ST-segment depression (<i>P</i>=0.003) and therefore myocardial ischemia. Significant reductions in afterload (aortic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, <i>P</i>=0.030) and myocardial oxygen demand were seen (tension-time index, <i>P</i>=0.024; rate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e product, <i>P</i>=0.046), as well as an increase in myocardial oxygen supply (Buckberg index, <i>P</i>=0.017). Exercise reduced peripheral arterial wave reflection (<i>P</i><0.05), which was not further augmented by the administration of nitroglycerin (<i>P</i>=0.648). The observed increases in coronary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e gradient, stenosis resistance, and flow velocity did not reach statistical significance; however, the diastolic velocity–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e gradient relation was consistent with a significant increase in relative stenosis severity (k coefficient, <i>P</i><0.0001), in keeping with exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments and dilatation of normal segments, with trends toward reversal with nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The catheterization laboratory protocol provides a model to study myocardial ischemia and the actions of novel and established antianginal drugs. Administration of nitroglycerin causes changes in the systemic and coronary circulation that combine to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and to increase supply, thereby attenuating exercise-induced ischemia. Designing antianginal therapies that exploit these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec>

Interleukin-10 Inhibits Bone Marrow Fibroblast Progenitor Cell–Mediated Cardiac Fibrosis in Pressure-Overloaded Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) play a critical role in cardiac fibrosis; however, their origin in the diseased heart remains unclear, warranting further investigation. Recent studies suggest the contribution of bone marrow fibroblast progenitor cells (BM-FPCs) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload–induced cardiac fibrosis. We have previously shown that interleukin-10 (IL10) suppresses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload–induced cardiac fibrosis; however, the role of IL10 in inhibition of BM-FPC–mediated cardiac fibrosis is not known. We hypothesized that IL10 inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload–induced homing of BM-FPCs to the heart and their transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts and thus attenuates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload was induced in wild-type (WT) and IL10 knockout (IL10KO) mice by transverse aortic constriction. To determine the bone marrow origin, chimeric mice were created with enhanced green fluorescent protein WT mice marrow to the IL10KO mice. For mechanistic studies, FPCs were isolated from mouse bone marrow.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload enhanced BM-FPC mobilization and homing in IL10KO mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, WT bone marrow (from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice) transplantation in bone marrow–depleted IL10KO mice (IL10KO chimeric mice) reduced transverse aortic constriction–induced BM-FPC mobilization compared with IL10KO mice. Green fluorescent protein costaining with α-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1α in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric mice suggests that myofibroblasts were derived from bone marrow after transverse aortic constriction. Finally, WT bone marrow transplantation in IL10KO mice inhibited transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac fibrosis and improved heart function. At the molecular level, IL10 treatment significantly inhibited transforming growth factor-β–induced transdifferentiation and fibrotic signaling in WT BM-FPCs in vitro. Furthermore, fibrosis-associated microRNA (miRNA) expression was highly upregulated in IL10KO-FPCs compared with WT-FPCs. Polymerase chain reaction–based selective miRNA analysis revealed that transforming growth factor-β–induced enhanced expression of fibrosis-associated miRNAs (miRNA-21, -145, and -208) was significantly inhibited by IL10. Restoration of miRNA-21 levels suppressed the IL10 effects on transforming growth factor-β–induced fibrotic signaling in BM-FPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that IL10 inhibits BM-FPC homing and transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e-overloaded myocardium. Mechanistically, we show for the first time that IL10 suppresses Smad–miRNA-21–mediated activation of BM-FPCs and thus modulates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec>

Comparative Prognostic Utility of Indexes of Microvascular Function Alone or in Combination in Patients With an Acute ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is frequently successful at restoring coronary artery blood flow in patients with acute ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction; however, failed myocardial reperfusion commonly passes undetected in up to half of these patients.

We aimed to investigate the pathological and prognostic significance of an IMR>40, alone or in combination with a coronary flow reserve (CFR≤2.0), in the culprit artery after emergency percutaneous coronary intervention for acute ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with acute ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction were prospectively enrolled during emergency percutaneous coronary intervention and categorized according to IMR (≤40 or >40) and CFR (≤2.0 or >2.0). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was acquired 2 days and 6 months after myocardial infarction. All-cause death or first heart failure hospitalization was a prespecified outcome (median follow-up, 845 days).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IMR and CFR were measured in the culprit artery at the end of percutaneous coronary intervention in 283 patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction (mean±SD age, 60±12 years; 73% male). The median IMR and CFR were 25 (interquartile range, 15–48) and 1.6 (interquartile range, 1.1–2.1), respectively. An IMR>40 was a multivariable associate of myocardial hemorrhage (odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–4.27; <i>P</i>=0.042). An IMR>40 was closely associated with microvascular obstruction. Symptom-to-reperfusion time, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) blush grade, and no (≤30%) ST-segment resolution were not associated with these pathologies. An IMR>40 was a multivariable associate of the changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (coefficient, −2.12; 95% confidence interval, −4.02 to −0.23; <i>P</i>=0.028) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (coefficient, 7.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–15.29; <i>P</i>=0.039) at 6 months independently of infarct size. An IMR>40 (odds ratio, 4.36; 95% confidence interval, 2.10–9.06; <i>P</i><0.001) was a multivariable associate of all-cause death or heart failure.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem hydraulic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e inducing 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e inducing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage loss of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, but its hydraulic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Exploring Coronary Circulatory Response to Stenosis and Its Association With Invasive Physiologic Indexes Using Absolute Myocardial Blood Flow and Coronary Pressure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although invasive physiological assessment for coronary stenosis has become a standard practice to guide treatment strategy, coronary circulatory response and changes in invasive physiological indexes, according to different anatomic and hemodynamic lesion severity, have not been fully demonstrated in patients with coronary artery disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred fifteen patients with left anterior descending artery stenosis who underwent both <sup>13</sup>N-ammonia positron emission tomography and invasive physiological measurement were analyzed.

Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thrombus aspiration during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been widely used; however, recent trials have questioned its value and safety. In this meta-analysis, we, the trial investigators, aimed to pool the individual patient data from these trials to determine the benefits and risks of thrombus aspiration during PCI in patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Included were large (n≥1000), randomized, controlled trials comparing manual thrombectomy and PCI alone in patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction. Individual patient data were provided by the leadership of each trial. The prespecified primary efficacy outcome was cardiovascular mortality within 30 days, and the primary safety outcome was stroke or transient ischemic attack within 30 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 3 eligible randomized trials (TAPAS [Thrombus Aspiration During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction], TASTE [Thrombus Aspiration in ST-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation Myocardial Infarction in Scandinavia], and TOTAL [Trial of Routine Aspiration Thrombectomy With PCI Versus PCI Alone in Patients With STEMI]) enrolled 19 047 patients, of whom 18 306 underwent PCI and were included in the primary analysis. Cardiovascular death at 30 days occurred in 221 of 9155 patients (2.4%) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 262 of 9151 (2.9%) randomized to PCI alone (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.06).

There were no significant differences in recurrent myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, heart failure, or target vessel revascularization. In the subgroup with high thrombus burden (TIMI [Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction] thrombus grade ≥3), thrombus aspiration was associated with fewer cardiovascular deaths (170 [2.5%] versus 205 [3.1%]; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.03) and with more strokes or transient ischemic attacks (55 [0.9%] versus 34 [0.5%]; odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–2.42, <i>P</i>=0.04).

A PLCγ1-Dependent, Force-Sensitive Signaling Network in the Myogenic Constriction of Cerebral Arteries
<sec><title>Maintaining Blood Flow to the Brain</title><p>Cerebral arteries continually adjust to changes in blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e to ensure constant blood flow to the brain. In response to increased blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, the smooth muscle cells in cerebral arteries contract, resulting in blood vessel constriction. This response requires two cell surface ion channels—TRPC6, a channel that is activated by the stretch caused by increased blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, and TRPM4, a channel that triggers the electrical impulses necessary for blood vessel constriction. Gonzales <i>et al.</i> found that activation of TRPC6 stimulated TRPM4 through calcium-dependent pathways. TRPC6, TRPM4, and the enzyme PLCγ1 were located in close proximity to each other in smooth muscle cells, indicating that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e-sensitive signaling network keeps blood flowing in the brain.</p></sec>

Fluid-induced aseismic fault slip outpaces pore-fluid migration
<p>Earthquake swarms attributed to subsurface fluid injection are usually assumed to occur on faults destabilized by increased pore-fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es. However, fluid injection could also activate aseismic slip, which might outpace pore-fluid migration and transmit earthquake-triggering stress changes beyond the fluid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>ized region. We tested this theoretical prediction against data derived from fluid-injection experiments that activated and measured slow, aseismic slip on preexisting, shallow faults. We found that the pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Using a coupled shear-rupture model, we derived constraints on the hydromechanical parameters of the actively deforming fault. The inferred aseismic rupture front propagates faster and to larger distances than the diffusion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>ized pore fluid.</p>

A bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve
<p>The distributed network of receptors, neurons, and synapses in the somatosensory system efficiently processes complex tactile information. We used flexible organic electronics to mimic the functions of a sensory nerve. Our artificial afferent nerve collects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e information (1 to 80 kilopascals) from clusters of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e sensors, converts the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e information into action potentials (0 to 100 hertz) by using ring oscillators, and integrates the action potentials from multiple ring oscillators with a synaptic transistor. Biomimetic hierarchical structures can detect movement of an object, combine simultaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e inputs, and distinguish braille characters. Furthermore, we connected our artificial afferent nerve to motor nerves to construct a hybrid bioelectronic reflex arc to actuate muscles. Our system has potential applications in neurorobotics and neuroprosthetics.</p>

One-third of global protected land is under intense human pressure
<p>In an era of massive biodiversity loss, the greatest conservation success story has been the growth of protected land globally. Protected areas are the primary defense against biodiversity loss, but extensive human activity within their boundaries can undermine this. Using the most comprehensive global map of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, we show that 6 million square kilometers (32.8%) of protected land is under intense human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. For protected areas designated before the Convention on Biological Diversity was ratified in 1992, 55% have since experienced human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e increases. These increases were lowest in large, strict protected areas, showing that they are potentially effective, at least in some nations.

Surface uplift and time-dependent seismic hazard due to fluid injection in eastern Texas
<p>Observations that unequivocally link seismicity and wastewater injection are scarce. Here we show that wastewater injection in eastern Texas causes uplift, detectable in radar interferometric data up to >8 kilometers from the wells. Using measurements of uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. We infer that an increase of >1 megapascal in pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8–moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined, owing to diffusion of pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e from earlier periods with higher injection rates. Induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining formations prevent pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e from propagating into crystalline basement rocks.</p>

Crohn's Disease Loci Are Common Targets of Protozoa-Driven Selection
<p>Previous studies indicated that a few risk variants for autoimmune diseases are subject to pathogen-driven selection. Nonetheless, the proportion of risk loci that has been targeted by pathogens and the type of infectious agent(s) that exerted the strongest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e remain to be evaluated. We assessed whether different pathogens exerted a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e on known Crohn's disease (CD) risk variants and demonstrate that these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are preferential targets of protozoa-driven selection (<i>P</i> = 0.008). In particular, 19% of SNPs associated with CD have been subject to protozoa-driven selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. Analysis of <i>P</i> values from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and meta-analyses indicated that protozoan-selected SNPs display significantly stronger association with CD compared with nonselected variants. This same behavior was not observed for GWASs of other autoimmune diseases. Thus, we integrated selection signatures and meta-analysis results to prioritize five genic SNPs for replication in an Italian cohort. Three SNPs were significantly associated with CD risk, and combination with meta-analysis results yielded <i>P</i> values < 4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. The bona fide risk alleles are located in <i>ARHGEF2</i>, an interactor of <i>NOD2, NSF</i>, a gene involved in autophagy, and <i>HEBP1</i>, encoding a possible mediator of inflammation. Pathway analysis indicated that <i>ARHGEF2</i> and <i>NSF</i> participate in a molecular network, which also contains <i>VAMP3</i> (previously associated to CD) and is centered around miR-31 (known to be disregulated in CD). Thus, we show that protozoa-driven selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e had a major role in shaping predisposition to CD. We next used this information for the identification of three bona fide novel susceptibility loci.</p>

Reduction of blood oxygen levels enhances postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in Burmese python (<i>Python bivittatus</i>)
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by reversible enlargement of cardiomyocytes and changes in chamber architecture, which increase stroke volume and [Formula] via augmented convective oxygen transport. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to occur in response to repeated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ations of O<sub>2</sub> demand and/or reduced O<sub>2</sub> supply in several species of vertebrate ectotherms, including postprandial Burmese pythons (<i>Python bivittatus</i>). Recent data suggest postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in <i>P. bivittatus</i> is a facultative rather than obligatory response to digestion, though the triggers of this response are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that an O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch stimulates postprandial cardiac enlargement in Burmese pythons. To test this hypothesis, we rendered animals anemic prior to feeding, essentially halving blood oxygen content during the postprandial period. Fed anemic animals had heart rates 126% higher than those of fasted controls, which, coupled with a 71% increase in mean arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, suggests fed anemic animals were experiencing significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated cardiac work. We found significant cardiac hypertrophy in fed anemic animals, which exhibited ventricles 39% larger than those of fasted controls and 28% larger than in fed controls. These findings support our hypothesis that those animals with a greater magnitude of O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch exhibit the largest hearts. The ‘low O<sub>2</sub> signal’ stimulating postprandial cardiac hypertrophy is likely mediated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated ventricular wall stress associated with postprandial hemodynamics.</p>

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hemodynamic variables such as cardiac index and right atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e have consistently been associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at the time of diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH. The prognostic importance of hemodynamic values achieved after treatment initiation is less well established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic importance of clinical and hemodynamic variables during follow-up, including pulmonary arterial compliance, after initial management in PAH. We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was death or lung transplantation. We used stepwise Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess variables obtained at baseline and at first follow-up RHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 981 patients, a primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (33.7%) over a median follow-up duration of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.6 years). In a multivariable model considering only baseline variables, no hemodynamic variables independently predicted prognosis. Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e were independently associated with death or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase.

0/1-Hour Triage Algorithm for Myocardial Infarction in Patients With Renal Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The European Society of Cardiology recommends a 0/1-hour algorithm for rapid rule-out and rule-in of non–ST-segment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentrations irrespective of renal function. Because patients with renal dysfunction (RD) frequently present with increased hs-cTn concentrations even in the absence of non–ST-segment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction, concern has been raised regarding the performance of the 0/1-hour algorithm in RD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter diagnostic study enrolling unselected patients presenting with suspected non–ST-segment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction to the emergency department, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in patients with RD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and compared it to patients with normal renal function. The final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists using all available information, including cardiac imaging. Safety was quantified as sensitivity in the rule-out zone, accuracy as the specificity in the rule-in zone, and efficacy as the proportion of the overall cohort assigned to either rule-out or rule-in based on the 0- and 1-hour sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3254 patients, RD was present in 487 patients (15%). The prevalence of non–ST-segment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction was substantially higher in patients with RD compared with patients with normal renal function (31% versus 13%, <i>P</i><0.001). Using hs-cTnT, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (100.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 97.6–100.0] versus 99.2% [95% CI, 97.6–99.8]; <i>P</i>=0.559), lower specificity of rule-in (88.7% [95% CI, 84.8–91.9] versus 96.5% [95% CI, 95.7–97.2]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (51% versus 81%, <i>P</i><0.001), mainly driven by a much lower percentage of patients eligible for rule-out (18% versus 68%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function.

Transcatheter Interatrial Shunt Device for the Treatment of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (REDUCE LAP-HF I [Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In nonrandomized, open-label studies, a transcatheter interatrial shunt device (IASD, Corvia Medical) was associated with lower pulmonary capillary wedge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (PCWP), fewer symptoms, and greater quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure (HF) and midrange or preserved ejection fraction (EF ≥40%). We conducted the first randomized sham-controlled trial to evaluate the IASD in HF with EF ≥40%.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REDUCE LAP-HF I (Reduce Elevated Left Atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in Patients With Heart Failure) was a phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, blinded multicenter trial in patients with New York Heart Association class III or ambulatory class IV HF, EF ≥40%, exercise PCWP ≥25 mm Hg, and PCWP-right atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e gradient ≥5 mm Hg. Participants were randomized (1:1) to the IASD versus a sham procedure (femoral venous access with intracardiac echocardiography but no IASD placement). The participants and investigators assessing the participants during follow-up were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary effectiveness end point was exercise PCWP at 1 month. The primary safety end point was major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal events at 1 month. PCWP during exercise was compared between treatment groups using a mixed-effects repeated measures model analysis of covariance that included data from all available stages of exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 94 patients were enrolled, of whom 44 met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were randomized to the IASD (n=22) and control (n=22) groups. Mean age was 70±9 years, and 50% were female. At 1 month, the IASD resulted in a greater reduction in PCWP compared with sham control (<i>P</i>=0.028 accounting for all stages of exercise). Peak PCWP decreased by 3.5±6.4 mm Hg in the treatment group versus 0.5±5.0 mm Hg in the control group (<i>P</i>=0.14). There were no peri-procedural or 1-month major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal events in the IASD group and 1 event (worsening renal function) in the control group (<i>P</i>=1.0).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with HF and EF ≥40%, IASD treatment reduces PCWP during exercise.

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, combined them into a genetic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other diseases. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were associated with coronary heart disease using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006). In a mediation analysis, the effect of the genetic score on decreased coronary heart disease risk extended beyond its effect on blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. Conversely, rare variants that inactivate the <i>NOS3</i> or <i>GUCY1A3</i> genes were associated with a 23 mm Hg higher systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (95% CI, 12-34; <i>P</i>=5.6*10<sup>–5</sup>) and a 3-fold higher risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.29-7.12; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling is associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke.

Association Between Diastolic Blood Pressure During Pediatric In-Hospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Survival
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>On the basis of laboratory cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) investigations and limited adult data demonstrating that survival depends on attaining adequate arterial diastolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (DBP) during CPR, the American Heart Association recommends using blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e to guide pediatric CPR. However, evidence-based blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e targets during pediatric CPR remain an important knowledge gap for CPR guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All children ≥37 weeks’ gestation and <19 years old in Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network intensive care units with chest compressions for ≥1 minute and invasive arterial blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e monitoring before and during CPR between July 1, 2013, and June 31, 2016, were included. Mean DBP during CPR and Utstein-style standardized cardiac arrest data were collected. The hypothesis was that DBP ≥25 mm Hg during CPR in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old would be associated with survival. Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurological outcome, defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Categories 1 to 3 or no worse than prearrest baseline. Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error estimates were used to estimate the relative risk of outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded investigators analyzed blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e waveforms during CPR from 164 children, including 60% <1 year old, 60% with congenital heart disease, and 54% after cardiac surgery. The immediate cause of arrest was hypotension in 67%, respiratory decompensation in 44%, and arrhythmia in 19%. Median duration of CPR was 8 minutes (quartiles, 3 and 27 minutes). Ninety percent survived the event, 68% with return of spontaneous circulation and 22% by extracorporeal life support. Forty-seven percent survived to hospital discharge, and 43% survived to discharge with favorable neurological outcome. Maintaining mean DBP ≥25 mm Hg in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old occurred in 101 of 164 children (62%) and was associated with survival (adjusted relative risk, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–2.6; <i>P</i>=0.007) and survival with favorable neurological outcome (adjusted relative risk, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–2.5; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data demonstrate that mean DBP ≥25 mm Hg during CPR in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old was associated with greater likelihood of survival to hospital discharge and survival with favorable neurological outcome.</p></sec>

J Curve in Patients Randomly Assigned to Different Systolic Blood Pressure Targets
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Low systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (SBP) values are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, giving rise to the so-called J-curve phenomenon. We assessed the association between on-treatment SBP levels, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in patients randomized to different SBP targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from 2 large randomized trials that randomly allocated hypertensive patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease to intensive (SBP<120 mm Hg) or conventional (SBP<140 mm Hg) treatment were pooled and harmonized for outcomes and follow-up duration. Using natural cubic splines, we plotted the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events against the mean on-treatment SBP per treatment group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The pooled data consisted of 194 875 on-treatment SBP measurements in 13 946 patients (98.9%). During a median follow-up of 3.3 years, cardiovascular events occurred in 1014 patients (7.3%), and 502 patients died (3.7%). For both blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e targets, an identical shape of the J curve was present, with a nadir for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality just below the SBP target. Patients in the lowest SBP stratum were older, had a higher body mass index, smoked more often, and had a higher frequency of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Low on-treatment SBP levels are associated with increased cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. This association is independent of the attained blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e level because the J curve aligns with the SBP target.

Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K Is Linked to Immunity and Inflammation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Immune dysregulation has been linked to occlusive vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is hereditary, idiopathic, or associated with other conditions. Circulating autoantibodies, lung perivascular lymphoid tissue, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated cytokines have been related to PAH pathogenesis but without a clear understanding of how these abnormalities are initiated, perpetuated, and connected in the progression of disease. We therefore set out to identify specific target antigens in PAH lung immune complexes as a starting point toward resolving these issues to better inform future application of immunomodulatory therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lung immune complexes were isolated and PAH target antigens were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and localized by confocal microscopy. One PAH antigen linked to immunity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured monocytes and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and lung studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate immune factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in immune complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control lungs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control lungs (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated in PAH versus control lungs (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating monocytes, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an interleukin 6-independent manner. Furthermore, 3 weekly injections of HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced hemodynamic and vascular changes of pulmonary hypertension in rats (n=8) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated interleukin 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study reveals that upregulation of the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K could both initiate and sustain activation of the immune system and cause vascular changes associated with PAH.</p></sec>

Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Lowering for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Among Men With Primary Elevations of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels of 190 mg/dL or Above
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥190 mg/dL are at a higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as a result of long-term exposure to markedly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated LDL-C levels. Therefore, initiation of statin therapy is recommended for these individuals. However, there is a lack of randomized trial evidence supporting these recommendations in primary prevention. In the present analysis, we provide hitherto unpublished data on the cardiovascular effects of LDL-C lowering among a primary prevention population with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We aimed to assess the benefits of LDL-C lowering on cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ations of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL without preexisting vascular disease at baseline. We performed post hoc analyses from the WOSCOPS (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study) randomized, placebo-controlled trial, and observational posttrial long-term follow-up, after excluding individuals with evidence of vascular disease at baseline. WOSCOPS enrolled 6595 men aged 45 to 64 years, who were randomly assigned to pravastatin 40 mg/d or placebo. In the present analyses, 5529 participants without evidence of vascular disease were included, stratified by LDL-C levels into those with LDL-C <190 mg/dL (n=2969; mean LDL-C 178±6 mg/dL) and those with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (n=2560; mean LDL-C 206±12 mg/dL).

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to characterize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be standardized to take account of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we evaluated the time course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-risk (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were performed: patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were evaluated at all time points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR examinations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference MaR was assessed by contrast-multidetector computed tomography during the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed models were used to take account of repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation time in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, edema extent measured by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to values measured by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR estimates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation MI edema highlight the need for standardization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a time window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for standardization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

Early Use of N-acetylcysteine With Nitrate Therapy in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Reduces Myocardial Infarct Size (the NACIAM Trial [N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction])

Association of Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Venous Thromboembolism

Definitions were harmonized across studies. Traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors were modeled categorically and continuously using restricted cubic splines. Estimates were obtained for overall VTE, provoked VTE (ie, VTE occurring in the presence of 1 or more established VTE risk factors), and unprovoked VTE, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The studies included 244 865 participants with 4910 VTE events occurring during a mean follow-up of 4.7 to 19.7 years per study. Age, sex, and body mass index-adjusted hazard ratios for overall VTE were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89−1.07) for hypertension, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88−1.08) for hyperlipidemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89−1.15) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08−1.32) for current smoking.

Pulmonary hyperinflation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may contribute to changes in intrathoracic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e that increase LV wall stress. We therefore hypothesized that residual lung volume in COPD would be associated with greater LV mass.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study recruited smokers 50 to 79 years of age who were free of clinical cardiovascular disease. LV mass was measured by cardiac magnetic resonance. Pulmonary function testing was performed according to guidelines. Regression models were used to adjust for age, sex, body size, blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, and other cardiac risk factors. Among 119 MESA COPD Study participants, the mean age was 69±6 years, 55% were male, and 65% had COPD, mostly of mild or moderate severity. Mean LV mass was 128±34 g. Residual lung volume was independently associated with greater LV mass (7.2 g per 1-SD increase in residual volume; 95% confidence interval, 2.2–12; <i>P</i>=0.004) and was similar in magnitude to that of systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (7.6 g per 1-SD increase in systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e; 95% confidence interval, 4.3–11; <i>P</i><0.001). Similar results were observed for the ratio of LV mass to end-diastolic volume (<i>P</i>=0.02) and with hyperinflation measured as residual volume to total lung capacity ratio (<i>P</i>=0.009).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Pulmonary hyperinflation, as measured by residual lung volume or residual lung volume to total lung capacity ratio, is associated with greater LV mass.</p></sec>

The Global Cardiovascular Risk Transition
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>It is commonly assumed that cardiovascular disease risk factors are associated with affluence and Westernization. We investigated the associations of body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, and serum total cholesterol with national income, Western diet, and, for BMI, urbanization in 1980 and 2008.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Country-level risk factor estimates for 199 countries between 1980 and 2008 were from a previous systematic analysis of population-based data. We analyzed the associations between risk factors and per capita national income, a measure of Western diet, and, for BMI, the percentage of the population living in urban areas. In 1980, there was a positive association between national income and population mean BMI, systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, and total cholesterol. By 2008, the slope of the association between national income and systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e became negative for women and zero for men. Total cholesterol was associated with national income and Western diet in both 1980 and 2008. In 1980, BMI rose with national income and then flattened at ≈Int$7000; by 2008, the relationship resembled an inverted U for women, peaking at middle-income levels. BMI had a positive relationship with the percentage of urban population in both 1980 and 2008. Fasting plasma glucose had weaker associations with these country macro characteristics, but it was positively associated with BMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The changing associations of metabolic risk factors with macroeconomic variables indicate that there will be a global pandemic of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, together with high blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in low-income countries, unless effective lifestyle and pharmacological interventions are implemented.</p></sec>

A Poly(A) Ribonuclease Controls the Cellotriose-Based Interaction between <i>Piriformospora indica</i> and Its Host Arabidopsis
<p><i>Piriformospora indica</i>, an endophytic root-colonizing fungus, efficiently promotes plant growth and induces resistance to abiotic stress and biotic diseases. <i>P. indica</i> fungal cell wall extract induces cytoplasmic calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation in host plant roots. Here, we show that cellotriose (CT) is an elicitor-active cell wall moiety released by <i>P. indica</i> into the medium. CT induces a mild defense-like response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, changes in membrane potential, and the expression of genes involved in growth regulation and root development. CT-based cytoplasmic calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots does not require the BAK1 coreceptor or the putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels TPC1, GLR3.3, GLR2.4, and GLR2.5 and operates synergistically with the elicitor chitin. We identified an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant (<i>cytoplasmic</i> <i>calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation mutant</i>) impaired in the response to CT and various other cellooligomers (<i>n</i> = 2–7), but not to chitooligomers (<i>n</i> = 4–8), in roots. The mutant contains a single nucleotide exchange in the gene encoding a poly(A) ribonuclease (AtPARN; At1g55870) that degrades the poly(A) tails of specific mRNAs. The wild-type <i>PARN</i> cDNA, expressed under the control of a 35S promoter, complements the mutant phenotype. Our identification of cellotriose as a novel chemical mediator casts light on the complex <i>P. indica</i>-plant mutualistic relationship.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation results from large strains in the jaw <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

The limits of applicability of the sound exposure level (SEL) metric to temporal threshold shifts (TTS) in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>The influence of fatiguing sound level and duration on post-exposure temporary threshold shift (TTS) was investigated in two beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The fatiguing sound was half-octave noise with a center frequency of 22.5 kHz. TTS was measured at a test frequency of 32 kHz. Thresholds were measured by recording rhythmic evoked potentials (the envelope following response) to a test series of short (eight cycles) tone pips with a pip rate of 1000 s<sup>−1</sup>. TTS increased approximately proportionally to the dB measure of both sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e level, SPL) and duration of the fatiguing noise, as a product of these two variables. In particular, when the noise parameters varied in a manner that maintained the product of squared sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e and time (sound exposure level, SEL, which is equivalent to the overall noise energy) at a constant level, TTS was not constant. Keeping SEL constant, the highest TTS appeared at an intermediate ratio of SPL to sound duration and decreased at both higher and lower ratios. Multiplication (SPL multiplied by log duration) better described the experimental data than an equal-energy (equal SEL) model. The use of SEL as a sole universal metric may result in an implausible assessment of the impact of a fatiguing sound on hearing thresholds in odontocetes, including under-evaluation of potential risks.</p>

Impact of Regionalization of ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Care on Treatment Times and Outcomes for Emergency Medical Services–Transported Patients Presenting to Hospitals With Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Regional variations in reperfusion times and mortality in patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction are influenced by differences in coordinating care between emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals. Building on the Accelerator-1 Project, we hypothesized that time to reperfusion could be further reduced with enhanced regional efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between April 2015 and March 2017, we worked with 12 metropolitan regions across the United States with 132 percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals and 946 EMS agencies. Data were collected in the ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network)-Get With The Guidelines Registry for quarterly Mission: Lifeline reports. The primary end point was the change in the proportion of EMS-transported patients with first medical contact to device time ≤90 minutes from baseline to final quarter. We also compared treatment times and mortality with patients treated in hospitals not participating in the project during the corresponding time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the study period, 10 730 patients were transported to percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals, including 974 in the baseline quarter and 972 in the final quarter who met inclusion criteria. Median age was 61 years; 27% were women, 6% had cardiac arrest, and 6% had shock on admission; 10% were black, 12% were Latino, and 10% were uninsured. By the end of the intervention, all process measures reflecting coordination between EMS and hospitals had improved, including the proportion of patients with a first medical contact to device time of ≤90 minutes (67%–74%; <i>P</i><0.002), a first medical contact to device time to catheterization laboratory activation of ≤20 minutes (38%–56%; <i>P</i><0.0001), and emergency department dwell time of ≤20 minutes (33%–43%; <i>P</i><0.0001). Of the 12 regions, 9 regions reduced first medical contact to device time, and 8 met or exceeded the national goal of 75% of patients treated in ≤90 minutes. Improvements in treatment times corresponded with a significant reduction in mortality (in-hospital death, 4.4%–2.3%; <i>P</i>=0.001) that was not apparent in hospitals not participating in the project during the same time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Organization of care among EMS and hospitals in 12 regions was associated with significant reductions in time to reperfusion in patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction as well as in in-hospital mortality.

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) target for mean arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between diffusion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6.

Inhibition of MicroRNA-146a and Overexpression of Its Target Dihydrolipoyl Succinyltransferase Protect Against Pressure Overload-Induced Cardiac Hypertrophy and Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases remain the predominant cause of death worldwide, with the prevalence of heart failure continuing to increase. Despite increased knowledge of the metabolic alterations that occur in heart failure, novel therapies to treat the observed metabolic disturbances are still lacking.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Mice were subjected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload by means of angiotensin-II infusion or transversal aortic constriction. MicroRNA-146a was either genetically or pharmacologically knocked out or genetically overexpressed in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, overexpression of dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (DLST) in the murine heart was performed by means of an adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MicroRNA-146a was upregulated in whole heart tissue in multiple murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload models. Also, microRNA-146a levels were moderately increased in left ventricular biopsies of patients with aortic stenosis. Overexpression of microRNA-146a in cardiomyocytes provoked cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction in vivo, whereas genetic knockdown or pharmacological blockade of microRNA-146a blunted the hypertrophic response and attenuated cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Mechanistically, microRNA-146a reduced its target DLST—the E2 subcomponent of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, a rate-controlling tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme. DLST protein levels significantly decreased on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload in wild-type mice, paralleling a decreased oxidative metabolism, whereas DLST protein levels and hence oxidative metabolism were partially maintained in microRNA-146a knockout mice. Moreover, overexpression of DLST in wild-type mice protected against cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Altogether we show that the microRNA-146a and its target DLST are important metabolic players in left ventricular dysfunction.</p></sec>

Evidence Supporting the Existence of a Distinct Obese Phenotype of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous syndrome. Phenotyping patients into pathophysiologically homogeneous groups may enable better targeting of treatment. Obesity is common in HFpEF and has many cardiovascular effects, suggesting that it may be a viable candidate for phenotyping. We compared cardiovascular structure, function, and reserve capacity in subjects with obese HFpEF, those with nonobese HFpEF, and control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Subjects with obese HFpEF (body mass index ≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; n=99), nonobese HFpEF (body mass index <30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; n=96), and nonobese control subjects free of HF (n=71) underwent detailed clinical assessment, echocardiography, and invasive hemodynamic exercise testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with both subjects with nonobese HFpEF and control subjects, subjects with obese HFpEF displayed increased plasma volume (3907 mL [3563–4333 mL] versus 2772 mL [2555–3133 mL], and 2680 mL [2380–3006 mL]; <i>P</i><0.0001), more concentric left ventricular remodeling, greater right ventricular dilatation (base, 34±7 versus 31±6 and 30±6 mm, <i>P</i>=0.0005; length, 66±7 versus 61±7 and 61±7 mm, <i>P</i><0.0001), more right ventricular dysfunction, increased epicardial fat thickness (10±2 versus 7±2 and 6±2 mm; <i>P</i><0.0001), and greater total epicardial heart volume (945 mL [831–1105 mL] versus 797 mL [643–979 mL] and 632 mL [517–768 mL]; <i>P</i><0.0001), despite lower N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Pulmonary capillary wedge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e was correlated with body mass and plasma volume in obese HFpEF (<i>r</i>=0.22 and 0.27, both <i>P</i><0.05) but not in nonobese HFpEF (<i>P</i>≥0.3). The increase in heart volumes in obese HFpEF was associated with greater pericardial restraint and heightened ventricular interdependence, reflected by increased ratio of right- to left-sided heart filling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es (0.64±0.17 versus 0.56±0.19 and 0.53±0.20; <i>P</i>=0.0004), higher pulmonary venous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e relative to left ventricular transmural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, and greater left ventricular eccentricity index (1.10±0.19 versus 0.99±0.06 and 0.97±0.12; <i>P</i><0.0001). Interdependence was enhanced as pulmonary artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e load increased (<i>P</i> for interaction <0.05). Compared with those with nonobese HFpEF and control subjects, obese patients with HFpEF displayed worse exercise capacity (peak oxygen consumption, 7.7±2.3 versus 10.0±3.4 and12.9±4.0 mL/min·kg; <i>P</i><0.0001), higher biventricular filling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es with exercise, and depressed pulmonary artery vasodilator reserve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Obesity-related HFpEF is a genuine form of cardiac failure and a clinically r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ant phenotype that may require specific treatments.</p></sec>

High-Resolution Mapping of Chromatin Conformation in Cardiac Myocytes Reveals Structural Remodeling of the Epigenome in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease is associated with epigenomic changes in the heart; however, the endogenous structure of cardiac myocyte chromatin has never been determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To investigate the mechanisms of epigenomic function in the heart, genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and DNA sequencing were performed in adult cardiac myocytes following development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload–induced hypertrophy. Mice with cardiac-specific deletion of CTCF (a ubiquitous chromatin structural protein) were generated to explore the role of this protein in chromatin structure and cardiac phenotype. Transcriptome analyses by RNA-seq were conducted as a functional readout of the epigenomic structural changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Depletion of CTCF was sufficient to induce heart failure in mice, and human patients with heart failure receiving mechanical unloading via left ventricular assist devices show increased CTCF abundance. Chromatin structural analyses revealed interactions within the cardiac myocyte genome at 5-kb resolution, enabling examination of intra- and interchromosomal events, and providing a resource for future cardiac epigenomic investigations. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload or CTCF depletion selectively altered boundary strength between topologically associating domains and A/B compartmentalization, measurements of genome accessibility. Heart failure involved decreased stability of chromatin interactions around disease-causing genes. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload or CTCF depletion remodeled long-range interactions of cardiac enhancers, resulting in a significant decrease in local chromatin interactions around these functional elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings provide a high-resolution chromatin architecture resource for cardiac epigenomic investigations and demonstrate that global structural remodeling of chromatin underpins heart failure. The newly identified principles of endogenous chromatin structure have key implications for epigenetic therapy.</p></sec>

Vitamin E diffused highly cross-linked polyethylene in total hip arthroplasty at five years
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The objective of this five-year prospective, blinded, randomised   controlled trial (RCT) was to compare femoral head penetration into   a vitamin E diffused highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) liner   with penetration into a medium cross-linked polyethylene control   liner using radiostereometric analysis. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">schedul</span></strong>ed for total hip arthroplasty (THA) were randomised   to receive either the study E1 (32 patients) or the control ArComXL   polyethylene (35 patients). The median age (range) of the overall   cohort was 66 years (40 to 76).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The five-year median (interquartile range) proximal femoral head   penetration into the E1 was -0.05 mm (-0.13 to -0.02) and 0.07 mm   (-0.03 to 0.16) for ArComXL. At three and five years, the penetration   was significantly greater in the ArComXL group compared with the   E1 group (p = 0.029 and p = 0.019, respectively). All patient-reported outcomes   (PROs) improved significantly from the pre-operative interval compared   with those at one year, and remained favourable at five years. There   were no differences between the two groups at any interval.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The five-year results showed that E1 polyethylene does not wear   more than the control, ArComXL. This is the longest-term RCT comparing   the wear performance and clinical outcome of vitamin E diffused   HXLPE with a previous generation of medium cross-linked polyethylene.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:577–84. </p></sec>

Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic in total knee arthroplasty; is posterior capsular infiltration worth the risk?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic provides effective   control of pain in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).   There is little information about the added benefits of posterior   capsular infiltration (PCI) using different combinations of local   anaesthetic agents. Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness   of the control of pain using multimodal infiltration with and without   infiltration of the posterior capsule of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial of patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">schedul</span></strong>ed   for unilateral primary TKA, 86 were assigned to be treated with   multimodal infiltration with (Group I) or without (Group II) PCI.   Routine associated analgesia included the use of bupivacaine, morphine,   ketorolac and epinephrine. All patients had spinal anaesthesia and patient-controlled   analgesia (PCA) post-operatively. A visual analogue scale (VAS)   for pain and the use of morphine were recorded 24 hours post-operatively.   Side effects of the infiltration, blood loss, and length of stay   in hospital were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no statistically significant differences between the   groups in relation to: VAS pain scores in the first 24 hours post-operatively   (p = 0.693), the use of morphine in the PCA (p = 0.647), blood loss   (p = 0.625), and length of stay (p = 0.17). There were no neurovascular   complications in either group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic with infiltration   of the posterior capsule did not provide significant added analgesic   benefits or reduce the use of morphine after TKA. Multimodal infiltration   is a satisfactory technique for the management of pain in these   patients without the attendant risks of PCI.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017; 99-B:483–8.</p></sec>

Pre-operative functional mobility as an independent determinant of inpatient functional recovery after total knee arthroplasty during three periods that coincided with changes in clinical pathways
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>To investigate whether pre-operative functional mobility is a   determinant of delayed inpatient recovery of activities (IRoA) after   total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in three periods that coincided with   changes in the clinical pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients (n = 682, 73% women, mean age 70 years, standard   deviation 9) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">schedul</span></strong>ed for TKA between 2009 and 2015 were pre-operatively   screened for functional mobility by the Timed-up-and-Go test (TUG)   and De Morton mobility index (DEMMI). The cut-off point for delayed   IRoA was set on the day that 70% of the patients were recovered,   according to the Modified Iowa Levels of Assistance Scale (mILAS)   (a 5-item activity scale). In a multivariable logistic regression   analysis, we added either the TUG or the DEMMI to a reference model   including established determinants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both the TUG (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.10 per second, 95% confidence   intervals (CI) 1.06 to 1.15) and the DEMMI (OR 0.96 per point on   the 100-point scale, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.98) were statistically significant   determinants of delayed IRoA in a model that also included age,   BMI, ASA score and ISAR score. These associations did not depend   on the time period during which the TKA took place, as assessed   by tests for interaction. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Functional mobility, as assessed pre-operatively by the TUG and   DEMMI, is an independent and stable determinant of delayed inpatient   recovery of activities after TKA. Future research, focusing on improvement   of pre-operative functional mobility through tailored physiotherapy   intervention, should indicate whether such intervention enhances   post-operative recovery among high-risk patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:211–17.</p></sec>

The effect of a single early high-dose vitamin D supplement on fracture union in patients with hypovitaminosis D
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the effect of a single early high-dose vitamin D   supplement on fracture union in patients with hypovitaminosis D   and a long bone fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between July 2011 and August 2013, 113 adults with a long bone   fracture were enrolled in a prospective randomised double-blind   placebo-controlled trial. Their serum vitamin D levels were measured   and a total of 100 patients were found to be vitamin D deficient   (< 20 ng/ml) or insufficient (< 30 ng/mL). These were then   randomised to receive a single dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> orally   (100 000 IU) within two weeks of injury (treatment group, n = 50)   or a placebo (control group, n = 50). We recorded patient demographics,   fracture location and treatment, vitamin D level, time to fracture   union and complications, including vitamin D toxicity.</p><p>Outcomes included union, nonunion or complication requiring an   early, unplanned secondary procedure. Patients without an outcome   at 15 months and no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">schedul</span></strong>ed follow-up were considered lost to   follow-up. The <i>t</i>-test and cross tabulations verified   the adequacy of randomisation. An intention-to-treat analysis was   carried out.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 100 (89%) patients had hypovitaminosis D. Both treatment   and control groups had similar demographics and injury characteristics.   The initial median vitamin D levels were 16 ng/mL (interquartile   range 5 to 28) in both groups (p = 0.885). A total of 14 patients   were lost to follow-up (seven from each group), two had fixation   failure (one in each group) and one control group patient developed   an infection. Overall, the nonunion rate was 4% (two per group).   No patient showed signs of clinical toxicity from their supplement.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite finding a high level of hypovitaminosis D, the rate of   union was high and independent of supplementation with vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1520–5.</p></sec>

Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion using polyetheretherketone oblique cages with and without a titanium coating
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We compared the clinical and radiological outcomes of using a   polyetheretherketone cage with (TiPEEK) and without a titanium coating   (PEEK) for instrumented transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We conducted a randomised clinical pilot trial of 40 patients   who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">schedul</span></strong>ed to undergo a TLIF procedure at one or two levels   between L2 and L5. The Oswestry disability index (ODI), EuroQoL-5D,   and back and leg pain were determined pre-operatively, and at three,   six, and 12 months post-operatively. Fusion rates were assessed   by thin slice CT at three months and by functional radiography at   12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At final follow-up, one patient in each group had been lost to   follow-up. Two patients in each of the PEEK and TiPEEK groups were   revised for pseudarthrosis (p = 1.00). The rate of complete or partial   fusion at three months was 91.7% in both groups. Overall, there   were no significant differences in ODI or in radiological outcomes   between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Favourable results with identical clinical outcomes and a high   rate of fusion was seen in both groups. The titanium coating appears   to have no negative effects on outcome or safety in the short term.

Timing of Angiography and Outcomes in High-Risk Patients With Non–ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Managed Invasively
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In patients with non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) score >140, coronary angiography (CAG) is recommended by European and American guidelines within 24 hours. We sought to study the association of very early (ie, ≤12 hours), early (12–24 hours), and delayed (>24 hours) CAG in patients with NSTEMI with GRACE score >140 with ischemic outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The TAO trial (Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome With Otamixaban) randomized patients with NSTEMI and CAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">schedul</span></strong>ed within 72 hours to heparin plus eptifibatide versus otamixaban. In this post hoc analysis, patients with a GRACE score >140 were categorized into 3 groups according to timing of CAG from admission (<12, ≥12–<24, and ≥24 hours). The primary ischemic outcome was the composite of all-cause death and myocardial infarction within 180 days of randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CAG was performed in 4071 patients (<12 hours, n=1648 [40.5%]; 12–24 hours, n=1420 [34.9%]; ≥24 hours, n=1003 [24.6%]). With CAG ≥24 hours as a reference, CAG from 12 to 24 hours was not associated with a lower risk of primary ischemic outcome at 180 days (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–1.23), whereas CAG <12 hours was associated with a lower risk of death and myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.55–0.91). Performing CAG <12 hours was also associated with a lower risk of death and myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.01) compared with CAG performed at 12 to 24 hours. No difference was observed in bleeding complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with high-risk NSTEMI, undergoing CAG within the initial 12 hours after admission (as opposed to later, either 12–24 or ≥24 hours) was associated with lower risk of ischemic outcomes at 180 days.</p></sec>

Brain Emboli After Left Ventricular Endocardial Ablation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) is common. Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation is associated with a risk of cerebral emboli attributed to cardioversions and numerous ablation lesions in the low-flow left atrium, but cerebral embolic risk in ventricular ablation has not been evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We enrolled 18 consecutive patients meeting study criteria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">schedul</span></strong>ed for ventricular tachycardia or PVC ablation over a 9-month period. Patients undergoing left ventricular (LV) ablation were compared with a control group of those undergoing right ventricular ablation only. Patients were excluded if they had implantable cardioverter defibrillators or permanent pacemakers. Radiofrequency energy was used for ablation in all cases and heparin was administered with goal-activated clotting times of 300 to 400 seconds for all LV procedures. Pre- and postprocedural brain MRI was performed on each patient within a week of the ablation procedure. Embolic infarcts were defined as new foci of reduced diffusion and high signal intensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain MRI within a vascular distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 58 years, half of the patients were men, half had a history of hypertension, and the majority had no known vascular disease or heart failure. LV ablation was performed in 12 patients (ventricular tachycardia, n=2; PVC, n=10) and right ventricular ablation was performed exclusively in 6 patients (ventricular tachycardia, n=1; PVC, n=5). Seven patients (58%) undergoing LV ablation experienced a total of 16 cerebral emboli, in comparison with zero patients undergoing right ventricular ablation (<i>P</i>=0.04). Seven of 11 patients (63%) undergoing a retrograde approach to the LV developed at least 1 new brain lesion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>More than half of patients undergoing routine LV ablation procedures (predominately PVC ablations) experienced new brain emboli after the procedure. Future research is critical to understanding the long-term consequences of these lesions and to determining optimal strategies to avoid them.</p></sec>

Thoracic Epidural Anesthesia Reduces Right Ventricular Systolic Function With Maintained Ventricular-Pulmonary Coupling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Blockade of cardiac sympathetic fibers by thoracic epidural anesthesia may affect right ventricular function and interfere with the coupling between right ventricular function and right ventricular afterload. Our main objectives were to study the effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia on right ventricular function and ventricular-pulmonary coupling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 10 patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">schedul</span></strong>ed for lung resection, right ventricular function and its response to increased afterload, induced by temporary, unilateral clamping of the pulmonary artery, was tested before and after induction of thoracic epidural anesthesia using combined pressure-conductance catheters.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Thoracic epidural anesthesia resulted in a significant decrease in right ventricular contractility (ΔESV<sub>25</sub>: +25.5 mL, <i>P</i>=0.0003; ΔEes: -0.025 mm Hg/mL, <i>P</i>=0.04). Stroke work, dP/dt<sub>MAX</sub>, and ejection fraction showed a similar decrease in systolic function (all <i>P</i><0.05). A concomitant decrease in effective arterial elastance (ΔEa: -0.094 mm Hg/mL, <i>P</i>=0.004) yielded unchanged ventricular-pulmonary coupling. Cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and mean arterial blood pressure were unchanged. Clamping of the pulmonary artery significantly increased afterload (ΔEa: +0.226 mm Hg/mL, <i>P</i><0.001). In response, right ventricular contractility increased (ΔESV<sub>25</sub>: -26.6 mL, <i>P</i>=0.0002; ΔEes: +0.034 mm Hg/mL, <i>P</i>=0.008), but ventricular-pulmonary coupling decreased (Δ(Ees/Ea) = -0.153, <i>P</i><0.0001). None of the measured indices showed significant interactive effects, indicating that the effects of increased afterload were the same before and after thoracic epidural anesthesia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Thoracic epidural anesthesia impairs right ventricular contractility but does not inhibit the native positive inotropic response of the right ventricle to increased afterload. Right ventricular-pulmonary arterial coupling was decreased with increased afterload but not affected by the induction of thoracic epidural anesthesia.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2844</ext-link>.

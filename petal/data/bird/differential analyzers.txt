0/1-Hour Triage Algorithm for Myocardial Infarction in Patients With Renal Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The European Society of Cardiology recommends a 0/1-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> for rapid rule-out and rule-in of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentrations irrespective of renal function. Because patients with renal dysfunction (RD) frequently present with increased hs-cTn concentrations even in the absence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, concern has been raised regarding the performance of the 0/1-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> in RD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter diagnostic study enrolling unselected patients presenting with suspected non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to the emergency department, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in patients with RD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and compared it to patients with normal renal function. The final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists using all available information, including cardiac imaging. Safety was quantified as sensitivity in the rule-out zone, accuracy as the specificity in the rule-in zone, and efficacy as the proportion of the overall cohort assigned to either rule-out or rule-in based on the 0- and 1-hour sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3254 patients, RD was present in 487 patients (15%). The prevalence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was substantially higher in patients with RD compared with patients with normal renal function (31% versus 13%, <i>P</i><0.001). Using hs-cTnT, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (100.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 97.6–100.0] versus 99.2% [95% CI, 97.6–99.8]; <i>P</i>=0.559), lower specificity of rule-in (88.7% [95% CI, 84.8–91.9] versus 96.5% [95% CI, 95.7–97.2]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (51% versus 81%, <i>P</i><0.001), mainly driven by a much lower percentage of patients eligible for rule-out (18% versus 68%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function. Using hs-cTnI, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (98.6% [95% CI, 95.0–99.8] versus 98.5% [95% CI, 96.5–99.5]; <i>P</i>=1.0), lower specificity of rule-in (84.4% [95% CI, 79.9–88.3] versus 91.7% [95% CI, 90.5–92.9]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (54% versus 76%, <i>P</i><0.001; proportion ruled out, 18% versus 58%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with RD, the safety of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> is high, but specificity of rule-in and overall efficacy are decreased.

Point-of-Care Hemostatic Testing in Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac surgery is frequently complicated by coagulopathic bleeding that is difficult to optimally manage using standard hemostatic testing. We hypothesized that point-of-care hemostatic testing within the context of an integrated transfusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> would improve the management of coagulopathy in cardiac surgery and thereby reduce blood transfusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a pragmatic multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial of a point-of-care–based transfusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> in consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 12 hospitals from October 6, 2014, to May 1, 2015. Following a 1-month data collection at all participating hospitals, a transfusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> incorporating point-of-care hemostatic testing was sequentially implemented at 2 hospitals at a time in 1-month intervals, with the implementation order randomly assigned. No other aspects of care were modified. The primary outcome was red blood cell transfusion from surgery to postoperative day 7. Other outcomes included transfusion of other blood products, major bleeding, and major complications. The analysis adjusted for secular time trends, within-hospital clustering, and patient-level risk factors. All outcomes and analyses were prespecified before study initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 7402 patients studied, 3555 underwent surgery during the control phase and 3847 during the intervention phase. Overall, 3329 (45.0%) received red blood cells, 1863 (25.2%) received platelets, 1645 (22.2%) received plasma, and 394 (5.3%) received cryoprecipitate. Major bleeding occurred in 1773 (24.1%) patients, and major complications occurred in 740 (10.2%) patients. The trial intervention reduced rates of red blood cell transfusion (adjusted relative risk, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.02; number needed to treat, 24.7), platelet transfusion (relative risk, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.87; <i>P</i><0.001; number needed to treat, 16.7), and major bleeding (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.004; number needed to treat, 22.6), but had no effect on other blood product transfusions or major complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of point-of-care hemostatic testing within the context of an integrated transfusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> reduces red blood cell transfusions, platelet transfusions, and major bleeding following cardiac surgery.

Superhuman AI for heads-up no-limit poker: Libratus beats top professionals

Improving refugee integration through data-driven algorithmic assignment
<p>Developed democracies are settling an increased number of refugees, many of whom face challenges integrating into host societies. We developed a flexible data-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> that assigns refugees across resettlement locations to improve integration outcomes. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> uses a combination of supervised machine learning and optimal matching to discover and leverage synergies between refugee characteristics and resettlement sites. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> was tested on historical registry data from two countries with different assignment regimes and refugee populations, the United States and Switzerland. Our approach led to gains of roughly 40 to 70%, on average, in refugees’ employment outcomes relative to current assignment practices. This approach can provide governments with a practical and cost-efficient policy tool that can be immediately implemented within existing institutional structures.</p>

A neural algorithm for a fundamental computing problem
<p>Similarity search—for example, identifying similar images in a database or similar documents on the web—is a fundamental computing problem faced by large-scale information retrieval systems. We discovered that the fruit fly olfactory circuit solves this problem with a variant of a computer science <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> (called locality-sensitive hashing). The fly circuit assigns similar neural activity patterns to similar odors, so that behaviors learned from one odor can be applied when a similar odor is experienced. The fly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>, however, uses three computational strategies that depart from traditional approaches. These strategies can be translated to improve the performance of computational similarity searches. This perspective helps illuminate the logic supporting an important sensory function and provides a conceptually new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> for solving a fundamental computational problem.</p>

Resolving Ambiguity of Species Limits and Concatenation in Multilocus Sequence Data for the Construction of Phylogenetic Supermatrices
<p>Public DNA databases are becoming too large and too complex for manual methods to generate phylogenetic supermatrices from multiple gene sequences. Delineating the terminals based on taxonomic labels is no longer practical because species identifications are frequently incomplete and gene trees are incongruent with Linnaean binomials, which results in uncertainty about how to combine species units among unlinked loci. We developed a procedure that minimizes the problem of forming multilocus species units in a large phylogenetic data set using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>s from graph theory. An initial step established sequence clusters for each locus that broadly correspond to the species level. These clusters frequently include sequences labeled with various binomials and specimen identifiers that create multiple alternatives for concatenation. To choose among these possibilities, we minimize taxonomic conflict among the species units globally in the data set using a multipartite heuristic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>. The procedure was applied to all available GenBank data for Coleoptera (beetles) including > 10 500 taxon labels and > 23 500 sequences of 4 loci, which were grouped into 11 241 clusters or divergent singletons by the BlastClust software. Within each cluster, unidentified sequences could be assigned to a species name through the association with fully identified sequences, resulting in 510 new identifications (13.9% of total unidentified sequences) of which nearly half were “trans-locus” identifications by clustering of sequences at a secondary locus. The limits of DNA-based clusters were inconsistent with the Linnaean binomials for 1518 clusters (13.5%) that contained more than one binomial or split a single binomial among multiple clusters. By applying a scoring scheme for full and partial name matches in pairs of clusters, a maximum weight set of 7366 global species units was produced. Varying the match weights for partial matches had little effect on the number of units, although if partial matches were disallowed, the number increased greatly. Trees from the resulting supermatrices generally produced tree topologies in good agreement with the higher taxonomy of Coleoptera, with fewer terminals compared with trees generated according to standard filtering of sequences using species labels. The study illustrates a strategy for assembling the tree-of-life from an ever more complex primary database.

Designing river flows to improve food security futures in the Lower Mekong Basin
<p>Rivers provide unrivaled opportunity for clean energy via hydropower, but little is known about the potential impact of dam-building on the food security these rivers provide. In tropical rivers, rainfall drives a periodic flood pulse fueling fish production and delivering nutrition to more than 150 million people worldwide. Hydropower will modulate this flood pulse, thereby threatening food security. We identified variance components of the Mekong River flood pulse that predict yield in one of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world. We used these variance components to design an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> for a managed hydrograph to explore future yields. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> mimics attributes of discharge variance that drive fishery yield: prolonged low flows followed by a short flood pulse. Designed flows increased yield by a factor of 3.7 relative to historical hydrology. Managing desired components of discharge variance will lead to greater efficiency in the Lower Mekong Basin food system.</p>

A cargo-sorting DNA robot
<p>Two critical challenges in the design and synthesis of molecular robots are modularity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> simplicity. We demonstrate three modular building blocks for a DNA robot that performs cargo sorting at the molecular level. A simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> encoding recognition between cargos and their destinations allows for a simple robot design: a single-stranded DNA with one leg and two foot domains for walking, and one arm and one hand domain for picking up and dropping off cargos. The robot explores a two-dimensional testing ground on the surface of DNA origami, picks up multiple cargos of two types that are initially at unordered locations, and delivers them to specified destinations until all molecules are sorted into two distinct piles. The robot is designed to perform a random walk without any energy supply. Exploiting this feature, a single robot can repeatedly sort multiple cargos. Localization on DNA origami allows for distinct cargo-sorting tasks to take place simultaneously in one test tube or for multiple robots to collectively perform the same task.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Value of Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification for Risk Prediction of Coronary and Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Computed tomography (CT) allows estimation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. We evaluated several progression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>s in our unselected, population-based cohort for risk prediction of coronary and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 3281 participants (45–74 years of age), free from cardiovascular disease until the second visit, risk factors, and CTs at baseline (b) and after a mean of 5.1 years (5y) were measured. Hard coronary and cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events including revascularization, as well, were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8±2.2 years after the second CT. The added predictive value of 10 CAC progression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>s on top of risk factors including baseline CAC was evaluated by using survival analysis, C-statistics, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination index. A subgroup analysis of risk in CAC categories was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed 85 (2.6%) hard coronary, 161 (4.9%) hard cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for hard/total cardiovascular events). Some progression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>s added to the predictive value of baseline CT and risk assessment in terms of C-statistic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not improve models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year risk factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and hard/total cardiovascular risk: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively. When CAC<sub>b</sub> progressed from 1 to 399 to CAC<sub>5y</sub>≥400, coronary and total cardiovascular risk were nearly 2-fold in comparison with subjects who remained below CAC<sub>5y</sub>=400. Participants with CAC<sub>b</sub>≥400 had high rates of hard coronary and hard/total cardiovascular events (10-year risk: 12.0%, 13.5%, and 30.9%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CAC progression is associated with coronary and cardiovascular event rates, but adds only weakly to risk prediction. What counts is the most recent CAC value and risk factor assessment. Therefore, a repeat scan >5 years after the first scan may be of additional value, except when a double-zero CT scan is present or when the subjects are already at high risk.</p></sec>

Invertible promoters mediate bacterial phase variation, antibiotic resistance, and host adaptation in the gut
<p>Phase variation, the reversible alternation between genetic states, enables infection by pathogens and colonization by commensals. However, the diversity of phase variation remains underexplored. We developed the PhaseFinder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> to quantify DNA inversion–mediated phase variation. A systematic search of 54,875 bacterial genomes identified 4686 intergenic invertible DNA regions (invertons), revealing an enrichment in host-associated bacteria. Invertons containing promoters often regulate extracellular products, underscoring the importance of surface diversity for gut colonization. We found invertons containing promoters regulating antibiotic resistance genes that shift to the ON orientation after antibiotic treatment in human metagenomic data and in vitro, thereby mitigating the cost of antibiotic resistance. We observed that the orientations of some invertons diverge after fecal microbiota transplant, potentially as a result of individual-specific selective forces.</p>

In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess), as well as Go.</p>

Sources of human viruses

Many of these that are newly found in humans have a natural mammal or bird reservoir; some are transmitted by arthropod vectors, such as mosquitos (<i>2</i>). If we do not know the reservoir host and/or vector, it is harder to identify individuals and populations at greatest risk of infection and to design an effective public health response.

Three-dimensional genome structures of single diploid human cells
<p>Three-dimensional genome structures play a key role in gene regulation and cell functions. Characterization of genome structures necessitates single-cell measurements. This has been achieved for haploid cells but has remained a challenge for diploid cells. We developed a single-cell chromatin conformation capture method, termed Dip-C, that combines a transposon-based whole-genome amplification method to detect many chromatin contacts, called META (multiplex end-tagging amplification), and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> to impute the two chromosome haplotypes linked by each contact. We reconstructed the genome structures of single diploid human cells from a lymphoblastoid cell line and from primary blood cells with high spatial resolution, locating specific single-nucleotide and copy number variations in the nucleus. The two alleles of imprinted loci and the two X chromosomes were structurally different. Cells of different types displayed statistically distinct genome structures. Such structural cell typing is crucial for understanding cell functions.</p>

Predicting reaction performance in C–N cross-coupling using machine learning
<p>Machine learning methods are becoming integral to scientific inquiry in numerous disciplines. We demonstrated that machine learning can be used to predict the performance of a synthetic reaction in multidimensional chemical space using data obtained via high-throughput experimentation. We created scripts to compute and extract atomic, molecular, and vibrational descriptors for the components of a palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling of aryl halides with 4-methylaniline in the presence of various potentially inhibitory additives. Using these descriptors as inputs and reaction yield as output, we showed that a random forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> provides significantly improved predictive performance over linear regression analysis. The random forest model was also successfully applied to sparse training sets and out-of-sample prediction, suggesting its value in facilitating adoption of synthetic methodology.</p>

<p>Single-qubit rotations and two-qubit CNOT operations are crucial ingredients for universal quantum computing. Although high-fidelity single-qubit operations have been achieved using the electron spin degree of freedom, realizing a robust CNOT gate has been challenging because of rapid nuclear spin dephasing and charge noise. We demonstrate an efficient resonantly driven CNOT gate for electron spins in silicon. Our platform achieves single-qubit rotations with fidelities greater than 99%, as verified by randomized benchmarking. Gate control of the exchange coupling allows a quantum CNOT gate to be implemented with resonant driving in ~200 nanoseconds. We used the CNOT gate to generate a Bell state with 78% fidelity (corrected for errors in state preparation and measurement). Our quantum dot device architecture enables multi-qubit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>s in silicon.</p>

Bot-hunters eye mischief in German election
<p>With Germans going to the polls on 24 September to elect their new parliament, experts are watching closely for signs of automated propaganda on social networks. So far, bots—fake social media profiles that appear to be human users but are really driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>s—seem less active than they did in the recent presidential elections in France and the United States, where some commentators believe Russia was seeking to boost right-wing candidates. But researchers sensitized by past elections are making the German contest a laboratory for studies of how to recognize bots and trace their effects. Teams are trawling tens of millions of tweets related to the German elections for signs that bots are exerting influence.</p>

DeepStack: Expert-level artificial intelligence in heads-up no-limit poker
<p>Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that players have perfect information. Poker, the quintessential game of imperfect information, is a long-standing challenge problem in artificial intelligence. We introduce DeepStack, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> for imperfect-information settings. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition that is automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack defeated, with statistical significance, professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em. The approach is theoretically sound and is shown to produce strategies that are more difficult to exploit than prior approaches.</p>

Predicting human olfactory perception from chemical features of odor molecules
<p>It is still not possible to predict whether a given molecule will have a perceived odor or what olfactory percept it will produce. We therefore organized the crowd-sourced DREAM Olfaction Prediction Challenge. Using a large olfactory psychophysical data set, teams developed machine-learning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>s to predict sensory attributes of molecules based on their chemoinformatic features. The resulting models accurately predicted odor intensity and pleasantness and also successfully predicted 8 among 19 rated semantic descriptors (“garlic,” “fish,” “sweet,” “fruit,” “burnt,” “spices,” “flower,” and “sour”). Regularized linear models performed nearly as well as random forest–based ones, with a predictive accuracy that closely approaches a key theoretical limit. These models help to predict the perceptual qualities of virtually any molecule with high accuracy and also reverse-engineer the smell of a molecule.</p>

Characterization and Cloning of Grape Circular RNAs Identified the Cold Resistance-Related <i>Vv-circATS1</i>
<p>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely distributed and play essential roles in a series of developmental processes, although none have been identified or characterized in grapevines (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>). In this study, we characterized the function of grape circRNA and uncovered thousands of putative back-splicing sites by global transcriptome analysis. Our results indicated that several reported circRNA prediction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>s should be used simultaneously to obtain comprehensive and reliable circRNA predictions in plants. Furthermore, the length of introns flanking grape circRNAs was closely related to exon circularization. Although the longer introns flanking grape circRNAs appeared to circularize more efficiently, a 20- to 50-nt region seemed large enough to drive grape circRNA biogenesis. In addition, the endogenous introns flanking circularized exon(s) in conjunction with reverse complementary sequences could support the accurate and efficient circularization of various exons in grape, which constitutes a new tool for exploring the functional consequences caused by circRNA expression. Finally, we identified 475 differentially expressed circRNAs in grape leaves under cold stress. Overexpression of <i>Vv-circATS1</i>, a circRNA derived from <i>glycerol-3-P acyltransferase</i>, improved cold tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), while the linear RNA derived from the same sequence cannot. These results indicate the functional difference between circRNA and linear RNA, and provide new insight into plant abiotic stress resistance.</p>

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-genome sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the environment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and environment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or averaged across individuals. Therefore, computational methods are used to reconstruct representative prototypes using a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>s for filling in missing information and calculating means. The same problem applies to the root system architecture (RSA) of plants. Several computer programs are available for extracting numerical data from root images, but they usually do not offer customized data analysis or visual reconstruction of RSA. We developed Root-VIS, a free software tool that facilitates the determination of means and variance of many different RSA features across user-selected sets of root images. Furthermore, Root-VIS offers several options to generate visual reconstructions of root systems from the averaged data to enable screening and modeling. We confirmed the suitability of Root-VIS, combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo, for the rapid characterization of genotype-environment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

TransDetect Identifies a New Regulatory Module Controlling Phosphate Accumulation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Identifying transcription factor (TFs) cooperation controlling target gene expression is still an arduous challenge. The accuracy of current methods at genome scale significantly drops with the increase in number of genes, which limits their applicability to more complex genomes, like animals and plants. Here, we developed an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>, TransDetect, able to predict TF combinations controlling the expression level of a given gene. TransDetect was used to identify novel TF modules regulating the expression of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) phosphate transporter <i>PHO1;H3</i> comprising MYB15, MYB84, bHLH35, and ICE1. These TFs were confirmed to interact between themselves and with the <i>PHO1;H3</i> promoter. Phenotypic and genetic analyses of TF mutants enable the organization of these four TFs and <i>PHO1;H3</i> in a new gene regulatory network controlling phosphate accumulation in zinc-dependent manner. This demonstrates the potential of TransDetect to extract directionality in nondynamic transcriptomes and to provide a blueprint to identify gene regulatory network involved in a given biological process.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>s were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-based Plant Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated genes (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many phenotypes, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as genomic neighborhoods containing several gene duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to gene number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of genomic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical distribution of individual members of families of duplicated genes across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many well-known gene clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin gene clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian genomes. Differences between previously annotated gene clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific gene clusters, the inclusion or absence of genes between the CTDGs and their corresponding gene clusters, and the splitting of certain gene clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human genes showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several well-known gene clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.</p>

The Developmental Brain Gene <i>NPAS3</i> Contains the Largest Number of Accelerated Regulatory Sequences in the Human Genome
<p>To identify the evolutionary genetic novelties that contributed to shape human-specific traits such as the use of a complex language, long-term planning and exceptional learning abilities is one of the ultimate frontiers of modern biology. Evolutionary signatures of functional shifts could be detected by comparing noncoding regions that are highly conserved across mammals or primates and rapidly accumulated nucleotide substitutions only in the lineage leading to humans. As gene loci densely populated with human-accelerated elements (HAEs) are more likely to have contributed to human-specific novelties, we sought to identify the transcriptional units and genomic 1 Mb intervals of the entire human genome carrying the highest number of HAEs. To this end, we took advantage of four available data sets of human genomic accelerated regions obtained through different comparisons and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>s and performed a meta-analysis of the combined data. We found that the brain developmental transcription factor <i>neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3</i> (<i>NPAS3</i>) contains the largest cluster of noncoding-accelerated regions in the human genome with up to 14 elements that are highly conserved in mammals, including primates, but carry human-specific nucleotide substitutions. We then tested the ability of the 14 HAEs identified at the <i>NPAS3</i> locus to act as transcriptional regulatory sequences in a reporter expression assay performed in transgenic zebrafish. We found that 11 out of the 14 HAEs present in <i>NPAS3</i> act as transcriptional enhancers during development, particularly within the nervous system. As <i>NPAS3</i> is known to play a crucial role during mammalian brain development, our results indicate that the high density of HAEs present in the human <i>NPAS3</i> locus could have modified the spatiotemporal expression pattern of <i>NPAS3</i> in the developing human brain and, therefore, contributed to human brain evolution.</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural selection, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural selection on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. It obtains information about divergence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and divergence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.</p>

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Frequencies of Known Haplotypes from Pooled Sequence Data
<p>DNA samples are often pooled, either by experimental design or because the sample itself is a mixture. For example, when population allele frequencies are of primary interest, individual samples may be pooled together to lower the cost of sequencing. Alternatively, the sample itself may be a mixture of multiple species or strains (e.g., bacterial species comprising a microbiome or pathogen strains in a blood sample). We present an expectation–maximization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> for estimating haplotype frequencies in a pooled sample directly from mapped sequence reads, in the case where the possible haplotypes are known. This method is relevant to the analysis of pooled sequencing data from selection experiments, as well as the calculation of proportions of different species within a metagenomics sample. Our method outperforms existing methods based on single-site allele frequencies, as well as simple approaches using sequence read data. We have implemented the method in a freely available open-source software tool.</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>s: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from <ext-link>www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>.</p>

The mean follow-up was 10.3 years (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 years (3.0   to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 years (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at diagnosis for OFD was 13.5 years (1 to 49), 10.5   years (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 years (14 to 86) for adamantinoma.   A total of 24 of the 42 patients with OFD (57%) have not required   any treatment and have been managed with observation. A total of   18 of the 42 patients with OFD underwent surgery, 13 with curettage   and five with resection.

All patients with an adamantinoma were treated by surgery, three   with curettage, six with amputation and 12 with excision. In all,   two of the three treated with curettage developed local recurrence, requiring   further surgery.

The   protocol used conservative thresholds for C-reactive protein to   direct the medical attendant to aspirate the joint. The protocol   incorporated a clear set of laboratory and clinical criteria that   allowed a patient to be discharged home if all were met. Patients were   included if they presented to our emergency department within 120   days post-operatively with concerns for swelling, pain or infection   and were excluded if they had an unambiguous infection or if their   chief complaint was non-orthopaedic in nature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Concern for infection was the single most common (32%) reason   for presentation. A total of 296 patients made an emergency visit   and were included following THA or TKA. In the pre-protocol cohort,   11 of 27 patients were formally re-admitted to the hospital with   concern for infection but only five (45%) patients had actual infections   and received additional treatment. In comparison, in the post-protocol   cohort, 11 patients were admitted for suspected infection, nine   (82%) of whom were truly infected (p = 0.04).

A positive bacterial culture during re-implantation is associated with a poor outcome in two-stage exchange arthroplasty for deep infection
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of positive   cultures during the second stage of a two-stage revision arthroplasty   and to analyse the association between positive cultures and an   infection-free outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This single-centre retrospective review of prospectively collected   data included patients with a periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   of either the hip or the knee between 2013 and 2015, who were treated   using a standardised diagnostic and therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> with two-stage   exchange. Failure of treatment was assessed according to a definition   determined by a Delphi-based consensus.

Degenerative subtalar joints complicated by medial plantar intraneural cysts
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The pathogenesis of intraneural ganglion cysts is controversial.   Recent reports in the literature described medial plantar intraneural   ganglion cysts (mIGC) with articular branches to subtalar joints.   The aim of the current study was to provide further support for   the principles underlying the articular theory, and to explain the   successes and failures of treatment of mICGs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2006 and 2017, five patients with five mICGs were retrospectively   reviewed. There were five men with a mean age of 50.2 years (33   to 68) and a mean follow-up of 3.8 years (0.8 to 6). Case history,   physical examination, imaging, and intraoperative findings were   reviewed. The outcomes of interest were ultrasound and/or MRI features   of mICG, as well as the clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The five intraneural cysts followed the principles of the unifying   articular theory. Connection to the posterior subtalar joint (pSTJ)   was identified or suspected in four patients. Re-evaluation of preoperative   MRI demonstrated a degenerative pSTJ and denervation changes in   the abductor hallucis in all patients. Cyst excision with resection   of the articular branch (four), cyst incision and drainage (one),   and percutaneous aspiration/steroid injection (two) were performed.   Removing the connection to the pSTJ prevented recurrence of mIGC,   whereas medial plantar nerves remained cystic and symptomatic when   resection of the communicating articular branch was not performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings support a standardized treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> for mIGC   in the presence of degenerative disease at the pSTJ. By understanding   the pathoanatomic mechanism for every cyst, we can improve treatment   that must address the articular branch to avoid the recurrence of   intraneural ganglion cysts, as well as the degenerative pSTJ to   avoid extraneural cyst formation or recurrence.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:183–9.</p></sec>

An entirely automated method to score DSS-induced colitis in mice by digital image analysis of pathology slides
<p>The DSS (dextran sulfate sodium) model of colitis is a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Microscopic symptoms include loss of crypt cells from the gut lining and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the colon. An experienced pathologist requires several hours per study to score histological changes in selected regions of the mouse gut. In order to increase the efficiency of scoring, Definiens Developer software was used to devise an entirely automated method to quantify histological changes in the whole H&E slide. When the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> was applied to slides from historical drug-discovery studies, automated scores classified 88% of drug candidates in the same way as pathologists’ scores. In addition, another automated image analysis method was developed to quantify colon-infiltrating macrophages, neutrophils, B cells and T cells in immunohistochemical stains of serial sections of the H&E slides. The timing of neutrophil and macrophage infiltration had the highest correlation to pathological changes, whereas T and B cell infiltration occurred later. Thus, automated image analysis enables quantitative comparisons between tissue morphology changes and cell-infiltration dynamics.</p>

Trends in Hospitalizations and Survival of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure in Four US Communities (2005–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Community trends of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in diverse populations may differ by race and sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) sampled heart failure-related hospitalizations (≥55 years of age) in 4 US communities from 2005 to 2014 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. ADHF hospitalizations were validated by standardized physician review and computer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>, yielding 40 173 events after accounting for sampling design (unweighted n=8746).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the ADHF hospitalizations, 50% had reduced ejection fraction, and 39% had preserved EF (HFpEF). HF with reduced ejection fraction was more common in black men and white men, whereas HFpEF was most common in white women. Average age-adjusted rates of ADHF were highest in blacks (38.1 per 1000 black men, 30.5 per 1000 black women), with rates differing by HF type and sex. ADHF rates increased over the 10 years (average annual percentage change: black women +4.3%, black men +3.7%, white women +1.9%, white men +2.6%), mostly reflecting more acute HFpEF. Age-adjusted 28-day and 1-year case fatality proportions were ≈10% and 30%, respectively, similar across race-sex groups and HF types. Only blacks showed decreased 1-year mortality over time (average annual percentage change: black women –5.4%, black men –4.6%), with rates differing by HF type (average annual percentage change: black women HFpEF –7.1%, black men HF with reduced ejection fraction –4.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Between 2005 and 2014, trends in ADHF hospitalizations increased in 4 US communities, primarily driven by acute HFpEF. Survival at 1 year was poor regardless of EF but improved over time for black women and black men.</p></sec>

Genetics, Lifestyle, and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in Young and Apparently Healthy Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerosis starts in childhood but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a causal risk factor, is mostly studied and dealt with when clinical events have occurred. Women are usually affected later in life than men and are underdiagnosed, undertreated, and understudied in cardiovascular trials and research. This study aims at a better understanding of lifestyle and genetic factors that affect LDL-C in young women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We randomly selected for every year of age 8 women with LDL-C ≤1st percentile (≤50 mg/dL) and 8 women with LDL-C ≥99th percentile (≥186 mg/dL) from 28 000 female participants aged between 25 to 40 years of a population-based cohort study. The resulting groups include 119 and 121 women, respectively, of an average 33 years of age. A gene-sequencing panel was used to assess established monogenic and polygenic origins of these phenotypes. Information on lifestyle was extracted from questionnaires. A healthy lifestyle score was allocated based on a recently developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the women with LDL-C ≤1st percentile, 19 (15.7%) carried mutations that are causing monogenic hypocholesterolemia and 60 (49.6%) were genetically predisposed to low LDL-C on the basis of an extremely low weighted genetic risk score. In comparison with control groups, a healthier lifestyle was not associated with low LDL-C in women without genetic predispositions. Among women with LDL-C ≥99th percentile, 20 women (16.8%) carried mutations that cause familial hypercholesterolemia, whereas 25 (21%) were predisposed to high LDL-C on the basis of a high-weighted genetic risk score. The women in whom no genetic origin for hypercholesterolemia could be identified were found to exhibit a significantly unfavorable lifestyle in comparison with controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study highlights the need for early assessment of the cardiovascular risk profile in apparently healthy young women to identify those with LDL-C ≥99th percentile for their age: first, because, in this study, 17% of the cases were molecularly diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia, which needs further attention; second, because our data indicate that an unfavorable lifestyle is significantly associated with severe hypercholesterolemia in genetically unaffected women, which may also need further attention.</p></sec>

Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Interrogation at Forensic Autopsy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Postmortem interrogations of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), recommended at autopsy in suspected cases of sudden cardiac death, are rarely performed, and data on systematic postmortem CIED analysis in the forensic pathology are missing. The aim of the study was to determine whether nonselective postmortem CIED interrogations and data analysis are useful to the forensic pathologist to determine the cause, mechanism, and time of death and to detect potential CIED-related safety issues.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From February 2012 to April 2017, all autopsy subjects in the department of forensic medicine at the University Hospital Charité who had a CIED underwent device removal and interrogation. Over the study period, 5368 autopsies were performed. One hundred fifty subjects had in total 151 CIEDs, including 109 pacemakers, 35 defibrillators, and 7 implantable loop recorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 40 cases (26.7%) time of death and in 51 cases (34.0%) cause of death could not be determined by forensic autopsy. Of these, CIED interrogation facilitated the determination of time of death in 70.0% of the cases and clarified the cause of death in 60.8%. Device concerns were identified in 9 cases (6.0%), including 3 hardware, 4 programming, and 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> issues. One CIED was submitted to the manufacturer for a detailed technical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate the necessity of systematic postmortem CIED interrogation in forensic medicine to determine the cause and timing of death more accurately. In addition, CIED analysis is an important tool to detect potential CIED-related safety issues.</p></sec>

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely based on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of diagnosis of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (hazard ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard ratio death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-intensity statins with lower amputation and death risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-intensity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-based study to show that high-intensity statin use at the time of PAD diagnosis is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and mortality in comparison with low-to-moderate–intensity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as well.</p></sec>

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22–1.69; <i>P</i>=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Screening with twice-weekly single-lead iECG with remote interpretation in ambulatory patients ≥65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12-month period. This approach is also highly acceptable to this group of patients, supporting further evaluation in an appropriately powered, event-driven clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

An Evidence-Based Medicine Approach to Antihyperglycemic Therapy in Diabetes Mellitus to Overcome Overtreatment
<p>Overtreatment is pervasive in medicine and leads to potential patient harms and excessive costs in health care. Although evidence-based medicine is often derided as practice by rote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>ic medicine, the appropriate application of key evidence-based medicine principles in clinical decision making is fundamental to preventing overtreatment and promoting high-value, individualized patient-centered care. Specifically, this article discusses the importance of (1) using absolute rather than relative estimates of benefits to inform treatment decisions; (2) considering the time horizon to benefit of treatments; (3) balancing potential harms and benefits; and (4) using shared decision making by physicians to incorporate the patient’s values and preferences into treatment decisions. Here, we illustrate the application of these principles to considering the decision of whether or not to recommend intensive glycemic control to patients to minimize microvascular and cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Through this lens, this example will illustrate how an evidence-based medicine approach can be used to individualize glycemic goals and prevent overtreatment, and can serve as a template for applying evidence-based medicine to inform treatment decisions for other conditions to optimize health and individualize patient care.</p>

Aspirin for Primary Cardiovascular Risk Prevention and Beyond in Diabetes Mellitus
<p>Daily administration of low-dose aspirin has proved to be beneficial in preventing recurrent cardiovascular events. However, the role of aspirin for primary prevention in patients with no overt cardiovascular disease is more controversial. In fact, in lower risk patients, the modest benefit in reducing serious vascular events can be offset by the increased risk of bleeding, including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Diabetes mellitus has been associated with a substantially increased risk of both first and recurrent atherothrombotic events, which makes aspirin therapy of potential value in these subjects. Moving from general aspects of aspirin pharmacology and specific issues in diabetes mellitus, this article reviews the literature on the topic of aspirin for primary prevention in general, and in subjects with diabetes mellitus in particular, to culminate with arguments pro and con and a practical risk-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong> for aspirin initiation in daily practice.</p>

Genome- and Phenome-Wide Analyses of Cardiac Conduction Identifies Markers of Arrhythmia Risk
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>ECG QRS duration, a measure of cardiac intraventricular conduction, varies ≈2-fold in individuals without cardiac disease. Slow conduction may promote re-entrant arrhythmias.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genomic markers of QRS duration in 5272 individuals without cardiac disease selected from electronic medical record <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">algorithm</span></strong>s at 5 sites in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. The most significant loci were evaluated within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium QRS genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Twenty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 loci, previously described by CHARGE, were replicated in the eMERGE samples; 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were in the chromosome 3 <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>SCN10A</i> loci, where the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were rs1805126 in <i>SCN5A</i> with <i>P</i>=1.2×10<sup>−8</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=2.5×10<sup>−20</sup> (CHARGE) and rs6795970 in <i>SCN10A</i> with <i>P</i>=6×10<sup>−6</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=5×10<sup>−27</sup> (CHARGE). The other loci were in <i>NFIA</i>, near <i>CDKN1A</i>, and near <i>C6orf204.</i> We then performed phenome-wide association studies on variants in these 5 loci in 13859 European Americans to search for diagnoses associated with these markers. Phenome-wide association study identified atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias as the most common associated diagnoses with <i>SCN10A</i> and <i>SCN5A</i> variants. <i>SCN10A</i> variants were also associated with subsequent development of atrial fibrillation and arrhythmia in the original 5272 “heart-healthy” study population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>We conclude that DNA biobanks coupled to electronic medical records not only provide a platform for genome-wide association study but also may allow broad interrogation of the longitudinal incidence of disease associated with genetic variants. The phenome-wide association study approach implicated sodium channel variants modulating QRS duration in subjects without cardiac disease as predictors of subsequent arrhythmias.</p></sec>

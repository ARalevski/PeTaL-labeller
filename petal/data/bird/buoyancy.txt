Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of wood cell walls is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood materials perspective. The movement of water in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous networks formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and open conduits created by vessels and perforation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, water can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and fiber cell walls; however, these micropore networks are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the distribution of micropores in the secondary walls and middle lamellae of tracheids and fibers in relation to cell wall composition. Using two different types of probe, we identified a greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of secondary cell walls and a reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of the middle lamella. Areas of reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell wall of both tracheids and fibers that appear unrelated to lignification or the distribution of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood fiber cell walls were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity probes. Vessel cell walls were comparable to those of fibers in terms of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity in xylem. The highly lignified middle lamella, and lumen surface, act as a barrier to probe movement and, therefore, water movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

Self-assembly of lattices with high structural complexity from a geometrically simple molecule
<p>Here we report an anomalous porous molecular crystal built of C–H···N-bonded double-layered roof-floor components and wall components of a segregatively interdigitated architecture. This complicated porous structure consists of only one type of fully aromatic multijoint molecule carrying three identical dipyridylphenyl wedges. Despite its high symmetry, this molecule accomplishes difficult tasks by using two of its three wedges for roof-floor formation and using its other wedge for wall formation. Although a C–H···N bond is extremely labile, the porous crystal maintains its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity until thermal breakdown of the C–H···N bonds at 202°C occurs, affording a nonporous polymorph. Though this nonporous crystal survives even at 325°C, it can retrieve the parent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity under acetonitrile vapor. These findings show how one can translate simplicity into ultrahigh complexity.</p>

Beyond Porosity: 3D Leaf Intercellular Airspace Traits That Impact Mesophyll Conductance
<p>The leaf intercellular airspace (IAS) is generally considered to have high conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion relative to the liquid phase. While previous studies accounted for leaf-level variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity and mesophyll thickness, they omitted 3D IAS traits that potentially influence IAS conductance (g<sub>IAS</sub>). Here, we reevaluated the standard equation for g<sub>IAS</sub> by incorporating tortuosity, lateral path lengthening, and IAS connectivity. We measured and spatially mapped these geometric IAS traits for 19 Bromeliaceae species with Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) or C3 photosynthetic pathways using x-ray microcomputed tomography imaging and a novel computational approach. We found substantial variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity (0.04–0.73 m<sup>3</sup> m<sup>−3</sup>), tortuosity (1.09–3.33 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>), lateral path lengthening (1.12–3.19 m m<sup>−1</sup>), and IAS connectivity (0.81–0.97 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>) across all bromeliad leaves. The revised g<sub>IAS</sub> model predicted significantly lower g<sub>IAS</sub> in CAM (0.01–0.19 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) than in C3 (0.41–2.38 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) plants due to a coordinated decline in these IAS traits. Our reevaluated equation also generally predicted lower g<sub>IAS</sub> values than the former one. Moreover, we observed high spatial heterogeneity in these IAS geometric traits throughout the mesophyll, especially within CAM leaves. Our data show that IAS traits that better capture the 3D complexity of leaves strongly influence g<sub>IAS</sub> and that the impact of the IAS on mesophyll conductance should be carefully considered with respect to leaf anatomy. We provide a simple function to estimate tortuosity and lateral path lengthening in the absence of access to imaging tools such as x-ray microcomputed tomography or other novel 3D image-processing techniques.</p>

Hayabusa2 arrives at the carbonaceous asteroid 162173 Ryugu—A spinning top–shaped rubble pile
<p>The Hayabusa2 spacecraft arrived at the near-Earth carbonaceous asteroid 162173 Ryugu in 2018. We present Hayabusa2 observations of Ryugu’s shape, mass, and geomorphology. Ryugu has an oblate “spinning top” shape, with a prominent circular equatorial ridge. Its bulk density, 1.19 ± 0.02 grams per cubic centimeter, indicates a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity (>50%) interior. Large surface boulders suggest a rubble-pile structure. Surface slope analysis shows Ryugu’s shape may have been produced from having once spun at twice the current rate. Coupled with the observed global material homogeneity, this suggests that Ryugu was reshaped by centrifugally induced deformation during a period of rapid rotation. From these remote-sensing investigations, we identified a suitable sample collection site on the equatorial ridge.</p>

A surface gravity traverse on Mars indicates low bedrock density at Gale crater
<p>Gravimetry, the precise measurement of gravitational fields, can be used to probe the internal structure of Earth and other planets. The Curiosity rover on Mars carries accelerometers normally used for navigation and attitude determination. We have recalibrated them to isolate the signature of the changing gravitational acceleration as the rover climbs through Gale crater. The subsurface rock density is inferred from the measured decrease in gravitational field strength with elevation. The density of the sedimentary rocks in Gale crater is 1680 ± 180 kilograms per cubic meter. This value is lower than expected, indicating a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity and constraining maximum burial depths of the rocks over their history.</p>

Uncertainty boosts Brexit jitters for U.K. scientists
<p>U.K. scientists dreading the country's impending departure from the European Union, known as Brexit, now face possible outcomes ranging from undesirable to potentially disastrous. On 11 December, Parliament will vote on a withdrawal agreement that lays out the terms of a costly but smooth departure from the European Union, starting in March 2019. If the agreement is rejected, the United Kingdom could crash out instead, triggering chaos at the border, food shortages, and economic hardship. A no-deal exit would also immediately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">void</span></strong> many research agreements. Regardless of how the United Kingdom departs, it will have to negotiate new science agreements with the European Union and come up with a new EU immigration policy. A long-awaited government white paper on immigration is expected to be published this month. Two and a half years after the divisive popular referendum that launched the Brexit process, some scientists hold out hope for a reprieve: A growing number of politicians are agitating for a second referendum that might reverse the first one.</p>

Measurement of the neutron lifetime using a magneto-gravitational trap and in situ detection
<p>The precise value of the mean neutron lifetime, τ<sub>n</sub>, plays an important role in nuclear and particle physics and cosmology. It is used to predict the ratio of protons to helium atoms in the primordial universe and to search for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. We eliminated loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">levit</span></strong>ating polarized ultracold neutrons above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored neutrons do not interact with material trap walls. As a result of this approach and the use of an in situ neutron detector, the lifetime reported here [877.7 ± 0.7 (stat) +0.4/–0.2 (sys) seconds] does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.</p>

‘CAMERA’ records cell action with new CRISPR tricks
<p>Biologists long have devised ways to track the inner working of cells, tagging genes with fluorescent proteins and the like to better understand diseases, embryology, and environmental impacts. With the advent of CRISPR, best known as a genome editing tool, many groups have tried to fashion novel recording devices. In a proof-of-concept study published in this week's issue of <i>Science</i>, Harvard University's David Liu and Weixin Tang exploit the components of CRISPR to create two new recording systems that they call a CRISPR-mediated analog multievent recording apparatus, or CAMERA for short. One CAMERA system records with the help of plasmids, circular pieces of DNA that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">float</span></strong> around bacterial cell cytoplasms. In this scheme, CRISPR kicks into action in response to a stimulus like light, an antibiotic, or a virus, directing the destruction of one of two nearly identical "recorder" plasmids. A tilt in the ratio of recorder one to recorder two captures the exposure to the stimulus, even offering details about the duration and intensity of the exposure. The second CAMERA, which works in mammalian cells as well, uses a CRISPR variant called a base editor to alter the DNA in a "safe harbor" gene that can change its sequence without harming the cell. They show how the changes in the safe harbor gene's sequence can record signals from the cellular processes that a stimulus triggers, such as turning on a cancer-causing biochemical pathway.</p>

Ordered macro-microporous metal-organic framework single crystals
<p>We constructed highly oriented and ordered macropores within metal-organic framework (MOF) single crystals, opening up the area of three-dimensional–ordered macro-microporous materials (that is, materials containing both macro- and micropores) in single-crystalline form. Our methodology relies on the strong shaping effects of a polystyrene nanosphere monolith template and a double-solvent–induced heterogeneous nucleation approach. This process synergistically enabled the in situ growth of MOFs within ordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">void</span></strong>s, rendering a single crystal with oriented and ordered macro-microporous structure. The improved mass diffusion properties of such hierarchical frameworks, together with their robust single-crystalline nature, endow them with superior catalytic activity and recyclability for bulky-molecule reactions, as compared with conventional, polycrystalline hollow, and disordered macroporous ZIF-8.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p>Metals that are active catalysts for methane (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–melting temperature metals (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten metal alloy catalysts for pyrolysis of methane into hydrogen and carbon. All solid catalysts previously used for this reaction have been deactivated by carbon deposition. In the molten alloy system, the insoluble carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">float</span></strong>s to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi alloy achieved 95% methane conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure hydrogen without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products. Calculations show that the active metals in the molten alloys are atomically dispersed and negatively charged. There is a correlation between the amount of charge on the atoms and their catalytic activity.</p>

Direct atomic-level insight into the active sites of a high-performance PGM-free ORR catalyst
<p>Platinum group metal–free (PGM-free) metal-nitrogen-carbon catalysts have emerged as a promising alternative to their costly platinum (Pt)–based counterparts in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) but still face some major challenges, including (i) the identification of the most relevant catalytic site for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and (ii) demonstration of competitive PEFC performance under automotive-application conditions in the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)–air fuel cell. Herein, we demonstrate H<sub>2</sub>-air performance gains achieved with an iron-nitrogen-carbon catalyst synthesized with two nitrogen precursors that developed hierarchical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity. Current densities recorded in the kinetic region of cathode operation, at fuel cell voltages greater than ~0.75 V, were the same as those obtained with a Pt cathode at a loading of 0.1 milligram of Pt per centimeter squared. The proposed catalytic active site, carbon-embedded nitrogen-coordinated iron (FeN<sub>4</sub>), was directly visualized with aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, and the contributions of these active sites associated with specific lattice-level carbon structures were explored computationally.</p>

Three-dimensional holey-graphene/niobia composite architectures for ultrahigh-rate energy storage
<p>Nanostructured materials have shown extraordinary promise for electrochemical energy storage but are usually limited to electrodes with rather low mass loading (~1 milligram per square centimeter) because of the increasing ion diffusion limitations in thicker electrodes. We report the design of a three-dimensional (3D) holey-graphene/niobia (Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) composite for ultrahigh-rate energy storage at practical levels of mass loading (>10 milligrams per square centimeter). The highly interconnected graphene network in the 3D architecture provides excellent electron transport properties, and its hierarchical porous structure facilitates rapid ion transport. By systematically tailoring the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity in the holey graphene backbone, charge transport in the composite architecture is optimized to deliver high areal capacity and high-rate capability at high mass loading, which represents a critical step forward toward practical applications.</p>

Quantitative 3D evolution of colloidal nanoparticle oxidation in solution
<p>Real-time tracking of the three-dimensional (3D) evolution of colloidal nanoparticles in solution is essential for understanding complex mechanisms involved in nanoparticle growth and transformation. We used time-resolved small-angle and wide-angle x-ray scattering simultaneously to monitor oxidation of highly uniform colloidal iron nanoparticles, enabling the reconstruction of intermediate 3D morphologies of the nanoparticles with a spatial resolution of <i>~</i>5 angstroms. The in situ observations, combined with large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations, reveal the details of the transformation from solid metal nanoparticles to hollow metal oxide nanoshells via a nanoscale Kirkendall process—for example, coalescence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">void</span></strong>s as they grow and reversal of mass diffusion direction depending on crystallinity. Our results highlight the complex interplay between defect chemistry and defect dynamics in determining nanoparticle transformation and formation.</p>

The formation of peak rings in large impact craters
<p>Large impacts provide a mechanism for resurfacing planets through mixing near-surface rocks with deeper material. Central peaks are formed from the dynamic uplift of rocks during crater formation. As crater size increases, central peaks transition to peak rings. Without samples, debate surrounds the mechanics of peak-ring formation and their depth of origin. Chicxulub is the only known impact structure on Earth with an unequivocal peak ring, but it is buried and only accessible through drilling. Expedition 364 sampled the Chicxulub peak ring, which we found was formed from uplifted, fractured, shocked, felsic basement rocks. The peak-ring rocks are cross-cut by dikes and shear zones and have an unusually low density and seismic velocity. Large impacts therefore generate vertical fluxes and increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity in planetary crust.</p>

Mouse models of telomere dysfunction phenocopy skeletal changes found in human age-related osteoporosis
<p>A major medical challenge in the elderly is osteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>is and the high risk of fracture. Telomere dysfunction is a cause of cellular senescence and telomere shortening, which occurs with age in cells from most human tissues, including bone. Telomere defects contribute to the pathogenesis of two progeroid disorders characterized by premature osteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>is, Werner syndrome and dyskeratosis congenital. It is hypothesized that telomere shortening contributes to bone aging. We evaluated the skeletal phenotypes of mice with disrupted telomere maintenance mechanisms as models for human bone aging, including mutants in Werner helicase (<i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i>), telomerase (<i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i>) and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> double mutants. Compared with young wild-type (WT) mice, micro-computerized tomography analysis revealed that young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have decreased trabecular bone volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, as well as increased trabecular spacing. In cortical bone, young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have increased cortical thinning, and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity relative to age-matched WT mice. These trabecular and cortical changes were accelerated with age in <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice compared with older WT mice. Histological quantification of osteoblasts in aged mice showed a similar number of osteoblasts in all genotypes; however, significant decreases in osteoid, mineralization surface, mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate in older <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> bone suggest that osteoblast dysfunction is a prominent feature of precocious aging in these mice. Except in the <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i> single mutant, osteoclast number did not increase in any genotype. Significant alterations in mechanical parameters (structure model index, degree of anistrophy and moment of inertia) of the <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> femurs compared with WT mice were also observed. Young <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice had a statistically significant increase in bone-marrow fat content compared with young WT mice, which remained elevated in aged double mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants recapitulate the human bone aging phenotype and are useful models for studying age-related osteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>is.</p>

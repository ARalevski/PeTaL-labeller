Chiromagnetic nanoparticles and gels
<p>Chiral inorganic nanostructures have high circular dichroism, but real-time control of their optical activity has so far been achieved only by irreversible chemical changes. Field modulation is a far more desirable path to chiroptical devices. We hypothesized that magnetic field modulation can be attained for chiral nanostructures with large contributions of the magnetic transition dipole moments to polarization rotation. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ions and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong>s of paramagnetic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with chiral distortions of the crystal lattices exhibited chiroptical activity in the visible range that was 10 times as strong as that of nonparamagnetic nanoparticles of comparable size. Transparency of the nanoparticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong>s to circularly polarized light beams in the ultraviolet range was reversibly modulated by magnetic fields. These phenomena were also observed for other nanoscale metal oxides with lattice distortions from imprinted amino acids and other chiral ligands. The large family of chiral ceramic nanostructures and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong>s can be pivotal for new technologies and knowledge at the nexus of chirality and magnetism.</p>

Eye patches: Protein assembly of index-gradient squid lenses
<p>A parabolic relationship between lens radius and refractive index allows spherical lenses to avoid spherical aberration. We show that in squid, patchy colloidal physics resulted from an evolutionary radiation of globular S-crystallin proteins. Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments on lens tissue show colloidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong>s of S-crystallins at all radial positions. Sparse lens materials form via low-valence linkages between disordered loops protruding from the protein surface. The loops are poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>e and bind via a set of hydrogen bonds between disordered side chains. Peripheral lens regions with low particle valence form stable, volume-spanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong>s at low density, whereas central regions with higher average valence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong> at higher densities. The proteins demonstrate an evolved set of linkers for self-assembly of nanoparticles into volumetric materials.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Enhanced Therapeutic and Long-Term Dynamic Vascularization Effects of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Endothelial Cells Encapsulated in a Nanomatrix Gel
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)–derived endothelial cells (ECs) have limited clinical utility because of undefined components in the differentiation system and poor cell survival in vivo. Here, we aimed to develop a fully defined and clinically compatible system to differentiate hPSCs into ECs. Furthermore, we aimed to enhance cell survival, vessel formation, and therapeutic potential by encapsulating hPSC-ECs with a peptide amphiphile (PA) nanomatrix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We induced differentiation of hPSCs into the mesodermal lineage by culturing on collagen-coated plates with a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor. Next, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor were added for endothelial lineage differentiation, followed by sorting for CDH5 (VE-cadherin). We constructed an extracellular matrix–mimicking PA nanomatrix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong> (PA-RGDS) by incorporating the cell adhesive ligand Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) and a matrix metalloproteinase-2–degradable sequence. We then evaluated whether the encapsulation of hPSC-CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells in PA-RGDS could enhance long-term cell survival and vascular regenerative effects in a hind-limb ischemia model with laser Doppler perfusion imaging, bioluminescence imaging, real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The resultant hPSC-derived CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells (hPSC-ECs) showed highly enriched and genuine EC characteristics and proangiogenic activities. When injected into ischemic hind limbs, hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery and higher vessel-forming capacity compared with media-, PA-RGDS–, or human umbilical vein EC–injected groups. However, the group receiving the PA-RGDS–encapsulated hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery, more robust and longer cell survival (> 10 months), and higher and prolonged angiogenic and vascular incorporation capabilities than the bare hPSC-EC–injected group. Surprisingly, the engrafted hPSC-ECs demonstrated previously unknown sustained and dynamic vessel-forming behavior: initial perivascular concentration, a guiding role for new vessel formation, and progressive incorporation into the vessels over 10 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We generated highly enriched hPSC-ECs via a clinically compatible system. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that a biocompatible PA-RGDS nanomatrix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong> substantially improved long-term survival of hPSC-ECs in an ischemic environment and improved neovascularization effects of hPSC-ECs via prolonged and unique angiogenic and vessel-forming properties. This PA-RGDS–mediated transplantation of hPSC-ECs can serve as a novel platform for cell-based therapy and investigation of long-term behavior of hPSC-ECs.</p></sec>

Blockade of surface-bound TGF-β on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress antitumor immunity by inhibiting the killing of tumor cells by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong> cultures of dissociated B16 melanoma tumors. This system recapitulated the in vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the dissociated tumor cells resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T cells. Immunosuppression was not observed when tumors excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) also prevented immunosuppression. Immunosuppression depended on cell-cell contact or cellular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong> cultures did not inhibit tumor cell killing by T cells. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that tumor-specific Pmel-1 effector T cells physically interacted with tumor-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice. T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from B16 tumors alone were sufficient to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated killing, which depended on surface-bound TGF-β on the T<sub>regs</sub>. Immunosuppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic protein granzyme B and an increase in the cell surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings suggest that contact between T<sub>regs</sub> and antitumor T cells in the tumor microenvironment inhibits antimelanoma immunity in a TGF-β–dependent manner and highlight potential ways to inhibit intratumoral T<sub>regs</sub> therapeutically.</p>

Five-dimensional imaging of freezing emulsions with solute effects
<p>The interaction of objects with a moving solidification front is a common feature of many industrial and natural processes such as metal processing, the growth of single crystals, the cryopreservation of cells, or the formation of sea ice. Interaction of solidification fronts with objects leads to different outcomes, from total rejection of the objects to their complete engulfment. We imaged the freezing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emuls</span></strong>ions in five dimensions (space, time, and solute concentration) with confocal microscopy. We showed that the solute induces long-range interactions that determine the solidification microstructure. The local increase of solute concentration enhances premelting, which controls the engulfment of droplets by the front and the evolution of grain boundaries. Freezing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emuls</span></strong>ions may be a good analog of many solidification systems where objects interact with a solidification interface.</p>

The earliest modern humans outside Africa
<p>To date, the earliest modern human fossils found outside of Africa are dated to around 90,000 to 120,000 years ago at the Levantine sites of Skhul and Qafzeh. A maxilla and associated dentition recently discovered at Misliya Cave, Israel, was dated to 177,000 to 194,000 years ago, suggesting that members of the <i>Homo sapiens</i> clade left Africa earlier than previously thought. This finding changes our view on modern human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al and is consistent with recent genetic studies, which have posited the possibility of an earlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al of <i>Homo sapiens</i> around 220,000 years ago. The Misliya maxilla is associated with full-fledged Levallois technology in the Levant, suggesting that the emergence of this technology is linked to the appearance of <i>Homo sapiens</i> in the region, as has been documented in Africa.</p>

Tsunami-driven rafting: Transoceanic species dispersal and implications for marine biogeography

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

The magnetic field and turbulence of the cosmic web measured using a brilliant fast radio burst
<p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events thought to originate beyond the Milky Way galaxy. Uncertainty surrounding the burst sources, and their propagation through intervening plasma, has limited their use as cosmological probes. We report on a mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion measure 266.5 ± 0.1 parsecs per cubic centimeter), exceptionally intense (120 ± 30 janskys), linearly polarized, scintillating burst (FRB 150807) that we directly localize to 9 square arc minutes. On the basis of a low Faraday rotation (12.0 ± 0.7 radians per square meter), we infer negligible magnetization in the circum-burst plasma and constrain the net magnetization of the cosmic web along this sightline to <21 nanogauss, parallel to the line-of-sight. The burst scintillation suggests weak turbulence in the ionized intergalactic medium.</p>

The NDH-1L-PSI Supercomplex Is Important for Efficient Cyclic Electron Transport in Cyanobacteria
<p>Two mutants isolated from a tagging library of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. strain PCC 6803 were sensitive to high light and had a tag in <i>sll1471</i> encoding CpcG2, a linker protein for photosystem I (PSI)-specific antenna. Both mutants demonstrated strongly impaired NDH-1-dependent cyclic electron transport. Blue native-polyacrylamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong> electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analyses of the wild type and a mutant containing CpcG2 fused with yellow fluorescent protein-histidine6 indicated the presence of a novel NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex, which was absent in the <i>cpcG2</i> deletion mutant, the PSI-less mutant, and several other strains deficient in NDH-1L and/or NDH-1M. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down analyses on CpcG2-yellow fluorescent protein-histidine6, using antibody against green fluorescent protein and nickel column chromatography, confirmed the association of CpcG2 with the supercomplex. Conversely, the use of antibodies against NdhH or NdhK after blue native-polyacrylamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong> electrophoresis and in coimmunoprecipitation experiments verified the necessity of CpcG2 in stabilizing the supercomplex. Furthermore, deletion of CpcG2 destabilized NDH-1L as well as its degradation product NDH-1M and significantly decreased the number of functional PSI centers, consistent with the involvement of CpcG2 in NDH-1-dependent cyclic electron transport. The CpcG2 deletion, however, had no effect on respiration. Thus, we propose that the formation of an NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex in cyanobacteria facilitates PSI cyclic electron transport via NDH-1L.</p>

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Frequencies of Known Haplotypes from Pooled Sequence Data
<p>DNA samples are often pooled, either by experimental design or because the sample itself is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mixtur</span></strong>e. For example, when population allele frequencies are of primary interest, individual samples may be pooled together to lower the cost of sequencing. Alternatively, the sample itself may be a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mixtur</span></strong>e of multiple species or strains (e.g., bacterial species comprising a microbiome or pathogen strains in a blood sample). We present an expectation–maximization algorithm for estimating haplotype frequencies in a pooled sample directly from mapped sequence reads, in the case where the possible haplotypes are known. This method is relevant to the analysis of pooled sequencing data from selection experiments, as well as the calculation of proportions of different species within a metagenomics sample. Our method outperforms existing methods based on single-site allele frequencies, as well as simple approaches using sequence read data. We have implemented the method in a freely available open-source software tool.</p>

Extensive migration of young neurons into the infant human frontal lobe
<p>The first few months after birth, when a child begins to interact with the environment, are critical to human brain development. The human frontal lobe is important for social behavior and executive function; it has increased in size and complexity relative to other species, but the processes that have contributed to this expansion are unknown. Our studies of postmortem infant human brains revealed a collection of neurons that migrate and integrate widely into the frontal lobe during infancy. Chains of young neurons move tangentially close to the walls of the lateral ventricles and along blood vessels. These cells then individually <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>e long distances to reach cortical tissue, where they differentiate and contribute to inhibitory circuits. Late-arriving interneurons could contribute to developmental plasticity, and the disruption of their postnatal migration or differentiation may underlie neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

Ballistic miniband conduction in a graphene superlattice
<p>Rational design of long-period artificial lattices yields effects unavailable in simple solids. The moiré pattern in highly aligned graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures is a lateral superlattice with high electron mobility and an unusual electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion whose miniband edges and saddle points can be reached by electrostatic gating. We investigated the dynamics of electrons in moiré minibands by measuring ballistic transport between adjacent local contacts in a magnetic field, known as the transverse electron focusing effect. At low temperatures, we observed caustics of skipping orbits extending over hundreds of superlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive minibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities. At high temperatures, electron-electron collisions suppress focusing. Probing such miniband conduction properties is a necessity for engineering novel transport behaviors in superlattice devices.</p>

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons transmitted across a ballistic semiconductor junction are expected to undergo refraction, analogous to light rays across an optical boundary. In graphene, the linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the propagation of carriers across an electrostatically defined graphene junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell’s law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative refraction. Resonant transmission across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent transmission coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for realizing electron optics based on graphene p-n junctions.</p>

Ancient DNA reveals elephant birds and kiwi are sister taxa and clarifies ratite bird evolution
<p>The evolution of the ratite birds has been widely attributed to vicariant speciation, driven by the Cretaceous breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. The early isolation of Africa and Madagascar implies that the ostrich and extinct Madagascan elephant birds (Aepyornithidae) should be the oldest ratite lineages. We sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of two elephant birds and performed phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that these birds are the closest relatives of the New Zealand kiwi and are distant from the basal ratite lineage of ostriches. This unexpected result strongly contradicts continental vicariance and instead supports flighted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al in all major ratite lineages. We suggest that convergence toward gigantism and flightlessness was facilitated by early Tertiary expansion into the diurnal herbivory niche after the extinction of the dinosaurs.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mixtur</span></strong>e of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

GOLDEN2-LIKE Transcription Factors Regulate <i>WRKY40</i> Expression in Response to Abscisic Acid
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GARP (Golden2, ARR-B, Psr1) family transcription factors, GOLDEN2-LIKE1 and -2 (GLK1/2), function in different biological processes; however, whether and how these transcription factors modulate the response to abscisic acid (ABA) remain unknown. In this study, we used a <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant to examine the role of GLK1/2 in the ABA response. The <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant displayed ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes during seed germination and seedling development and an osmotic stress-resistant phenotype during seedling development. Genome-wide RNA sequencing analysis of the <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant revealed that GLK1/2 regulate several ABA-responsive genes, including <i>WRKY40</i>, in the presence of ABA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong> retardation assays showed that GLK1/2 directly associate with the <i>WRKY40</i> promoter via the recognition of a consensus sequence. Additionally, RNA sequencing analysis of the <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant and <i>wrky40</i> single mutant revealed that GLK1/2 and WRKY40 control a common set of downstream target genes in response to ABA. Furthermore, results of a genetic interaction test showed that the <i>glk1 glk2 wrky40</i> triple mutant displayed similar ABA hypersensitivity to the <i>wrky40</i> single mutant and the <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant, while the <i>glk1 glk2 wrky40 abi5-c</i> (<i>ABI5 CRISPR/Cas9</i> mutant) quadruple mutant displayed similar ABA hyposensitivity to the <i>abi5-7</i> single mutant. Based on these results, we propose that the GLK1/2-WRKY40 transcription module plays a negative regulatory role in the ABA response.</p>

Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular plants. Resurrection plants have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed across the land plant phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection plant lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection plant genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection plants convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection plants and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection plants. Together, these observations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in land plants through tandem gene duplication.</p>

Time-Course Transcriptome Analysis of Arabidopsis Siliques Discloses Genes Essential for Fruit Development and Maturation
<p>Fruits protect the developing seeds of angiosperms and actively contribute to seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion. Furthermore, fruit and seed development are highly synchronized and require exchange of information between the mother plant and the developing generations. To explore the mechanisms controlling fruit formation and maturation, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the valve tissue of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) silique using RNA sequencing. In doing so, we have generated a data set of differentially regulated genes that will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underpin the initial phase of fruit growth and, subsequently, trigger fruit maturation. The robustness of our data set has been tested by functional genomic studies. Using a reverse genetics approach, we selected 10 differentially expressed genes and explored the consequences of their disruption for both silique growth and senescence. We found that genes contained in our data set play essential roles in different stages of silique development and maturation, indicating that our transcriptome-based gene list is a powerful tool for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms controlling fruit formation in Arabidopsis.</p>

The Patterned Structure of Galactoglucomannan Suggests It May Bind to Cellulose in Seed Mucilage
<p>The interaction between mannan polysaccharides and cellulose microfibrils contributes to cell wall properties in some vascular plants, but the molecular arrangement of mannan in the cell wall and the nature of the molecular bonding between mannan and cellulose remain unknown. Previous studies have shown that mannan is important in maintaining Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed mucilage architecture, and that Cellulose Synthase-Like A2 (CSLA2) synthesizes a glucomannan backbone, which Mannan α-Galactosyl Transferase1 (MAGT1/GlycosylTransferase-Like6/Mucilage Related10) might decorate with single α-Gal branches. Here, we investigated the ratio and sequence of Man and Glc and the arrangement of Gal residues in Arabidopsis mucilage mannan using enzyme sequential digestion, carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong> electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry. We found that seed mucilage galactoglucomannan has a backbone consisting of the repeating disaccharide [4)-β-Glc-(1,4)-β-Man-(1,], and most of the Man residues in the backbone are substituted by single α-1,6-Gal. CSLA2 is responsible for the synthesis of this patterned glucomannan backbone and MAGT1 catalyses the addition of α-Gal. In vitro activity assays revealed that MAGT1 transferred α-Gal from UDP-Gal only to Man residues within the CSLA2 patterned glucomannan backbone acceptor. These results indicate that CSLAs and galactosyltransferases are able to make precisely defined galactoglucomannan structures. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested this patterned galactoglucomannan is able to bind stably to some hydrophilic faces and to hydrophobic faces of cellulose microfibrils. A specialization of the biosynthetic machinery to make galactoglucomannan with a patterned structure may therefore regulate the mode of binding of this hemicellulose to cellulose fibrils.</p>

An in Vivo Imaging Assay Detects Spatial Variability in Glucose Release from Plant Roots
<p>Plants secrete a plethora of metabolites into the rhizosphere that allow them to obtain nutrients necessary for growth and modify microbial communities around the roots. Plants release considerable amounts of photosynthetically fixed carbon into the rhizosphere; hence, it is important to understand how carbon moves from the roots into the rhizosphere. Approaches used previously to address this question involved radioactive tracers, fluorescent probes, and biosensors to study sugar movement in the roots and into the rhizosphere. Although quite effective for studying sugar movement, it has been challenging to obtain data on spatial and temporal variability in sugar exudation using these techniques. In this study, we developed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong>-based enzyme-coupled colorimetric and fluorometric assay to image glucose (Glc) in vivo and used this assay to show that there is spatial variability in Glc release from plant roots. We found that the primary roots of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) released more Glc from the base of the root than from the root tip and that the Glc release rate is reduced in response to water stress. These findings were confirmed independently by quantifying Glc release in well-watered and water-stressed maize primary roots using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. Additionally, we demonstrated differential patterns of Glc exudation in different monocot and eudicot plant species. These findings and their implications on root-rhizosphere interactions are discussed.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed coat’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed coat, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed coat pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed coat development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed coat permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

RECX Interacts with Mitochondrial RECA to Maintain Mitochondrial Genome Stability
<p>The chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes are essential for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. RECA and RECG, which are plant-specific homologs of the bacterial homologous recombination repair proteins RecA and RecG, maintain organelle genome stability by suppressing aberrant recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats (SDRs) in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. In this study, we analyzed the plant-specific factor RECX, a homolog of bacterial RecX that regulates RecA. RECX fused to GFP colocalized with mitochondrial RECA1 and chloroplast RECA2 on mitochondrial and chloroplast nucleoids, respectively. Knockout (KO) and overexpression (OEX) of <i>RECX</i> did not alter the <i>P. patens</i> morphological phenotype. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, however, showed that products from recombination between SDRs increased significantly in <i>RECX</i> OEX mitochondria and modestly in <i>RECX</i> KO mitochondria. By contrast, analysis of chloroplast DNA revealed no substantial alteration in the number of products from recombination between SDRs in <i>RECX</i> KO and OEX chloroplasts. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed interactions between RECX and RECA1 and between RECX and RECA2. Expression profiles showed a positive correlation between <i>RECX</i> and factors maintaining the stability of both organelle genomes and <i>RECA1</i>. Collectively, these results suggest that RECX maintains mitochondrial genome stability, likely by modulating RECA1 activity, and that the compromised function of RECX induces mitochondrial genome instability.</p>

The Ribosome-Bound Protein Pam68 Promotes Insertion of Chlorophyll into the CP47 Subunit of Photosystem II
<p>Photosystem II (PSII) is a large enzyme complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane of oxygenic phototrophs. The biogenesis of PSII requires the assembly of more than 30 subunits, with the assistance of a number of auxiliary proteins. In plants and cyanobacteria, the photosynthesis-affected mutant 68 (Pam68) is important for PSII assembly. However, its mechanisms of action remain unknown. Using a <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803 strain expressing Flag-tagged Pam68, we purified a large protein complex containing ribosomes, SecY translocase, and the chlorophyll-binding PSII inner antenna CP47. Using 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong> electrophoresis, we identified a pigmented Pam68-CP47 subcomplex and found Pam68 bound to ribosomes. Our results show that Pam68 binds to ribosomes even in the absence of CP47 translation. Furthermore, Pam68 associates with CP47 at an early phase of its biogenesis and promotes the synthesis of this chlorophyll-binding polypeptide until the attachment of the small PSII subunit PsbH. Deletion of both Pam68 and PsbH nearly abolishes the synthesis of CP47, which can be restored by enhancing chlorophyll biosynthesis. These results strongly suggest that ribosome-bound Pam68 stabilizes membrane segments of CP47 and facilitates the insertion of chlorophyll molecules into the translated CP47 polypeptide chain.</p>

Exocyst Subunit EXO70H4 Has a Specific Role in Callose Synthase Secretion and Silica Accumulation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Biogenesis of the plant secondary cell wall involves many important aspects, such as phenolic compound deposition and often silica encrustation. Previously, we demonstrated the importance of the exocyst subunit EXO70H4 for biogenesis of the trichome secondary cell wall, namely for deposition of the autofluorescent and callose-rich cell wall layer. Here, we reveal that EXO70H4-driven cell wall biogenesis is constitutively active in the mature trichome, but also can be activated elsewhere upon pathogen attack, giving this study a broader significance with an overlap into phytopathology. To address the specificity of EXO70H4 among the EXO70 family, we complemented the <i>exo70H4-1</i> mutant by 18 different Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) EXO70 paralogs subcloned under the EXO70H4 promoter. Only EXO70H4 had the capacity to rescue the <i>exo70H4</i>-<i>1</i> trichome phenotype. Callose deposition phenotype of <i>exo70H4-1</i> mutant is caused by impaired secretion of PMR4, a callose synthase responsible for the synthesis of callose in the trichome. PMR4 colocalizes with EXO70H4 on plasma membrane microdomains that do not develop in the <i>exo70H4-1</i> mutant. Using energy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ive x-ray microanalysis, we show that both EXO70H4- and PMR4-dependent callose deposition in the trichome are essential for cell wall silicification.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of the Arabidopsis Replication Timing Program
<p>Eukaryotes use a temporally regulated process, known as the replication timing program, to ensure that their genomes are fully and accurately duplicated during S phase. Replication timing programs are predictive of genomic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of chromatin organization. Although replication timing programs have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to genome sequence and chromatin structure. We used the thymidine analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the genome-wide replication timing program for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified genomic regions that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and correlated these regions with genomic features and with data for chromatin state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis chromosome arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric regions replicate late. Early and mid-replicating regions are gene-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late regions are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of chromatin states across the different times is complex, with each replication time corresponding to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mixtur</span></strong>e of states. Early and mid-replicating sequences interact with each other and not with late sequences, but early regions are more accessible than mid regions. The replication timing program in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite genomic organization with early/mid-replicating regions and late regions forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated lar<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong>y by chromatin accessibility.</p>

The <i>RIN-MC</i> Fusion of MADS-Box Transcription Factors Has Transcriptional Activity and Modulates Expression of Many Ripening Genes
<p>Fruit development and ripening is regulated by genetic and environmental factors and is of critical importance for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al, reproduction, and fruit quality. Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>ripening inhibitor</i> (<i>rin</i>) mutant fruit have a classic ripening-inhibited phenotype, which is attributed to a genomic DNA deletion resulting in the fusion of two truncated transcription factors, <i>RIN</i> and <i>MC</i>. In wild-type fruit, RIN, a MADS-box transcription factor, is a key regulator of the ripening gene expression network, with hundreds of gene targets controlling changes in color, flavor, texture, and taste during tomato fruit ripening; <i>MC</i>, on the other hand, has low expression in fruit, and the potential functions of the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene in ripening remain unclear. Here, overexpression of <i>RIN-MC</i> in transgenic wild-type cv Ailsa Craig tomato fruits impaired several ripening processes, and down-regulating <i>RIN-MC</i> expression in the <i>rin</i> mutant was found to stimulate the normal yellow mutant fruit to produce a weak red color, suggesting a distinct negative role for <i>RIN-MC</i> in tomato fruit ripening. By comparative transcriptome analysis of <i>rin</i> and <i>rin 35S</i>::<i>RIN-MC</i> RNA interference fruits, a total of 1,168 and 1,234 genes were identified as potential targets of RIN-MC activation and inhibition. Furthermore, the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene was shown to be translated into a chimeric transcription factor that was localized to the nucleus and was capable of protein interactions with other MADS-box factors. These results indicated that tomato RIN-MC fusion plays a negative role in ripening and encodes a chimeric transcription factor that modulates the expression of many ripening genes, thereby contributing to the <i>rin</i> mutant phenotype.</p>

In Vitro Characterization of Thermostable CAM Rubisco Activase Reveals a Rubisco Interacting Surface Loop
<p>To maintain metabolic flux through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in higher plants, dead-end inhibited complexes of Rubisco must constantly be engaged and remodeled by the molecular chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca). In C3 plants, the thermolability of Rca is responsible for the deactivation of Rubisco and reduction of photosynthesis at moderately elevated temperatures. We reasoned that crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants must possess thermostable Rca to support Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle flux during the day when stomata are closed. A comparative biochemical characterization of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Agave tequilana</i> Rca isoforms demonstrated that the CAM Rca isoforms are approximately10°C more thermostable than the C3 isoforms. Agave Rca also possessed a much higher in vitro biochemical activity, even at low assay temperatures. Mixtures of rice and agave Rca form functional hetero-oligomers in vitro, but only the rice isoforms denature at nonpermissive temperatures. The high thermostability and activity of agave Rca mapped to the N-terminal 244 residues. A Glu-217-Gln amino acid substitution was found to confer high Rca activity to rice Rca. Further mutational analysis suggested that Glu-217 restricts the flexibility of the α4-β4 surface loop that interacts with Rubisco via Lys-216. CAM plants thus promise to be a source of highly functional, thermostable Rca candidates for thermal fortification of crop photosynthesis. Careful characterization of their properties will likely reveal further protein-protein interaction motifs to enrich our mechanistic model of Rca function.</p>

Cellulose-Derived Oligomers Act as Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns and Trigger Defense-Like Responses
<p>The plant cell wall, often the site of initial encounters between plants and their microbial pathogens, is composed of a complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mixtur</span></strong>e of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin polysaccharides as well as proteins. The concept of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) was proposed to describe plant elicitors like oligogalacturonides (OGs), which can be derived by the breakdown of the pectin homogalacturon by pectinases. OGs act via many of the same signaling steps as pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to elicit defenses and provide protection against pathogens. Given both the complexity of the plant cell wall and the fact that many pathogens secrete a wide range of cell wall-degrading enzymes, we reasoned that the breakdown products of other cell wall polymers may be similarly biologically active as elicitors and may help to reinforce the perception of danger by plant cells. Our results indicate that oligomers derived from cellulose are perceived as signal molecules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), triggering a signaling cascade that shares some similarities to responses to well-known elicitors such as chitooligomers and OGs. However, in contrast to other known PAMPs/DAMPs, cellobiose stimulates neither detectable reactive oxygen species production nor callose deposition. Confirming our idea that both PAMPs and DAMPs are likely to cooccur at infection sites, cotreatments of cellobiose with flg22 or chitooligomers led to synergistic increases in gene expression. Thus, the perception of cellulose-derived oligomers may participate in cell wall integrity surveillance and represents an additional layer of signaling following plant cell wall breakdown during cell wall remodeling or pathogen attack.</p>

SDH6 and SDH7 Contribute to Anchoring Succinate Dehydrogenase to the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The succinate dehydrogenase complex (complex II) is a highly conserved protein complex composed of the SDH1 to SDH4 subunits in bacteria and in the mitochondria of animals and fungi. The reason for the occurrence of up to four additional subunits in complex II of plants, termed SDH5 to SDH8, so far is a mystery. Here, we present a biochemical approach to investigate the internal subunit arrangement of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) complex II. Using low-concentration detergent treatments, the holo complex is dissected into subcomplexes that are analyzed by a three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong> electrophoresis system. Protein identifications by mass spectrometry revealed that the largest subcomplex (IIa) represents the succinate dehydrogenase domain composed of SDH1 and SDH2. Another subcomplex (IIb) is composed of the SDH3, SDH4, SDH6, and SDH7 subunits. All four proteins include transmembrane helices and together form the membrane anchor of complex II. Sequence analysis revealed that SDH3 and SDH4 lack helices conserved in other organisms. Using homology modeling and phylogenetic analyses, we present evidence that SDH6 and SDH7 substitute missing sequence stretches of SDH3 and SDH4 in plants. Together with SDH5, which is liberated upon dissection of complex II into subcomplexes, SDH6 and SDH7 also add some hydrophilic mass to plant complex II, which possibly inserts further functions into this smallest protein complex of the oxidative phosphorylation system (which is not so small in plants).</p>

A <i>β</i>-Ketoacyl-CoA Synthase Is Involved in Rice Leaf Cuticular Wax Synthesis and Requires a CER2-LIKE Protein as a Cofactor
<p>Cuticular waxes are complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mixtur</span></strong>es of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, forming a natural barrier on aerial surfaces of terrestrial plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. In VLCFA biosynthesis, β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) is the key enzyme, catalyzing the first reaction in fatty acid elongation and determining substrate specificity. We isolated a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>wax crystal-sparse leaf 4</i> (<i>WSL4</i>) gene using a map-based cloning strategy. <i>WSL4</i> is predicted to encode a KCS, a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CER6. Complementation of the mutant <i>wsl4-1</i> with <i>WSL4</i> genomic DNA rescued the cuticular wax-deficient phenotype, confirming the function of <i>WSL4</i>. The load of wax components longer than 30 carbons (C30) and C28 were reduced markedly in <i>wsl4-1</i> and <i>wsl4-2</i> mutants, respectively. Overexpression of <i>WSL4</i> increased the cuticular wax load in rice leaves. We further isolated a cofactor of WSL4, OsCER2, a homolog of Arabidopsis CER2, by coimmunoprecipitation and confirmed their physical interaction by split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid experiments. Expression of <i>WSL4</i> alone in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells resulted in increased C24 but did not produce VLCFAs of greater length, whereas expressing <i>OsCER2</i> alone showed no effect. Coexpression of <i>WSL4</i> and <i>OsCER2</i> in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells yielded fatty acids up to C30. OsCER2 with a mutated HxxxD motif (H172E, D176A, and D176H) interrupted its interaction with WSL4 and failed to elongate VLCFAs past C24 when expressed with WSL4 in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells. These results demonstrated that WSL4 was involved in VLCFA elongation beyond C22 and that elongation beyond C24 required the participation of OsCER2.</p>

Physical Mapping of Amplified Copies of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Glyphosate-Resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Recent and rapid evolution of resistance to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicides, in several weed species, including common waterhemp (<i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>), poses a serious threat to sustained crop production. We report that glyphosate resistance in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> was due to amplification of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-P synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) gene, which encodes the molecular target of glyphosate. There was a positive correlation between <i>EPSPS</i> gene copies and its transcript expression. We analyzed the distribution of <i>EPSPS</i> copies in the genome of <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> using fluorescence in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis mapped the <i>EPSPS</i> gene to pericentromeric regions of two homologous chromosomes in glyphosate sensitive <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>. In glyphosate-resistant plants, a cluster of <i>EPSPS</i> genes on the pericentromeric region on one pair of homologous chromosomes was detected. Intriguingly, two highly glyphosate-resistant plants harbored an additional chromosome with several <i>EPSPS</i> copies besides the native chromosome pair with <i>EPSPS</i> copies. These results suggest that the initial event of <i>EPSPS</i> gene duplication may have occurred because of unequal recombination mediated by repetitive DNA. Subsequently, gene amplification may have resulted via several other mechanisms, such as chromosomal rearrangements, deletion/insertion, transposon-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion, or possibly by interspecific hybridization.

A Tomato Vacuolar Invertase Inhibitor Mediates Sucrose Metabolism and Influences Fruit Ripening
<p>Fruit ripening is a complex process that involves a series of physiological and biochemical changes that ultimately influence fruit quality traits, such as color and flavor. Sugar metabolism is an important factor in ripening, and there is evidence that it influences various aspects of ripening, although the associated mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we identified and analyzed the expression of 36 genes involved in Suc metabolism in ripening tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) fruit. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong> mobility shift assays indicated that <i>SlVIF</i>, which encodes a vacuolar invertase inhibitor, and <i>SlVI</i>, encoding a vacuolar invertase, are directly regulated by the global fruit ripening regulator RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN). Moreover, we showed that SlVIF physically interacts with SlVI to control Suc metabolism. Repression of <i>SlVIF</i> by RNA interference delayed tomato fruit ripening, while overexpression of <i>SlVIF</i> accelerated ripening, with concomitant changes in lycopene production and ethylene biosynthesis. An isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification-based quantitative proteomic analysis further indicated that the abundance of a set of proteins involved in fruit ripening was altered by suppressing <i>SlVIF</i> expression, including proteins associated with lycopene generation and ethylene synthesis. These findings provide evidence for the role of Suc in promoting fruit ripening and establish that <i>SlVIF</i> contributes to fruit quality and the RIN-mediated ripening regulatory mechanisms, which are of significant agricultural value.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied lar<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong>y on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Maximum likelihood and Bayesian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mixtur</span></strong>e model analyses of a data set composed of 1,934 orthologs with 45% missing data, as well as the 389 orthologs in the least saturated, stationary quartile, retrieve strong support for a sister-group relationship between Craterostigmomorpha and all other pleurostigmophoran centipedes, of which the latter group is newly named Amalpighiata. The Amalpighiata hypothesis, which shows little gene-tree incongruence and is robust to the influence of among-taxon compositional heterogeneity, implies convergent evolution in several morphological and behavioral characters traditionally used in centipede phylogenetics, such as maternal brood care, but accords with patterns of first appearances in the fossil record.</p>

Y Chromosome Analysis of Dingoes and Southeast Asian Village Dogs Suggests a Neolithic Continental Expansion from Southeast Asia Followed by Multiple Austronesian Dispersals
<p>Dogs originated more than 14,000 BP, but the location(s) where they first arose is uncertain. The earliest archeological evidence of ancient dogs was discovered in Europe and the Middle East, some 5–7 millennia before that from Southeast Asia. However, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that most modern dogs derive from Southeast Asia, which has fueled the controversial hypothesis that dog domestication originated in this region despite the lack of supporting archeological evidence. We propose and investigate with Y chromosomes an alternative hypothesis for the proximate origins of dogs from Southeast Asia—a massive Neolithic expansion of dogs from this region that lar<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gel</span></strong>y replaced more primitive dogs to the west and north. Previous attempts to test matrilineal findings with independent patrilineal markers have lacked the necessary genealogical resolution and mutation rate estimates. Here, we used Y chromosome genotypes, composed of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 5 single tandem repeats (STRs), from 338 Australian dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, and village dogs from Island Southeast Asia, along with modern European breed dogs, to estimate the evolutionary mutation rates of Y chromosome STRs based on calibration to the independently known age of the dingo population. Dingoes exhibited a unique haplogroup characterized by a single distinguishing SNP mutation and 14 STR haplotypes. The age of the European haplogroup was estimated to be only 1.7 times older than that of the dingo population, suggesting an origin during the Neolithic rather than the Paleolithic (as predicted by the Southeast Asian origins hypothesis). We hypothesize that isolation of Neolithic dogs from wolves in Southeast Asia was a key step accelerating their phenotypic transformation, enhancing their value in trade and as cargo, and enabling them to rapidly expand and replace more primitive dogs to the West. Our findings also suggest that dingoes could have arrived in Australia directly from Taiwan, independently of later <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>als of dogs through Thailand to Island Southeast Asia.</p>

Seasonal accumulation of acetylated triacylglycerols by a freeze-tolerant insect
<p>Most animals store energy as long-chain triacylglycerols (lcTAGs). Trace amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in animals, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy density than lcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36% of the neutral lipid pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly, <i>Eurosta solidaginis</i>, while only 17% of the neutral lipid pool is made up of typical lcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only during winter, appear to be synthesized by <i>E. solidaginis</i> and are not found in other freeze-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mixtur</span></strong>e of acTAGs found in <i>E. solidaginis</i> has a significantly lower melting point than equivalent lcTAGs, and thus remains liquid at temperatures at which <i>E. solidaginis</i> is frozen in the field, and depresses the melting point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for neutral lipids. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of freeze tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an animal, and the first evidence of dynamic interconversion between acTAGs and lcTAGs during development and in response to stress.</p>

The effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
<p>The effects of flight behavior on physiology and senescence may be profound in insects because of the extremely high metabolic costs of flight. Flight capacity in insects decreases with age; in contrast, limiting flight behavior extends lifespan and slows the age-related loss of antioxidant capacity and accumulation of oxidative damage in flight muscles. In this study, we tested the effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity by measuring wingbeat frequency, the ability to fly in a hypo-dense gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mixtur</span></strong>e, and metabolic rate in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Specifically, 5-day-old adult flies were separated into three life-long treatments: (1) those not allowed to fly (no flight), (2) those allowed – but not forced – to fly (voluntary flight) and (3) those mechanically stimulated to fly (induced flight). Flight capacity senesced earliest in flies from the no-flight treatment, followed by the induced-flight group and then the voluntary flight group. Wingbeat frequency senesced with age in all treatment groups, but was most apparent in the voluntary- and induced-flight groups. Metabolic rate during agitated flight senesced earliest and most rapidly in the induced flight group, and was low and uniform throughout age in the no-flight group. Early senescence in the induced-flight group was likely due to the acceleration of deleterious aging phenomena such as the rapid accumulation of damage at the cellular level, while the early loss of flight capacity and low metabolic rates in the no-flight group demonstrate that disuse effects can also significantly alter senescence patterns of whole-insect performance.</p>

The relative contribution of the medial and lateral femoral circumflex arteries to the vascularity of the head and neck of the femur
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to quantify the relative contributions of the medial   femoral circumflex artery (MFCA) and lateral femoral circumflex   artery (LFCA) to the arterial supply of the head and neck of the   femur.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We acquired ten cadaveric pelvises. In each of these, one hip   was randomly assigned as experimental and the other as a matched   control. The MFCA and LFCA were cannulated bilaterally. The hips   were designated LFCA-experimental or MFCA-experimental and underwent   quantitative MRI using a 2 mm slice thickness before and after injection   of MRI-contrast diluted 3:1 with saline (15 ml Gd-DTPA) into either   the LFCA or MFCA. The contralateral control hips had 15 ml of contrast   solution injected into the root of each artery. Next, the MFCA and   LFCA were injected with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mixtur</span></strong>e of polyurethane and barium sulfate   (33%) and their extra-and intra-arterial course identified by CT   imaging and dissection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The MFCA made a greater contribution than the LFCA to the vascularity   of the femoral head (MFCA 82%, LFCA 18%) and neck (MFCA 67%, LFCA   33%).

Why is the flu vaccine so mediocre?
<p>With flu season around the corner in the United States and Europe, the push has begun once again to encourage people to receive their annual shots. But over the past few years, it's become increasingly clear that the level of protection offered by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e varies widely each flu season, from 10% to 60%. And new research has revealed surprising reasons for its lackluster performance. For decades, it appeared that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e had an efficacy of 70% to 90%, but scientists now know that's because they were using a misleading test—replaced in the 1990s—to assess whether it protected people. The traditional explanation for failure also has been revamped. The flu strains selected for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e change each year based on what's in circulation, and scientists long blamed failure on mutations that occur in the circulating viruses in the 6–8 months that pass between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e being manufactured and used. But these "mismatches" sometimes occur in years when there's solid protection, and some years with lots of failure have good matches. It turns out that other forces at work include mutations in the strain selected for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e during the manufacturing process, which grows the virus in eggs. People's prior exposure to influenza also can bias their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong> toward a response that undermines that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e-triggered immunity. And the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e strain selection process itself relies heavily on the ferret animal model, which can mislead, too. There's an increasing call now to improve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e and organize the research community to more collaboratively try to develop a "universal" flu shot that works against many strains and lasts for many years, if not a lifetime. </p>

Ethics of maternal vaccination
<p>Innovations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e science have given us an incredible opportunity to leverage the maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong> to improve maternal, fetal, and infant health outcomes. Maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation reduces the risk of infant infection primarily through the transfer of protective maternal antibodies to the fetus (<i>1</i>). Although a growing number of countries are adopting maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e programs against diseases like influenza and pertussis, and there is an increased focus on including pregnant women in trials for new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, there is little discussion of the ethical underpinnings of maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e programs (<i>2</i>). We see the proposals thus far as being overly paternalistic, founded on a too-limited conception of risk-benefit analyses that has potential to derail the development and use of lifesaving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es. By contrast, an ethical approach focused on mothers' primary interests in protecting themselves and their children could serve as the basis of the ethical framework that guides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e policies.</p>

A sweeter approach to vaccine design
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es have transformed human health. Yet, guided primarily by empiricism for centuries, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design ultimately met its match in scourges such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, which continue to plague global health. The elusive search for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against such diseases has driven researchers of diverse expertise to forgo empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ology. Instead, they favor a reductionist approach inspired by how pathogens interact with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong>, which has evolved to distinguish foreign from self by sensing both physical (e.g, size) and chemical (e.g., foreign molecules) features of pathogens. This has guided the rational design of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es that mimic key pathogen properties, including arraying antigens on particles to increase recognition by antibody-producing B cells (<i>1</i>). However, the mechanisms by which multivalent antigen display on nanoparticles—either synthetic or natural—enhances immunity, and how this may influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design principles, remain unresolved. On page 649 of this issue, Tokatlian <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) help fill this knowledge gap by demonstrating that engineering nanoparticles with glycans—sugar molecules—is critical to potentiating antibody responses. This might lead to improved next-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against a wide diversity of pathogens.</p>

Zika rewrites maternal immunization ethics
<p>Pregnant women long have been excluded from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e studies because researchers are wary of causing unintended harm to the highly vulnerable developing fetus. But a new report from a group that represents many disciplines contends that ethics demand pregnant women be included in the trial of experimental Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, which are designed to protect babies from brain damage and other maladies caused by that mosquito-borne virus. The report is careful to point out that risk/benefit ratios must be weighed for each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e and each trial on a case-by-case basis—and indeed the Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e that has moved furthest in human studies rightly excludes pregnant women, says a co-author of the report. Other experimental maternal immunizations designed to protect babies are also being tested now, and one trial, for a respiratory syncytial virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, includes pregnant women. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e against group B streptococcus has also moved along the development pipeline and may soon enter trials with pregnant women, too. A second new report on maternal immunizations issued last week explores the challenges of doing safety studies in these women and their babies.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A new and clinically relevant murine model of solid-organ transplant aspergillosis
<p>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of death in organ transplant patients. The murine hydrocortisone-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion model of pulmonary aspergillosis is commonly used to characterise IFIs in these patients. However, this model does not take into account the effects of calcineurin inhibitors on transplant immunity to IFIs or the fungal calcineurin pathway, which is required for both virulence and antifungal drug resistance. To address these two issues, a new and clinically relevant transplant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion model of tacrolimus (FK506) and hydrocortisone-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was developed. We first characterised IFIs in 406 patients with a lung transplant. This showed that all of the patients with pulmonary aspergillosis were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ed with calcineurin inhibitors and steroids. Murine pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that an ideal dose of 1 mg/kg/day of FK506 intraperitoneally produced blood trough levels in the human therapeutic range (5–12 ng/ml). There was increased mortality from pulmonary aspergillosis in a transplant-relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion model using both FK506 and hydrocortisone as compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion using hydrocortisone only. Lung histopathology showed neutrophil invasion and tracheobronchitis that was associated with reduced lung tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα), JE (homologue of human MCP-1) and KC (homologue of human IL-8) at 24 hours, but increased lung TNFα, JE and KC at 48 hours when fungal burden was high. Furthermore, FK506 directly impaired fungal killing in alveolar macrophages <i>in vitro</i>, with FK506-mediated inhibition of the radial growth of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro</i> occurring at the low concentration of 5 ng/ml. Taken together, these findings show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ive activity of FK506 outweighs its antifungal activity <i>in vivo</i>. These observations demonstrate that FK506 impairs innate immune responses and leads to an incremental increase in susceptibility to IFIs when it is combined with steroids. This new and clinically relevant mouse model of invasive aspergillosis is a valuable addition to the further study of both fungal immunity and antifungal therapy in organ transplantation.</p>

Congo rapidly curtails Ebola
<p>An outbreak of Ebola that surfaced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 8 May has petered out and, for the first time, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e may have had a role in containing spread. To date, Ebola has struck 53 people in the DRC's Équateur province, killing 29. Most everyone lived in remote, difficult-to-reach villages, although four cases surfaced in the heavily populated city of Mbandaka, triggering serious concerns of an epidemic exploding. A vigorous, rapid effort to contain spread began immediately, with the DRC's Ministry of Public Health working with international partners to build treatment facilities, conduct surveillance, and trace contacts of cases. On 21 May, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e effort began that focused on creating a "ring" around cases by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ating people they may have come in contact with directly or indirectly. Some 3300 people received the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, which is still experimental and was given in a clinical trial. But the trial did not have a control group, so it will not be possible to assess the precise role, if any, it played in stopping spread. Then again, no one who received the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e developed the disease as of yet, and researchers noted that simply providing it helped with Ebola education.</p>

Safety concerns derail dengue vaccination program
<p>Efforts to control dengue suffered a major setback in late November when Sanofi Pasteur announced that its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, the only one on the market, should only be given to those who have already had one infection with the mosquito-borne disease that affects millions of people in the tropics each year. The dengue virus comes in four serotypes. A first infection is usually mild, but a second infection with a different serotype puts the patient at risk of a serious, occasionally life-threatening illness. A retrospective analysis of those who participated in phase III trials in 2011 found that those who had never had a dengue infection at the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation were in rare cases at risk of enhanced disease, although the Dengvaxia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e did reduce infections and cases of serious illness in those who had previously suffered from dengue. The news caused an uproar in the Philippines, where a mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation campaign was halted. And the incident is likely to lead health officials to carefully scrutinize other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es now in development.</p>

Critics assail paper claiming harm from cancer vaccine
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es for human papillomavirus (HPV), given to girls to prevent cervical cancer, have come under fire in several countries for allegedly causing such side effects as difficulty walking, headache, fatigue, poor concentration, and pain.

Blockade of surface-bound TGF-β on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress antitumor immunity by inhibiting the killing of tumor cells by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel cultures of dissociated B16 melanoma tumors. This system recapitulated the in vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the dissociated tumor cells resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion was not observed when tumors excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) also prevented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion depended on cell-cell contact or cellular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not inhibit tumor cell killing by T cells. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that tumor-specific Pmel-1 effector T cells physically interacted with tumor-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice. T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from B16 tumors alone were sufficient to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated killing, which depended on surface-bound TGF-β on the T<sub>regs</sub>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic protein granzyme B and an increase in the cell surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings suggest that contact between T<sub>regs</sub> and antitumor T cells in the tumor microenvironment inhibits antimelanoma immunity in a TGF-β–dependent manner and highlight potential ways to inhibit intratumoral T<sub>regs</sub> therapeutically.</p>

Ebola outbreak continues despite powerful vaccine
<p>New data show that an experimental Ebola <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e is "highly effective" and appears to have helped contain a long-lasting outbreak of the deadly disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but the conflict-ridden region has kept <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e teams from reaching many people who need it. The World Health Organization (WHO) revealed last week that what it called the "<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e efficacy" is 97.5% in people who either directly or indirectly came in contact with one of the 1200-plus cases of the disease. But nearly 20% of these contacts either could not be reached or refused the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e. WHO also for the second time asked an expert committee to decide whether the outbreak, which began in August 2018, should be declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. But the committee again said no, WHO did not need to ring the loudest alarm bell it had, largely because the virus had yet to spread to neighboring countries. WHO's director-general took the committee's advice, but urged the international community to provide more financial support, noting full funding of the response through July would require $104 million more than is now on hand.</p>

Indonesian fatwa causes immunization rates to drop

But many local clerics and confused parents have decided otherwise: The fatwa has led to a drop in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation rates, from 95% during the first phase of the campaign, last year on the island of Java, to 68% in the second phase, now in progress on the remaining islands.

Steep drop in Zika cases undermines vaccine trial
<p>When Zika raced through the Americas in 2016, it caused widespread alarm because the usually mild infection led to brain damage in babies. An intense effort began to develop a Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, and in March 2017, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a $110 million trial of its most promising candidate. The trial, now taking place in nine countries in North and South America, has hit a wall: There are too few cases of Zika in the region—largely because vast swaths of populations were infected and now are immune—to assess whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e works. As a result, researchers are now planning to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ate people and then intentionally infect them with the Zika virus. This human challenge model, used for decades with other diseases, was dismissed as too risky by an ethics committee just last year, mainly because infected people can sexually transmit the virus to people who are not in the study. But given the drop in transmission, a better understanding about the duration of sexual transmission, and decreasing interest from industry in Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e R&D, the human challenge model now looks like the best way to move the field forward.</p>

Vaccine trial launched to stop Ebola

Genome-wide identification of interferon-sensitive mutations enables influenza vaccine design
<p>In conventional attenuated viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, immunogenicity is often suboptimal. Here we present a systematic approach for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e development that eliminates interferon (IFN)–modulating functions genome-wide while maintaining virus replication fitness. We applied a quantitative high-throughput genomics system to influenza A virus that simultaneously measured the replication fitness and IFN sensitivity of mutations across the entire genome. By incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, we generated a hyper–interferon-sensitive (HIS) virus as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e candidate. HIS virus is highly attenuated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses, elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our approach, which attenuates the virus and promotes immune responses concurrently, is broadly applicable for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e development against other pathogens.</p>

A half-billion-dollar bid to head off emerging diseases

Now, CEPI has attracted nearly a half-billion dollars in funding, as it planned to announce at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust each donated $100 million, and the governments of Norway, Japan, and Germany make up the balance. CEPI also decided to focus initially on three diseases—Lassa, Nipah, and Middle East respiratory syndrome–coronavirus—and it will soon seek proposals from academia and industry to make these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es and conduct early phase trials so that they're at the ready for a real-word efficacy test when these pathogens emerge.</p>

Rapid development of a DNA vaccine for Zika virus
<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) was identified as a cause of congenital disease during the explosive outbreak in the Americas and Caribbean that began in 2015. Because of the ongoing fetal risk from endemic disease and travel-related exposures, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e to prevent viremia in women of childbearing age and their partners is imperative. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation with DNA expressing the premembrane and envelope proteins of ZIKV was immunogenic in mice and nonhuman primates, and protection against viremia after ZIKV challenge correlated with serum neutralizing activity. These data not only indicate that DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation could be a successful approach to protect against ZIKV infection, but also suggest a protective threshold of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e-induced neutralizing activity that prevents viremia after acute infection.</p>

The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 promotes T cell adhesion by activating the adaptor protein CrkII in the immunological synapse
<p>The adaptor protein CrkII regulates T cell adhesion by recruiting the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, an activator of Rap1. Subsequently, Rap1 stimulates the integrin LFA-1, which leads to T cell adhesion and interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The adhesion of T cells to APCs is critical for their proper function and education. The interface between the T cell and the APC is known as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical synapse. It is characterized by the specific organization of proteins that can be divided into central supramolecular activation clusters (c-SMACs) and peripheral SMACs (p-SMACs). Through total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and experiments with supported lipid bilayers, we determined that activated Rap1 was recruited to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical synapse and localized to the p-SMAC. C3G and the active (dephosphorylated) form of CrkII also localized to the same compartment. In contrast, inactive (phosphorylated) CrkII was confined to the c-SMAC. Activation of CrkII and its subsequent movement from the c-SMAC to the p-SMAC depended on the phosphatase SHP-1, which acted downstream of the T cell receptor. In the p-SMAC, CrkII recruited C3G, which led to Rap1 activation and LFA-1–mediated adhesion of T cells to APCs. Functionally, SHP-1 was necessary for both the adhesion and migration of T cells. Together, these data highlight a signaling pathway in which SHP-1 acts through CrkII to reshape the pattern of Rap1 activation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical synapse.</p>

Measles epidemic in Ukraine drove troubling European year
<p>Measles cases surged to nearly 83,000 in Europe in 2018—a 21st-century record and more than triple number in 2017, the World Health Organization announced last week. Driving the number was a massive and growing outbreak in Ukraine, where more than 54,000 cases were reported in 2018 and more than 15,000 have been logged already in 2019. Measles is extremely contagious and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e-preventable. Its complications can kill.The Ukranian epidemic stems from a decade of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e resistance and from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e supply disruptions after political upheaval and armed conflict broke out in 2014. In 2016, just 31% of Ukranian 6-year-olds had received the recommended two measles shots—a rate among the lowest in the world. "It's egregious to have people have measles in the 21st century in a European country," says Ulana Suprun, Ukraine's acting minister of health, who is steering an urgent government response to the epidemic.</p>

Innate immune recognition of glycans targets HIV nanoparticle immunogens to germinal centers
<p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design, antigens are often arrayed in a multivalent nanoparticle form, but in vivo mechanisms underlying the enhanced immunity elicited by such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es remain poorly understood. We compared the fates of two different heavily glycosylated HIV antigens, a gp120-derived mini-protein and a large, stabilized envelope trimer, in protein nanoparticle or “free” forms after primary immunization. Unlike monomeric antigens, nanoparticles were rapidly shuttled to the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network and then concentrated in germinal centers in a complement-, mannose-binding lectin (MBL)–, and immunogen glycan–dependent manner.

B cells, CMV, and stem cell transplant
<p>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for various malignant and nonmalignant conditions but can be complicated by infections such as reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is a ubiquitous DNA herpes virus comprising various distinct strains (<i>1</i>). Around 60 to 90% of healthy adults are seropositive, indicating past exposure to the virus, although infections in healthy people are often mild or asymptomatic. After initial acute infection, CMV enters a latent phase, similar to other herpes viruses. It has been suggested that CMV infection may confer an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical benefit, perhaps explaining its prevalence, because comparison of seropositive and seronegative individuals has shown that CMV infection results in greater responses to the flu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e (<i>2</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong> is essential to control the initial infection and to prevent later CMV reactivation, as demonstrated by the high incidence of CMV reactivation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ed patients such as HSCT recipients. Whereas the incidence and severity of CMV transcriptional reactivation and cell-to-cell dissemination after HSCT has substantially diminished since the adoption of prophylactic or preemptive antiviral therapies (<i>3</i>), CMV remains the most important viral infection after HSCT, especially in high-risk patients (such as seropositive recipients of seronegative donors), and can lead to life-threatening CMV disease in ∼10% of HSCT recipients (<i>4</i>). On page 288 of this issue, Martins <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) make the unexpected observation, in mice undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) as a model of HSCT, that strain-specific CMV antibodies made by host B cells play a crucial role in preventing CMV dissemination after BMT. They propose that passive transfer of antibodies that are matched to the latent CMV strain in HSCT recipients might constitute a powerful and easy therapeutic approach to prevent CMV disease.</p>

An autoimmune disease variant of IgG1 modulates B cell activation and differentiation
<p>The maintenance of autoreactive B cells in a quiescent state is crucial for preventing autoimmunity. Here we identify a variant of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) with a Gly<sup>396</sup>→Arg substitution (hIgG1-G396R), which positively correlates with systemic lupus erythematosus. In induced lupus models, murine homolog Gly<sup>390</sup>→Arg (G390R) knockin mice generate excessive numbers of plasma cells, leading to a burst of broad-spectrum autoantibodies. This enhanced production of antibodies is also observed in hapten-immunized G390R mice, as well as in influenza-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ated human G396R homozygous carriers. This variant potentiates the phosphorylation of the IgG1 immunoglobulin tail tyrosine (ITT) motif. This, in turn, alters the availability of phospho-ITT to trigger longer adaptor protein Grb2 dwell times in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical synapses, leading to hyper–Grb2–Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) signaling upon antigen binding. Thus, the hIgG1-G396R variant is important for both lupus pathogenesis and antibody responses after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation.</p>

India resurrects forgotten leprosy vaccine
<p>India is launching a new assault against an age-old scourge: leprosy.

Generation of influenza A viruses as live but replication-incompetent virus vaccines
<p>The conversion of life-threatening viruses into live but avirulent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es represents a revolution in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ology. In a proof-of-principle study, we expanded the genetic code of the genome of influenza A virus via a transgenic cell line containing orthogonal translation machinery. This generated premature termination codon (PTC)–harboring viruses that exerted full infectivity but were replication-incompetent in conventional cells. Genome-wide optimization of the sites for incorporation of multiple PTCs resulted in highly reproductive and genetically stable progeny viruses in transgenic cells. In mouse, ferret, and guinea pig models, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation with PTC viruses elicited robust humoral, mucosal, and T cell–mediated immunity against antigenically distinct influenza viruses and even neutralized existing infecting strains.

Antibodies to PfSEA-1 block parasite egress from RBCs and protect against malaria infection
<p>Novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es are urgently needed to reduce the burden of severe malaria. Using a differential whole-proteome screening method, we identified <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> schizont egress antigen-1 (PfSEA-1), a 244-kilodalton parasite antigen expressed in schizont-infected red blood cells (RBCs). Antibodies to PfSEA-1 decreased parasite replication by arresting schizont rupture, and conditional disruption of PfSEA-1 resulted in a profound parasite replication defect. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation of mice with recombinant <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> PbSEA-1 significantly reduced parasitemia and delayed mortality after lethal challenge with the <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> strain ANKA. Tanzanian children with antibodies to recombinant PfSEA-1A (rPfSEA-1A) did not experience severe malaria, and Kenyan adolescents and adults with antibodies to rPfSEA-1A had significantly lower parasite densities than individuals without these antibodies. By blocking schizont egress, PfSEA-1 may synergize with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es targeting hepatocyte and RBC invasion.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p>Influenza viruses are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage adaptation can cause extra evolution in the target strain, leading to ineffective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 sequences curated from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage adaptation is a very dynamic process that changes over time and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the influenza H3N2 virus evolves to be better adapted to the human environment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian environment) leads to increasingly stronger positive selection. On the contrary, passage adaptation to the mammalian cell lines changes from positive selection to negative selection. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon positions around the receptor binding domain strongly contributing to passage adaptation in the embryonated egg. These sites show strong convergent evolution and overlap extensively with positively selected sites identified in humans, suggesting that passage adaptation can confound many of the earlier studies on influenza evolution. Interestingly, passage adaptation in recent years seems to target a few codon positions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and adaptive evolution are working in synchrony driving viral adaptation. Future studies from sequence analysis to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e production need to take careful consideration of passage adaptation.</p>

Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite infection of developing honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) pupae
<p>The ectoparasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. <i>Varroa</i> interacts with honey bee viruses, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring viruses, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion of the developing honey bee hosts by <i>Varroa</i> has been proposed to explain the synergy between viruses and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee immune suppression by <i>V. destructor</i> is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced <i>V. destructor</i> mites on immune gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of deformed wing virus in the developing bees. Our data on different immune genes show little evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion of honey bees by <i>V. destructor</i>. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative immune gene expression and deformed wing virus titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion may contribute to the synergy between viruses and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee immune genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple immune genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong>.</p>

Tim-3 signaling in peripheral NK cells promotes maternal-fetal immune tolerance and alleviates pregnancy loss
<p>Pregnancy loss occurs in about 15% of clinically recognized pregnancies, and defective maternal-fetal immune tolerance contributes to more than 50% of these events. We found that signaling by the type I membrane protein T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-containing protein 3 (Tim-3) in natural killer (NK) cells had an essential protective role during early pregnancy. Tim-3 on peripheral NK (pNK) cells was transiently increased in abundance during the first trimester of pregnancy, which depended on interleukin-4 (IL-4)–signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and progesterone signaling. Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells displayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ive activities, including the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) in a transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1)–dependent manner. Tim-3 on pNK cells was stimulated by its ligand galectin-9 (Gal-9), leading to signaling by the kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AKT. In recurrent miscarriage (RM) patients, Tim-3 abundance on pNK cells was reduced and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ive activity of Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells was impaired. Compared to Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells from donors with normal pregnancies, RM patient Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells exhibited changes in DNA accessibility in certain genetic loci, which were reversed by inhibiting accessible chromatin reader proteins. Furthermore, Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells, but not Tim-3<sup>−</sup> pNK cells, reduced fetal loss in abortion-prone and NK cell–deficient mice. Together, our findings reveal a critical role for Tim-3–Gal-9 signaling–mediated immunoregulation by pNK cells in maternal-fetal immune tolerance and suggest that Tim-3 abundance on pNK cells is a potential biomarker for RM diagnosis.</p>

Targeting TNFR2 with antagonistic antibodies inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>
<p>Major barriers to cancer therapy include the lack of selective inhibitors of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) and the lack of broadly applicable ways to directly target tumors through frequently expressed surface oncogenes. Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is an attractive target protein because of its restricted abundance to highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ive T<sub>regs</sub> and oncogenic presence on human tumors. We characterized the effect of TNFR2 inhibition using antagonistic antibodies. In culture-based assays, we found that two TNFR2 antagonists inhibited T<sub>reg</sub> proliferation, reduced soluble TNFR2 secretion from normal cells, and enabled T effector cell expansion. The antagonistic activity occurred in the presence of added TNF, a natural TNFR2 agonist. These TNFR2 antibodies killed T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from ovarian cancer ascites more potently than it killed T<sub>regs</sub> from healthy donor samples, suggesting that these antibodies may have specificity for the tumor microenvironment. The TNFR2 antagonists also killed OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, which have abundant surface TNFR2. The antibodies stabilized antiparallel dimers in cell surface TNFR2 that rendered the receptor unable to activate the nuclear factor κB pathway and trigger cell proliferation. Our data suggest that, by targeting tumor cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ive tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>, antagonistic TNFR2 antibodies may be an effective treatment for cancers positive for TNFR2.</p>

Structural topology defines protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes in the HIV proteome

Moreover, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell targeting of highly networked epitopes distinguished individuals who naturally control HIV, even in the absence of protective <i>HLA</i> alleles.

Worries about Ebola outbreak grow, despite use of vaccine
<p>There's growing concern about an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that surfaced in August and, despite a coordinated response that has included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ating more than 40,000 people, persists. Although it's not being formally evaluated, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e appears to be having an impact, says Peter Salama, who coordinates the response for the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. But the outbreak in the northeastern region of the country is taking place in an area that has long suffered from armed conflict, which repeatedly has brought Ebola response teams to a halt. The outbreak has had some 500 cases, about half of which have resulted in death, making it the second largest Ebola outbreak on record. The largest, which took place in West Africa from 2014 to 2016, was considerably larger—28,000 cases, 11,000 deaths—but there is fear that if the international community does not do more to help the DRC by sending experienced personnel and more money, the outbreak could continue its spread—and could easily breach borders to neighboring countries. Editorials in two leading medical journals urge the United States government in particular to change a policy that, for safety reasons, bars staff from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from traveling to the DRC and helping in the affected region.</p>

Use of cholera vaccines expands, raising hopes

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally transmitted Zika virus has been documented in the United States this year, a reflection of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with efforts to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid spread of the virus through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population immune. This so-called "herd immunity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika virus to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of transmission between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e against Zika, which caused widespread alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain deformities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the virus while they were pregnant.

Mouse models of acute and chronic hepacivirus infection
<p>An estimated 71 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The lack of small-animal models has impeded studies of antiviral immune mechanisms.

Whereas immune-compromised mice developed persistent infection, immune-competent mice cleared the virus within 3 to 5 weeks. Acute clearance was T cell dependent and associated with liver injury. Transient depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells before infection resulted in chronic infection, characterized by high levels of intrahepatic regulatory T cells and expression of inhibitory molecules on intrahepatic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Natural killer cells controlled early infection but were not essential for viral clearance.

Inflammation boosts bacteriophage transfer between <i>Salmonella</i> spp.
<p>Bacteriophage transfer (lysogenic conversion) promotes bacterial virulence evolution. There is limited understanding of the factors that determine lysogenic conversion dynamics within infected hosts. A murine <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm) diarrhea model was used to study the transfer of SopEΦ, a prophage from <i>S</i>.Tm SL1344, to <i>S</i>.Tm ATCC14028S. Gut inflammation and enteric disease triggered >55% lysogenic conversion of ATCC14028S within 3 days. Without inflammation, SopEΦ transfer was reduced by up to 10<sup>5</sup>-fold. This was because inflammation (e.g., reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, hypochlorite) triggers the bacterial SOS response, boosts expression of the phage antirepressor Tum, and thereby promotes free phage production and subsequent transfer. Mucosal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation prevented a dense intestinal <i>S</i>.Tm population from inducing inflammation and consequently abolished SopEΦ transfer. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation may be a general strategy for blocking pathogen evolution that requires disease-driven transfer of temperate bacteriophages.</p>

Trispecific broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies mediate potent SHIV protection in macaques
<p>The development of an effective AIDS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e has been challenging because of viral genetic diversity and the difficulty of generating broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). We engineered trispecific antibodies (Abs) that allow a single molecule to interact with three independent HIV-1 envelope determinants: the CD4 binding site, the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), and the V1V2 glycan site. Trispecific Abs exhibited higher potency and breadth than any previously described single bnAb, showed pharmacokinetics similar to those of human bnAbs, and conferred complete immunity against a mixture of simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) in nonhuman primates, in contrast to single bnAbs. Trispecific Abs thus constitute a platform to engage multiple therapeutic targets through a single protein, and they may be applicable for treatment of diverse diseases, including infections, cancer, and autoimmunity.</p>

Inactivation of porcine endogenous retrovirus in pigs using CRISPR-Cas9

mTOR regulates metabolic adaptation of APCs in the lung and controls the outcome of allergic inflammation
<p>Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) occupy diverse anatomical tissues, but their tissue-restricted homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, working with mouse models of inflammation, we found that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)–dependent metabolic adaptation was required at discrete locations. mTOR was dispensable for dendritic cell (DC) homeostasis in secondary lymphoid tissues but necessary to regulate cellular metabolism and accumulation of CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs and alveolar macrophages in lung. Moreover, while numbers of mTOR-deficient lung CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs were not changed, they were metabolically reprogrammed to skew allergic inflammation from eosinophilic T helper cell 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) to neutrophilic T<sub>H</sub>17 polarity. The mechanism for this change was independent of translational control but dependent on inflammatory DCs, which produced interleukin-23 and increased fatty acid oxidation. mTOR therefore mediates metabolic adaptation of APCs in distinct tissues, influencing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical character of allergic inflammation.</p>

Can immunotherapy treat neurodegeneration?
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating age-related neurodegenerative disorder and the most frequent cause of senile dementia. The appearance of cognitive decline in this disease is associated with synaptic and neuronal loss, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, the accumulation of intracellular and extracellular plaques of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, and local neuroinflammation. The major focus in AD therapeutics has been to directly target specific factors in the brain that are believed to be associated with pathogenesis—primarily Ab and tau proteins—by using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical or pharmacological tools. However, in the clinic, these therapies have not shown efficacy in restoring cognitive function nor in arresting the disease course. In addition, treating brain inflammation, which often accompanies neurodegenerative diseases, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has shown limited or no effect on disease progression (<i>1</i>). Collectively, these results have led investigators to revisit the identification of the factors participating in AD and in particular the role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong>, including the resident brain myeloid cells (microglia) and the innate and adaptive arms of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong>.</p>

Immunology taught by rats
<p>Immunology may be best taught by viruses (<i>1</i>), and possibly by humans (<i>2</i>), but the rats of New York City surprisingly also have plenty to offer. A survey published in 2014 of the pathogens carried by rats trapped in houses and parks in Manhattan identified a huge burden of infectious agents in these animals, including several novel viruses (<i>3</i>). Among these are Norway rat hepaciviruses (NrHVs), which belong to the same family as hepatitis C virus (HCV). NrHVs were found in rat livers, raising the possibility of establishing a small animal model of human HCV infection. On page 204 of this issue, Billerbeck <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) fulfill this prediction.</p>

Structural basis for antibody-mediated neutralization of Lassa virus
<p>The arenavirus Lassa causes severe hemorrhagic fever and a significant disease burden in West Africa every year. The glycoprotein, GPC, is the sole antigen expressed on the viral surface and the critical target for antibody-mediated neutralization. Here we present the crystal structure of the trimeric, prefusion ectodomain of Lassa GP bound to a neutralizing antibody from a human survivor at 3.2-angstrom resolution. The antibody extensively anchors two monomers together at the base of the trimer, and biochemical analysis suggests that it neutralizes by inhibiting conformational changes required for entry. This work illuminates pH-driven conformational changes in both receptor-binding and fusion subunits of Lassa virus, illustrates the unique assembly of the arenavirus glycoprotein spike, and provides a much-needed template for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design against these threats to global health.</p>

Enhancement of Zika virus pathogenesis by preexisting antiflavivirus immunity
<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is spreading rapidly into regions around the world where other flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV), are endemic. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been implicated in more severe forms of flavivirus disease, but whether this also applies to ZIKV infection is unclear. Using convalescent plasma from DENV- and WNV-infected individuals, we found substantial enhancement of ZIKV infection in vitro that was mediated through immunoglobulin G engagement of Fcγ receptors. Administration of DENV- or WNV-convalescent plasma into ZIKV-susceptible mice resulted in increased morbidity—including fever, viremia, and viral loads in spinal cord and testes—and increased mortality. Antibody-dependent enhancement may explain the severe disease manifestations associated with recent ZIKV outbreaks and highlights the need to exert great caution when designing flavivirus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es.</p>

Aging increases cell-to-cell transcriptional variability upon immune stimulation
<p>Aging is characterized by progressive loss of physiological and cellular functions, but the molecular basis of this decline remains unclear. We explored how aging affects transcriptional dynamics using single-cell RNA sequencing of unstimulated and stimulated naive and effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from young and old mice from two divergent species. In young animals, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical activation drives a conserved transcriptomic switch, resulting in tightly controlled gene expression characterized by a strong up-regulation of a core activation program, coupled with a decrease in cell-to-cell variability. Aging perturbed the activation of this core program and increased expression heterogeneity across populations of cells in both species. These discoveries suggest that increased cell-to-cell transcriptional variability will be a hallmark feature of aging across most, if not all, mammalian tissues.</p>

Dengue may bring out the worst in Zika
<p>Mice infused against either dengue or West Nile virus became far more susceptible to disease and death from Zika virus, a new study published online in <i>Science</i> shows. The mice, engineered to cripple an immune gene that normally helps suppress Zika virus, of course may not represent what happens in humans. But antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known phenomenon with dengue, which has four “serotypes” that infect humans. Infection with one dengue serotype typically causes little harm, but the antibodies produced against it can set a people up for severe and even deadly disease if they subsequently become infected by a different serotype. Dengue, West Nile, and Zika are all from the flavivirus family and the researchers warn that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e against one could put a person at risk for ADE from a relative. Dengue is closet to Zika, and indeed the mouse experiment showed that dengue antibodies led to the most severe Zika disease. ADE also led to high levels of virus in mouse testes and spinal cords, which may help explain sexual transmission of Zika in humans and central nervous system diseases like microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barré Syndrome in adults.</p>

Redox-based reagents for chemoselective methionine bioconjugation
<p>Cysteine can be specifically functionalized by a myriad of acid-base conjugation strategies for applications ranging from probing protein function to antibody-drug conjugates and proteomics. In contrast, selective ligation to the other sulfur-containing amino acid, methionine, has been precluded by its intrinsically weaker nucleophilicity. Here, we report a strategy for chemoselective methionine bioconjugation through redox reactivity, using oxaziridine-based reagents to achieve highly selective, rapid, and robust methionine labeling under a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biocompat</span></strong>ible reaction conditions. We highlight the broad utility of this conjugation method to enable precise addition of payloads to proteins, synthesis of antibody-drug conjugates, and identification of hyperreactive methionine residues in whole proteomes.</p>

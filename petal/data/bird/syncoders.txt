Synaptic transmission from subplate neurons controls radial migration of neocortical neurons
<p>The neocortex exhibits a six-layered structure that is formed by radial migration of excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, for which the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of immature migrating multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s is required. Here, we report that subplate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, one of the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> types born in the neocortex, manage the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of migrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. By histochemical, imaging, and microarray analyses on the mouse embryonic cortex, we found that subplate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s extend neurites toward the ventricular side of the subplate and form transient glutamatergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es on the multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s just below the subplate. NMDAR (<i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor)–mediated synaptic transmission from subplate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s to multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s induces the multipolar-to-bipolar transition, leading to a change in migration mode from slow multipolar migration to faster radial glial-guided locomotion. Our data suggested that transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es formed on early immature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s regulate radial migration.</p>

Whispering neurons fuel cortical highways
<p>The mammalian neocortex is one of the most intricate entities found in nature, both in terms of structure and function. It is the brain region responsible for the execution of high-order functions, including sensory perception, motor control, cognition, and speech. Its development is equally complex because it requires that millions to billions (depending on the species) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s assemble in distinct layers and connect with exquisite precision to perform complicated information processing operations. During embryonic development, formation of the cerebral cortex involves the migration of excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s generated in the ventricular zone toward the cortical plate, where they establish their final position in six well-defined horizontal layers consisting of different types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and architecture. Along this migratory phase, developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s undergo a morphological transition from multipolar shape to bipolar morphology. Bipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s exhibit faster locomotion, quickly reaching their final destination. On page 313 of this issue, Ohtaka-Maruyama <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal that this important switch to bipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s is influenced by glutamate release from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s located at the subplate, just beneath the cortical plate. Subplate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s trigger this transformation by making transient synaptic contacts with multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in transit to the cortical laminae. Understanding this process is important because disruption of neocortical migration results in several human neuro-developmental diseases.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> made and released only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e to an adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> is important for understanding how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Niche-derived laminin-511 promotes midbrain dopaminergic neuron survival and differentiation through YAP
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the loss of dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in the midbrain (mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s) causes progressive loss of motor control and function. Using embryonic and mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, midbrain tissue from mice, and differentiated human neural stem cells, we investigated the mechanisms controlling the survival of mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. We found that the extracellular matrix protein laminin-511 (LM511) promoted the survival and differentiation of mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. LM511 bound to integrin α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>1</sub> and activated the transcriptional cofactor YAP. LM511-YAP signaling enhanced cell survival by inducing the expression of the microRNA miR-130a, which suppressed the synthesis of the cell death–associated protein PTEN. In addition, LM511-YAP signaling increased the expression of transcription factors critical for mDA identity, such as LMX1A and PITX3, and prevented the loss of mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in response to oxidative stress, a finding that warrants further investigation to assess therapeutic potential for PD patients. We propose that by enhancing LM511-YAP signaling, it may be possible to prevent mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> degeneration in PD or enhance the survival of mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in cell replacement therapies.</p>

Activation of CaMKIV by soluble amyloid-β<sub>1–42</sub> impedes trafficking of axonal vesicles and impairs activity-dependent synaptogenesis
<p>The prefibrillar form of soluble amyloid-β (sAβ<sub>1–42</sub>) impairs synaptic function and is associated with the early phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We investigated how sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> led to presynaptic defects using a quantum dot–based, single particle–tracking method to monitor synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking along axons. We found that sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> prevented new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation induced by chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). In cultured rat hippocampal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, nanomolar amounts of sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance from presynaptic terminals and increased the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. This caused an increase in the phosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) and its substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in, which markedly inhibited SV trafficking along axons between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s derived from a transgenic AD mouse model had similar defects, which were prevented by an inhibitor of CaMK kinase (CaMKK; which activates CaMKIV), by antibodies against Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>, or by expression a phosphodeficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in mutant. The CaMKK inhibitor also abolished the defects in activity-dependent synaptogenesis caused by sAβ<sub>1–42</sub>. Our results suggest that by disrupting SV reallocation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es, sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> prevents <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from forming new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es or adjusting strength and activity among neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. Targeting this mechanism might prevent synaptic dysfunction in AD patients.</p>

Wire together, fire apart
<p>The ability to learn and remember new experiences lies at the heart of our existence. After all, we are our memories. It has been widely accepted that memories are formed and stored via strengthening of neural connections due to the correlated activities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, where presumably one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> is causing or at least contributing to the activity of another connecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> and hence becomes associated with it. This principle is known as the Hebbian learning rule (<i>1</i>): i.e., if interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s become active very close in time during a particular event, their connection strengthens and “a memory” of this event is formed (<i>1</i>). In other words, “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s wire together, if they fire together” (<i>2</i>). Thus, neural connection must show some sort of plasticity—i.e., an ability to be modified based on the mutual firing patterns of interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s—in order to form memories and associations. Indeed, it has been shown that brief (hundreds of milliseconds) stimulations of interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s significantly improve signal transmission between the two, a phenomenon known as long-term potentiation (LTP). On page 1033 of this issue, Bittner <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a different learning mechanism called behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), which spans a considerably longer time course of several seconds, implying that no causal relationship of interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s may be necessary to form long-lasting associations between them.</p>

Single-cell methylomes identify neuronal subtypes and regulatory elements in mammalian cortex
<p>The mammalian brain contains diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al types, yet we lack single-cell epigenomic assays that are able to identify and characterize them. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that distinguishes cell types and marks regulatory elements. We generated >6000 methylomes from single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al nuclei and used them to identify 16 mouse and 21 human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al subpopulations in the frontal cortex. CG and non-CG methylation exhibited cell type–specific distributions, and we identified regulatory elements with differential methylation across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> types. Methylation signatures identified a layer 6 excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> subtype and a unique human parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> subtype. We observed stronger cross-species conservation of regulatory elements in inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s than in excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. Single-nucleus methylomes expand the atlas of brain cell types and identify regulatory elements that drive conserved brain cell diversity.</p>

The phosphorylation status of Ascl1 is a key determinant of neuronal differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>
<p>Generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from patient fibroblasts using a combination of developmentally defined transcription factors has great potential in disease modelling, as well as ultimately for use in regeneration and repair. However, generation of physiologically mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s <i>in vitro</i> remains problematic. Here we demonstrate the cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of a key reprogramming transcription factor, Ascl1, on multiple serine-proline sites. This multisite phosphorylation is a crucial regulator of the ability of Ascl1 to drive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> in the developing embryo; a phosphomutant form of Ascl1 shows substantially enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al induction activity in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos. Mechanistically, we see that this un(der)phosphorylated Ascl1 is resistant to inhibition by both cyclin-dependent kinase activity and Notch signalling, both of which normally limit its neurogenic potential. Ascl1 is a central component of reprogramming transcription factor cocktails to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from human fibroblasts; the use of phosphomutant Ascl1 in place of the wild-type protein significantly promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al maturity after human fibroblast reprogramming <i>in vitro</i>. These results demonstrate that cell-cycle-dependent post-translational modification of proneural proteins directly regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al differentiation <i>in vivo</i> during development, and that this regulatory mechanism can be harnessed to promote maturation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s obtained by transdifferentiation of human cells <i>in vitro</i>.</p>

Branch-restricted localization of phosphatase Prl-1 specifies axonal synaptogenesis domains
<p>Central nervous system (CNS) circuit development requires subcellular control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e abundance. We identified the <i>Drosophila</i> membrane-anchored phosphatase of regenerating liver (Prl-1) as an axon-intrinsic factor that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation in a spatially restricted fashion. The loss of Prl-1 in mechanosensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s reduced the number of CNS pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es localized on a single axon collateral and organized as a terminal arbor. Flies lacking all Prl-1 protein had locomotor defects. The overexpression of Prl-1 induced ectopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. In mechanosensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, Prl-1 modulates the insulin receptor (InR) signaling pathway within a single contralateral axon compartment, thereby affecting the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. The axon branch–specific localization and function of Prl-1 depend on untranslated regions of the <i>prl-1</i> messenger RNA (mRNA). Therefore, compartmentalized restriction of Prl-1 serves as a specificity factor for the subcellular control of axonal synaptogenesis.</p>

Astrocyte-derived interleukin-33 promotes microglial synapse engulfment and neural circuit development
<p>Neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and remodeling are essential to central nervous system (CNS) development and are dysfunctional in neurodevelopmental diseases. Innate immune signals regulate tissue remodeling in the periphery, but how this affects CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es is largely unknown. Here, we show that the interleukin-1 family cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) is produced by developing astrocytes and is developmentally required for normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e numbers and neural circuit function in the spinal cord and thalamus. We find that IL-33 signals primarily to microglia under physiologic conditions, that it promotes microglial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e engulfment, and that it can drive microglial-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e depletion in vivo.

Midbrain dopamine neurons control judgment of time
<p>Our sense of time is far from constant. For instance, time flies when we are having fun, and it slows to a trickle when we are bored. Midbrain dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s have been implicated in variable time estimation. However, a direct link between signals carried by dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and temporal judgments is lacking.

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Motor neurons and glia exhibit specific individualized responses to TDP-43 expression in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al and glial phenotypes. Recently, RNA-based mechanisms have been linked to ALS via RNA-binding proteins such as TDP-43, which has been studied <i>in vivo</i> using models ranging from yeast to rodents. We have developed a <i>Drosophila</i> model of ALS based on TDP-43 that recapitulates several aspects of pathology, including motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> loss, locomotor dysfunction and reduced survival. Here we report the phenotypic consequences of expressing wild-type and four different ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and glia. We show that TDP-43-driven neurodegeneration phenotypes are dose- and age-dependent. In motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, TDP-43 appears restricted to nuclei, which are significantly misshapen due to mutant but not wild-type protein expression. In glia and in the developing neuroepithelium, TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic puncta. TDP-43-containing RNA granules are motile in cultured motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, although wild-type and mutant variants exhibit different kinetic properties. At the neuromuscular junction, the expression of TDP-43 in motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s versus glia leads to seemingly opposite synaptic phenotypes that, surprisingly, translate into comparable locomotor defects. Finally, we explore sleep as a behavioral readout of TDP-43 expression and find evidence of sleep fragmentation consistent with hyperexcitability, a suggested mechanism in ALS. These findings support the notion that although motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and glia are both involved in ALS pathology, at the cellular level they can exhibit different responses to TDP-43. In addition, our data suggest that individual TDP-43 alleles utilize distinct molecular mechanisms, which will be important for developing therapeutic strategies.</p>

Excitatory neuron–specific SHP2-ERK signaling network regulates synaptic plasticity and memory
<p>Mutations in RAS signaling pathway components cause diverse neurodevelopmental disorders, collectively called RASopathies. Previous studies have suggested that dysregulation in RAS–extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) activation is restricted to distinct cell types in different RASopathies. Some cases of Noonan syndrome (NS) are associated with gain-of-function mutations in the phosphatase SHP2 (encoded by <i>PTPN11</i>); however, SHP2 is abundant in multiple cell types, so it is unclear which cell type(s) contribute to NS phenotypes. Here, we found that expressing the NS-associated mutant SHP2<sup>D61G</sup> in excitatory, but not inhibitory, hippocampal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s increased ERK signaling and impaired both long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory in mice, although endogenous SHP2 was expressed in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al types. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the genes encoding SHP2-interacting proteins that are critical for ERK activation, such as GAB1 and GRB2, were enriched in excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. Accordingly, expressing a dominant-negative mutant of GAB1, which reduced its interaction with SHP2<sup>D61G</sup>, selectively in excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, reversed SHP2<sup>D61G</sup>-mediated deficits. Moreover, ectopic expression of GAB1 and GRB2 together with SHP2<sup>D61G</sup> in inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s resulted in ERK activation. These results demonstrate that RAS-ERK signaling networks are notably different between excitatory and inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, accounting for the cell type–specific pathophysiology of NS and perhaps other RASopathies.</p>

Proteomic analysis of S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in rat cortical neurons
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s modulate gene expression in response to extrinsic signals to enable brain development, cognition, and learning and to process stimuli that regulate systemic physiological functions. This signal-to-gene communication is facilitated by posttranslational modifications such as S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) moiety to cysteine thiols. In the cerebral cortex, S-nitrosylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is required for gene transcription during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al development, but few other nuclear targets of S-nitrosylation have been identified to date. We used S-nitrosothiol resin-assisted capture on NO donor-treated nuclear extracts from rat cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and identified 614 S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins. Of these, 131 proteins have not previously been shown to be S-nitrosylated in any system, and 555 are previously unidentified targets of S-nitrosylation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. The sites of S-nitrosylation were identified for 59% of the targets, and motifs containing single lysines were found at 33% of these sites. In addition, lysine motifs were necessary for promoting the S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 and methyl-CpG binding protein 3 (MBD3). Moreover, S-nitrosylation of the histone-binding protein RBBP7 was necessary for dendritogenesis of cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in culture. Together, our findings characterize S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and identify S-nitrosylation motifs that may be shared with other targets of NO signaling.</p>

Inhibition of somatosensory mechanotransduction by annexin A6

Sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from these mice showed increased activity of the cation channel Piezo2, which mediates a rapidly adapting mechano-gated current linked to proprioception and touch, and a decrease in mechanically activated, slowly adapting currents. Conversely, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s inhibited rapidly adapting currents that were partially mediated by Piezo2. Furthermore, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s attenuated mechanical pain in a mouse model of osteoarthritis, a disease in which mechanically evoked pain is particularly problematic.

Neuronal activity drives FMRP- and HSPG-dependent matrix metalloproteinase function required for rapid synaptogenesis
<p>Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) functions modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and activity-dependent plasticity. Aberrant MMP activity is implicated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disease caused by the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP and characterized by neurological dysfunction and intellectual disability. Gene expression studies in <i>Drosophila</i> suggest that Mmps cooperate with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp) to restrict trans-synaptic Wnt signaling and that synaptogenic defects in the fly model of FXS are alleviated by either inhibition of Mmp or genetic reduction of Dlp. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) glutamatergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e to test activity-dependent Dlp and Mmp intersections in the context of FXS. We found that rapid, activity-dependent synaptic bouton formation depended on secreted Mmp1. Acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al stimulation reduced the abundance of Mmp2 but increased that of both Mmp1 and Dlp, as well as enhanced the colocalization of Dlp and Mmp1 at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e. Dlp function promoted Mmp1 abundance, localization, and proteolytic activity around <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. Dlp glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains mediated this functional interaction with Mmp1. In the FXS fly model, activity-dependent increases in Mmp1 abundance and activity were lost but were restored by reducing the amount of synaptic Dlp. The data suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al activity-induced, HSPG-dependent Mmp regulation drives activity-dependent synaptogenesis and that this is impaired in FXS. Thus, exploring this mechanism further may reveal therapeutic targets that have the potential to restore synaptogenesis in FXS patients.</p>

Architects of neuronal wiring

Locally coordinated synaptic plasticity of visual cortex neurons in vivo
<p>Plasticity of cortical responses in vivo involves activity-dependent changes at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es, but the manner in which different forms of synaptic plasticity act together to create functional changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s remains unknown. We found that spike timing–induced receptive field plasticity of visual cortex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in mice is anchored by increases in the synaptic strength of identified spines. This is accompanied by a decrease in the strength of adjacent spines on a slower time scale. The locally coordinated potentiation and depression of spines involves prominent AMPA receptor redistribution via targeted expression of the immediate early gene product Arc. Hebbian strengthening of activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es and heterosynaptic weakening of adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es thus cooperatively orchestrate cell-wide plasticity of functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al responses.</p>

Glia relay differentiation cues to coordinate neuronal development in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al birth and specification must be coordinated across the developing brain to generate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s that constitute neural circuits. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system to investigate how development is coordinated to establish retinotopy, a feature of all visual systems. Photoreceptors achieve retinotopy by inducing their target field in the optic lobe, the lamina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, with a secreted differentiation cue, epidermal growth factor (EGF). We find that communication between photoreceptors and lamina cells requires a signaling relay through glia. In response to photoreceptor-EGF, glia produce insulin-like peptides, which induce lamina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al differentiation. Our study identifies a role for glia in coordinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al development across distinct brain regions, thus reconciling the timing of column assembly with that of delayed differentiation, as well as the spatiotemporal pattern of lamina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> differentiation.</p>

Rapid binge-like eating and body weight gain driven by zona incerta GABA neuron activation
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al substrate for binge eating, which can at times lead to obesity, is not clear.

Minimal intermittent stimulation led to body weight gain; ZI GABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> ablation reduced weight. ZI stimulation generated 35% of normal 24-hour food intake in just 10 minutes. The ZI cells were excited by food deprivation and the gut hunger signal ghrelin. In contrast, stimulation of excitatory axons from the parasubthalamic nucleus to PVT or direct stimulation of PVT glutamate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s reduced food intake.

Decreased abundance of TRESK two-pore domain potassium channels in sensory neurons underlies the pain associated with bone metastasis
<p>Cancer-associated pain is debilitating. Understanding the mechanisms that cause it can inform drug development that may improve quality of life in patients. Here, we found that the reduced abundance of potassium channels called TRESK in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s sensitized nociceptive sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and cancer-associated pain. Overexpressing TRESK in DRG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s suppressed tumor-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in bone metastasis model rats, whereas knocking down TRESK increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in normal rats. Mechanistically, tumor-associated production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activated the receptor VEGFR2 on DRGs, which increased the abundance of the calcineurin inhibitor DSCR1, which, in turn, decreased calcineurin-mediated activation of the transcription factor NFAT, thereby reducing the transcription of the gene encoding TRESK. Intrathecal application of exogenous calcineurin to tumor-bearing rats rescued TRESK abundance and abrogated both DRG hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity, whereas either inhibition or knockdown of calcineurin in normal rats reduced TRESK abundance and increased DRG excitability and pain sensitivity. These findings identify a potentially targetable mechanism that may cause bone metastasis–associated pain in cancer patients.</p>

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased activity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al excitability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic excitability of LHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic excitability, reduced GABAergic transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased activity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s to subsequent, acute CRF exposure. Activating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA activity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic excitability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated disorders.</p>

The amyloid-β oligomer Aβ*56 induces specific alterations in neuronal signaling that lead to tau phosphorylation and aggregation
<p>Oligomeric forms of amyloid-forming proteins are believed to be the principal initiating bioactive species in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers are implicated in AD-associated phosphorylation and aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. To investigate the specific molecular pathways activated by different assemblies, we isolated various forms of Aβ from Tg2576 mice, which are a model for AD. We found that Aβ*56, a 56-kDa oligomer that is detected before patients develop overt signs of AD, induced specific changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al signaling. In primary cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, Aβ*56 interacted with <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), increased NMDAR-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and consequently increased intracellular calcium concentrations and the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calmodulin kinase IIα (CaMKIIα). In cultured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and in the brains of Tg2576 mice, activated CaMKIIα was associated with increased site-specific phosphorylation and missorting of tau, both of which are associated with AD pathology. In contrast, exposure of cultured primary cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s to other oligomeric Aβ forms (dimers and trimers) did not trigger these effects. Our results indicate that distinct Aβ assemblies activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al signaling pathways in a selective manner and that dissecting the molecular events caused by each oligomer may inform more effective therapeutic strategies.</p>

Synergistic regulation of serotonin and opioid signaling contributes to pain insensitivity in Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 knockout mice
<p>Genetic loss of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7<sup>−/−</sup>) results in lifelong insensitivity to pain in mice and humans. One underlying cause is an increase in the production of endogenous opioids in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. We analyzed whether Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 deficiency altered nociceptive heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, such as initiated by GPCRs that respond to serotonin (pronociceptive) or opioids (antinociceptive), in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. We found that the nociceptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 knockout (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7<sup>−/−</sup>) mice, but not those of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 knockout (Na<sub>v</sub>1.8<sup>−/−</sup>) mice, exhibited decreased pronociceptive serotonergic signaling through the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, which are Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs that stimulate the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulting in protein kinase A (PKA) activity, as well as reduced abundance of the RIIβ regulatory subunit of PKA. Simultaneously, the efficacy of antinociceptive opioid signaling mediated by the Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled mu opioid receptors was increased. Consequently, opioids inhibited more efficiently tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium currents, which are important for pain-initiating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al activity in nociceptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. Thus, Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 controls the efficacy and balance of GPCR-mediated pro- and antinociceptive intracellular signaling, such that without Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, the balance is shifted toward antinociception, resulting in lifelong endogenous analgesia.</p>

The paraventricular thalamus is a critical thalamic area for wakefulness

Suppression of PVT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al activity caused a reduction in wakefulness, whereas activation of PVT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s induced a transition from sleep to wakefulness and an acceleration of emergence from general anesthesia.

Dopamine oxidation mediates mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease

This toxic cascade was observed in human, but not in mouse, PD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s at least in part because of species-specific differences in dopamine metabolism.

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive

After optogenetic activation of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, mice drank water and performed an operant lever-pressing task for water reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency.

How the body learns to hurt

They found that triggering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in one part of the hippocampus—a sliver of brain tissue key to memory—can make linked, distant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s more likely to fire for many hours afterward, a phenomenon now known as long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP leaves its mark by strengthening some connections between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es–the connections between brain cells—and not others. Now, researchers have found a new type of LTP that may explain how pain itself "teaches" the brain.

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?

Is this remodeling only a property of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple myelin sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. This insulation facilitates rapid nerve conduction, increasing velocities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of myelinated nerves (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural circuits are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural circuits? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

Heterochronic Genes Turn Back the Clock in Old Neurons
<p>Although some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> types regenerate better than others, all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s lose the ability to regenerate with age. This intrinsic decline is the primary cause of regeneration failure even in permissive environments. This was shown in 1995 by comparing the regeneration ability of retinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from different aged retinas growing into tectums of different ages (<i>1</i>). Embryonic retinal axons regrew into tectum of any age, including older tectum with an inhibitory glial environment, whereas postnatal day 2 or older retinal axons failed to regrow even into embryonic tectum. This indicated a “programmed” loss of axon regeneration ability with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> age. Similarly, young hindbrain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s transplanted into older spinal cords could regenerate axons into a normally inhibitory myelinated environment (<i>2</i>). Despite the clear therapeutic implications of these observations, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling age-dependent regenerative capacity were unclear. On page 372 in this issue, Zou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that the highly conserved <i>let-7</i>–LIN-41 heterochronic signaling pathway is responsible for part of the age-related decline in axon regeneration in the worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.</p>

Axon degeneration and PGC-1α-mediated protection in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein toxicity
<p>α-synuclein (aSyn) expression is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In animal models of these diseases, axon pathology often precedes cell death, raising the question of whether aSyn has compartment-specific toxic effects that could require early and/or independent therapeutic intervention. The relevance of axonal pathology to degeneration can only be addressed through longitudinal, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al compartments. With current imaging methods, dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s do not readily lend themselves to such a task in any vertebrate system. We therefore expressed human wild-type aSyn in zebrafish peripheral sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, which project elaborate superficial axons that can be continuously imaged <i>in vivo</i>. Axonal outgrowth was normal in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s but, by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), many aSyn-expressing axons became dystrophic, with focal varicosities or diffuse beading. Approximately 20% of aSyn-expressing cells died by 3 dpf. Time-lapse imaging revealed that focal axonal swelling, but not overt fragmentation, usually preceded cell death. Co-expressing aSyn with a mitochondrial reporter revealed deficits in mitochondrial transport and morphology even when axons appeared overtly normal. The axon-protective protein Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) delayed axon degeneration but not cell death caused by aSyn. By contrast, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which has roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive-oxygen-species detoxification, abrogated aSyn toxicity in both the axon and the cell body. The rapid onset of axonal pathology in this system, and the relatively moderate degree of cell death, provide a new model for the study of aSyn toxicity and protection. Moreover, the accessibility of peripheral sensory axons will allow effects of aSyn to be studied in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al compartments and might have utility in screening for novel disease-modifying compounds.</p>

Zebrafish Foxi1 provides a neuronal ground state during inner ear induction preceding the Dlx3b/4b-regulated sensory lineage
<p>Vertebrate inner ear development is a complex process that involves the induction of a common territory for otic and epibranchial precursors and their subsequent segregation into otic and epibranchial cell fates. In zebrafish, the otic-epibranchial progenitor domain (OEPD) is induced by Fgf signaling in a Foxi1- and Dlx3b/4b-dependent manner, but the functional differences of Foxi1 and Dlx3b/4b in subsequent cell fate specifications within the developing inner ear are poorly understood. Based on pioneer tracking (PioTrack), a novel Cre-dependent genetic lineage tracing method, and genetic data, we show that the competence to embark on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al or sensory fate is provided sequentially and very early during otic placode induction. Loss of Foxi1 prevents <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al precursor formation without affecting hair cell specification, whereas loss of Dlx3b/4b inhibits hair cell but not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al precursor formation. Consistently, in Dlx3b/4b- and Sox9a-deficient <i>b380</i> mutants almost all otic epithelial fates are absent, including sensory hair cells, and the remaining otic cells adopt a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al fate. Furthermore, the progenitors of the anterior lateral line ganglia also arise from the OEPD in a Foxi1-dependent manner but are unaffected in the absence of Dlx3b/4b or in <i>b380</i> mutants. Thus, in addition to otic fate Foxi1 provides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al competence during OEPD induction prior to and independently of the Dlx3b/4b-mediated sensory fate of the developing inner ear.</p>

Glutamate signaling at cytoneme synapses
<p>We investigated the roles of components of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es for development of the <i>Drosophila</i> air sac primordium (ASP). The ASP, an epithelial tube, extends specialized signaling filopodia called cytonemes that take up signals such as Dpp (Decapentaplegic, a homolog of the vertebrate bone morphogenetic protein) from the wing imaginal disc. Dpp signaling in the ASP was compromised if disc cells lacked Synaptobrevin and Synaptotagmin-1 (which function in vesicle transport at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es), the glutamate transporter, and a voltage-gated calcium channel, or if ASP cells lacked Synaptotagmin-4 or the glutamate receptor GluRII. Transient elevations of intracellular calcium in ASP cytonemes correlate with signaling activity. Calcium transients in ASP cells depend on GluRII, are activated by <sc>l</sc>-glutamate and by stimulation of an optogenetic ion channel expressed in the wing disc, and are inhibited by EGTA and by the GluR inhibitor NASPM (1-naphthylacetyl spermine trihydrochloride). Activation of GluRII is essential but not sufficient for signaling. Cytoneme-mediated signaling is glutamatergic.</p>

Reprogrammed cells could tackle brain damage
<p>Last week, researchers at the annual Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego, California, presented progress on a new strategy for repairing injured or diseased brains: reprogramming abundant non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al cells called astrocytes into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. Several groups have successfully prompted this cellular transformation in the brains of living mice. Now, labs are turning to the next questions: Do these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s function like those that have been lost, and does creating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s at the expense of astrocytes do brain-damaged animals any good? Many researchers remain skeptical on both counts. But three groups shared evidence that reprogrammed astrocytes do, at least in some respects, impersonate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s they're meant to replace. And two of them shared findings suggesting reprogrammed astrocytes help mice recover movement lost after a stroke.</p>

A gut-brain neural circuit for nutrient sensory transduction
<p>The brain is thought to sense gut stimuli only via the passive release of hormones. This is because no connection has been described between the vagus and the putative gut epithelial sensor cell—the enteroendocrine cell. However, these electrically excitable cells contain several features of epithelial transducers. Using a mouse model, we found that enteroendocrine cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e with vagal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s to transduce gut luminal signals in milliseconds by using glutamate as a neurotransmitter. These synaptically connected enteroendocrine cells are referred to henceforth as neuropod cells. The neuroepithelial circuit they form connects the intestinal lumen to the brainstem in one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e, opening a physical conduit for the brain to sense gut stimuli with the temporal precision and topographical resolution of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e.</p>

Endothelial Dab1 signaling orchestrates neuro-glia-vessel communication in the central nervous system
<p>The architecture of the neurovascular unit (NVU) is controlled by the communication of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, glia, and vascular cells. We found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al guidance cue reelin possesses proangiogenic activities that ensure the communication of endothelial cells (ECs) with the glia to control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al migration and the establishment of the blood-brain barrier in the mouse brain. Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and Disabled1 (Dab1) expressed in ECs are required for vascularization of the retina and the cerebral cortex. Deletion of Dab1 in ECs leads to a reduced secretion of laminin-α4 and decreased activation of integrin-β1 in glial cells, which in turn control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al migration and barrier properties of the NVU. Thus, reelin signaling in the endothelium is an instructive and integrative cue essential for neuro-glia-vascular communication.</p>

The hippocampal engram maps experience but not place
<p>Episodic memories are encoded by a sparse population of hippocampal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. In mice, optogenetic manipulation of this memory engram established that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s are indispensable and inducing for memory recall. However, little is known about their in vivo activity or precise role in memory. We found that during memory encoding, only a fraction of CA1 place cells function as engram <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, distinguished by firing repetitive bursts paced at the theta frequency. During memory recall, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s remained highly context specific, yet demonstrated preferential remapping of their place fields. These data demonstrate a dissociation of precise spatial coding and contextual indexing by distinct hippocampal ensembles and suggest that the hippocampal engram serves as an index of memory content.</p>

Crystallizing a memory
<p>What is the physical basis of memory? What does it take to retrieve a memory in the brain? What would it take to activate or erase memories? In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to denote the physical manifestation of a memory in the brain (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb posited a physiological correlate for learning and recollection: The process of learning strengthens the connections, or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es, between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, which leads to the development of brain-wide cell assemblies that undergo changes in their structural and functional connectivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these assemblies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during learning (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent memories are formed, the dynamics of these assemblies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the brain processes the variety of memories an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the brain and modulate them in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate memories to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

Evolution of pallium, hippocampus, and cortical cell types revealed by single-cell transcriptomics in reptiles
<p>Computations in the mammalian cortex are carried out by glutamatergic and γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing (GABAergic) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s forming specialized circuits and areas. Here we asked how these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and areas evolved in amniotes. We built a gene expression atlas of the pallium of two reptilian species using large-scale single-cell messenger RNA sequencing. The transcriptomic signature of glutamatergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in reptilian cortex suggests that mammalian neocortical layers are made of new cell types generated by diversification of ancestral gene-regulatory programs. By contrast, the diversity of reptilian cortical GABAergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s indicates that the inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> classes known in mammals already existed in the common ancestor of all amniotes.</p>

Near-infrared deep brain stimulation via upconversion nanoparticle–mediated optogenetics
<p>Optogenetics has revolutionized the experimental interrogation of neural circuits and holds promise for the treatment of neurological disorders. It is limited, however, because visible light cannot penetrate deep inside brain tissue. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) absorb tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light and emit wavelength-specific visible light. Here, we demonstrate that molecularly tailored UCNPs can serve as optogenetic actuators of transcranial NIR light to stimulate deep brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. Transcranial NIR UCNP-mediated optogenetics evoked dopamine release from genetically tagged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in the ventral tegmental area, induced brain oscillations through activation of inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in the medial septum, silenced seizure by inhibition of hippocampal excitatory cells, and triggered memory recall. UCNP technology will enable less-invasive optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al activity manipulation with the potential for remote therapy.</p>

Social place-cells in the bat hippocampus
<p>Social animals have to know the spatial positions of conspecifics. However, it is unknown how the position of others is represented in the brain. We designed a spatial observational-learning task, in which an observer bat mimicked a demonstrator bat while we recorded hippocampal dorsal-CA1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from the observer bat. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al subpopulation represented the position of the other bat, in allocentric coordinates. About half of these “social place-cells” represented also the observer’s own position—that is, were place cells. The representation of the demonstrator bat did not reflect self-movement or trajectory planning by the observer. Some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s represented also the position of inanimate moving objects; however, their representation differed from the representation of the demonstrator bat. This suggests a role for hippocampal CA1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in social-spatial cognition.</p>

Topological and modality-specific representation of somatosensory information in the fly brain
<p>Insects and mammals share similarities of neural organization underlying the perception of odors, taste, vision, sound, and gravity. We observed that insect somatosensation also corresponds to that of mammals. In <i>Drosophila</i>, the projections of all the somatosensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> types to the insect’s equivalent of the spinal cord segregated into modality-specific layers comparable to those in mammals. Some sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s innervate the ventral brain directly to form modality-specific and topological somatosensory maps. Ascending inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s with dendrites in matching layers of the nerve cord send axons that converge to respective brain regions. Pathways arising from leg somatosensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s encode distinct qualities of leg movement information and play different roles in ground detection. Establishment of the ground pattern and genetic tools for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al manipulation should provide the basis for elucidating the mechanisms underlying somatosensation.</p>

Gating of social reward by oxytocin in the ventral tegmental area
<p>The reward generated by social interactions is critical for promoting prosocial behaviors. Here we present evidence that oxytocin (OXT) release in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key node of the brain’s reward circuitry, is necessary to elicit social reward. During social interactions, activity in paraventricular nucleus (PVN) OXT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s increased. Direct activation of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in the PVN or their terminals in the VTA enhanced prosocial behaviors. Conversely, inhibition of PVN OXT axon terminals in the VTA decreased social interactions. OXT increased excitatory drive onto reward-specific VTA dopamine (DA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. These results demonstrate that OXT promotes prosocial behavior through direct effects on VTA DA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, thus providing mechanistic insight into how social interactions can generate rewarding experiences.</p>

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience. As explosions pattern the sky, the visual system must capture information about the time-varying positions, colors, and contrasts of myriad spots of light. This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural circuits that map visual space. To generate this retinotopy (visual mapping), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved? The molecules that regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al differentiation have been described in detail, as have the cues that allow differentiated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s to reach and choose their synaptic partners (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, the mechanisms that coordinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al specification with the development of retinotopic circuit wiring have remained elusive. On page 886 of this issue, Fernandes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that in the visual system of flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), photoreceptors use glial cells as intermediaries to communicate with their neural targets to generate retinotopic circuits.</p>

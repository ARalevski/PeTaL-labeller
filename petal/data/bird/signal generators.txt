Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s could enable engineering of powerful new cellular behaviors. Rational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> design would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> architectures. In this study, we show that engineered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e regulatory cascades, binary logic gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally designed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene. Because CHOMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s can perform complex functions yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic integration, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> engineering for biotechnological applications.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator is different from the average plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Profiling the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force in B cell activation
<p>B lymphocytes use B cell receptors (BCRs) to recognize membrane-bound antigens to further initiate cell spreading and contraction responses during B cell activation. We combined traction force microscopy and live-cell imaging to profile the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion in these responses. We showed that B cell activation required the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of 10 to 20 nN of traction force when encountering antigens presented by substrates with stiffness values from 0.5 to 1 kPa, which mimic the rigidity of antigen-presenting cells in vivo. Perturbation experiments revealed that F-actin remodeling and myosin- and dynein-mediated contractility contributed to traction force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion and B cell activation. Moreover, membrane-proximal BCR signaling molecules (including Lyn, Syk, Btk, PLC-γ2, BLNK, and Vav3) and adaptor molecules (Grb2, Cbl, and Dok-3) linking BCR microclusters and motor proteins were also required for the sustained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of these traction forces. We found a positive correlation between the strength of the traction force and the mean fluorescence intensity of the BCR microclusters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that isotype-switched memory B cells expressing immunoglobulin G (IgG)–BCRs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed greater traction forces than did mature naive B cells expressing IgM-BCRs during B cell activation. Last, we observed that primary B cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed greater traction forces than did B cells from healthy donors in response to antigen stimulation. Together, these data delineate the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force during B cell activation.</p>

SOX17 Regulates Conversion of Human Fibroblasts Into Endothelial Cells and Erythroblasts by Dedifferentiation Into CD34<sup>+</sup> Progenitor Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying the dedifferentiation and lineage conversion of adult human fibroblasts into functional endothelial cells have not yet been fully defined. Furthermore, it is not known whether fibroblast dedifferentiation recapitulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of multipotent progenitors during embryonic development, which give rise to endothelial and hematopoietic cell lineages.

Implantation of these human bipotential CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice resulted in the formation of microvessels derived from human fibroblasts perfused with mouse and human erythrocytes.

Complex signal processing in synthetic gene circuits using cooperative regulatory assemblies
<p>Eukaryotic genes are regulated by multivalent transcription factor complexes. Through cooperative self-assembly, these complexes perform nonlinear regulatory operations involved in cellular decision-making and signal processing. In this study, we apply this design principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative assemblies can program nonlinear gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying the strength and number of assembly subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and nonlinear regulatory responses for single- and multi-input <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s. We demonstrate that assemblies can be adjusted to control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> dynamics. We harness this capability to engineer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s that perform dynamic filtering, enabling frequency-dependent decoding in cell populations. Programmable cooperative assembly provides a versatile way to tune the nonlinearity of network connections, markedly expanding the engineerable behaviors available to synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.</p>

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator
<p>In metals, orbital motions of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in magnetic fields, which is manifested by quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in electrical resistivity. This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here, we report a notable exception in an insulator—ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB<sub>12</sub>). The resistivity of YbB<sub>12</sub>, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in metals, exhibits distinct quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations. These unconventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations arise from the insulating bulk, even though the temperature dependence of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lation amplitude follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of metals with a large effective mass.

Glia put visual map in sync

To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e this retinotopy (visual mapping), neurons must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved?

However, the mechanisms that coordinate neuronal specification with the development of retinotopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> wiring have remained elusive.

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>latory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

A coupled-clock system drives the automaticity of human sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells
<p>The spontaneous rhythmic action potentials <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker in the heart, dictate the regular and optimal cardiac contractions that pump blood around the body. Although the heart rate of humans is substantially slower than that of smaller experimental animals, current perspectives on the biophysical mechanisms underlying the automaticity of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells (SANCs) have been gleaned largely from studies of animal hearts. Using human SANCs, we demonstrated that spontaneous rhythmic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> clock were coupled to electrogenic surface membrane molecules (the M clock) to trigger rhythmic action potentials, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup>–cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling regulated clock coupling. When these clocks became uncoupled, SANCs failed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e spontaneous action potentials, showing a depolarized membrane potential and disorganized local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases that failed to activate the M clock. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, which increases cAMP concentrations and clock coupling in other species, restored spontaneous, rhythmic action potentials in some nonbeating “arrested” human SANCs by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and synchronizing diastolic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases. When β-AR stimulation was withdrawn, the clocks again became uncoupled, and SANCs reverted to a nonbeating arrested state. Thus, automaticity of human pacemaker cells is driven by a coupled-clock system driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling. Extreme clock uncoupling led to failure of spontaneous action potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion, which was restored by recoupling of the clocks. Clock coupling and action potential firing in some of these arrested cells can be restored by β-AR stimulation–induced augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling.</p>

Splenic leukocytes define the resolution of inflammation in heart failure
<p>Inflammation promotes healing in myocardial infarction but, if unresolved, leads to heart failure. To define the inflammatory and resolving responses, we quantified leukocyte trafficking and specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) in the infarcted left ventricle and spleen after myocardial infarction, with the goal of distinguishing inflammation from its resolution. Our data suggest that the spleen not only served as a leukocyte reservoir but also was the site where SPMs were actively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed after coronary ligation in mice. Before myocardial infarction, SPMs were more abundant in the spleen than in the left ventricle. At day 1 after coronary ligation, the spleen was depleted of leukocytes, a phenomenon that was associated with greater numbers of leukocytes in the infarcted left ventricle and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of SPMs at the same site, particularly resolvins, maresin, lipoxins, and protectin. In addition, the infarcted left ventricle showed increased expression of genes encoding lipoxygenases and enhanced production of SPMs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by these enzymes. We found that macrophages were necessary for SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. The abundance of SPMs in the spleen before myocardial infarction and increased SPM concentrations in the infarcted left ventricle within 24 hours after myocardial infarction were temporally correlated with the resolution of inflammation. Thus, the acute inflammatory response coincided with the active resolving phase in post–myocardial infarction and suggests that further investigation into macrophage-derived SPMs in heart failure is warranted.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser

However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin lasers.

In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon.

Calibrated mitotic oscillator drives motile ciliogenesis
<p>Cell division and differentiation depend on massive and rapid organelle remodeling. The mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator, centered on the cyclin-dependent kinase 1–anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (CDK1-APC/C) axis, spatiotemporally coordinates this reorganization in dividing cells. Here we discovered that nondividing cells could also implement this mitotic clocklike regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> to orchestrate subcellular reorganization associated with differentiation. We probed centriole amplification in differentiating mouse-brain multiciliated cells. These postmitotic progenitors fine-tuned mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator activity to drive the orderly progression of centriole production, maturation, and motile ciliation while avoiding the mitosis commitment threshold. Insufficient CDK1 activity hindered differentiation, whereas excessive activity accelerated differentiation yet drove postmitotic progenitors into mitosis. Thus, postmitotic cells can redeploy and calibrate the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator to uncouple cytoplasmic from nuclear dynamics for organelle remodeling associated with differentiation.</p>

Visualizing Embolism Propagation in Gas-Injected Leaves

Using optical light transmission, we visualized embolism propagation in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves injected with positive gas pressure. This resulted in a rapid, stepwise reduction of transmitted light, identical to that observed during leaf dehydration, confirming that the optical method detects gas bubbles and provides insights into the air-seeding hypothesis. In red oak, xylem VCs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed using gas injection were similar to those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed using bench dehydration, but indicated 50% loss of conductivity at lower tension (∼0.4 MPa) in grapevine. In determining VC, this method eliminates the need to ascertain xylem tension, thus avoiding potential errors in water potential estimations. It is also much faster (1 h per VC). However, severing the petiole and applying high-pressure gas could affect air-seeding and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed VC.

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator period are thought to adjust the timing of biological activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the dynamic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the dynamic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of biological events. Our data provide insight into how the dynamic period adjustment of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

Consensus Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Key Regulators of Flower and Fruit Development in Wild Strawberry
<p>The diploid strawberry, <i>Fragaria vesca</i>, is a developing model system for the economically important Rosaceae family.

To investigate strawberry fruit development, we previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed spatial and temporal transcriptome data profiling <i>F. vesca</i> flower and fruit development pre- and postfertilization. In this study, we combined 46 of our existing RNA-seq libraries to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e coexpression networks using the Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis package in R. We then applied a post-hoc consensus clustering approach and used bootstrapping to demonstrate consensus clustering’s ability to produce robust and reproducible clusters. Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the networks, including increased iron transport from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene. To increase their utility, the networks are presented in a web interface (<ext-link>www.fv.rosaceaefruits.org</ext-link>) for easy exploration and identification of coexpressed genes.

The Arabidopsis DNA Methylome Is Stable under Transgenerational Drought Stress
<p>Improving the responsiveness, acclimation, and memory of plants to abiotic stress holds substantive potential for improving agriculture. An unresolved question is the involvement of chromatin marks in the memory of agriculturally relevant stresses. Such potential has spurred numerous investigations yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust stress-induced DNA methylation variation can underpin stress memory. Using a slow-onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we investigated the malleability of the DNA methylome to drought stress within a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion and under repeated drought stress over five successive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ions. While drought-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected within a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion, they did not correlate with drought-responsive gene expression. Six traits were analyzed for trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ional stress memory, and the descendants of drought-stressed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion removed from stress. With respect to trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ional drought stress, there were negligible conserved differentially methylated regions in drought-exposed lineages compared with unstressed lineages. Instead, the majority of observed variation was tied to stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the experience of repeated drought stress was not observed to influence trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ional epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that, while trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ional memory is observed in one of six traits examined, they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to drought stress.</p>

The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of photosynthesis, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from photosynthesis also feeds back to regulate the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by stabilizing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the stability of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral suppressors of RNA silencing induce developmental defects similar to those caused by mutations in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral suppressor-mediated developmental defects to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental defects in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral suppressors were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> mutation. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral suppressor-mediated developmental defects, using two independent <i>arf8</i> mutations and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral suppressor of silencing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the phenotype in the F2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. However, the loss of phenotype in the F2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent loss-of-function point mutation, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ions. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental defects caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

Cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness is associated with diapause, but not the non-diapause developmental pathway, in the blow fly <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Predicting insect responses to global climate change involves understanding cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion effects of temperature. The majority of temperate insects overwinter in a state of diapause, a pre-emptive response to winter conditions associated with increased cold hardiness. Diapause is often induced following maternal adult detection of an environmental cue signifying the onset of winter, whilst diapause is initiated in a subsequent life stage and/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. Continued global warming will expose adults to higher late-autumn temperatures, whilst diapause life stages will still experience prolonged winter cold. The cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion effect of temperature was investigated by acclimating adult <i>Calliphora vicina</i> to present-day (15°C) and future (20°C) late-autumn conditions and assessing cold-hardiness in diapause (D15 and D20) and non-diapause (ND15 and ND20) progeny. A cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion plasticity in cold hardiness was associated with D but not ND larvae. D15 larvae exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress internal freezing (supercooling point=−18.9±0.9°C) compared with D20 (−15.3±0.8°C), and displayed a greater tolerance of prolonged exposure to −4°C (LT<sub>50</sub>=26.0±1.0 and 11.4±1.1 days, respectively) and −8°C (5.1±1.1 and 3.0±1.1 days, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduced glucose content in D15 (2.4±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) compared with D20 (3.0±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) larvae. In conclusion, <i>C. vicina</i> adults exposed to warmer autumn conditions during diapause induction will produce larvae with a reduced cold hardiness capacity, which could negatively impact winter survival. Given that maternal regulation of diapause is common among temperate insects, this could be a widespread phenomenon.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>es fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>es a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ing water motion by mouth suction.</p>

Functional changes of AMPA responses in human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neural progenitors in fragile X syndrome
<p>Altered neuronal network formation and function involving dysregulated excitatory and inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s are associated with fragile X syndrome (FXS). We examined functional maturation of the excitatory transmission system in FXS by investigating the response of FXS patient–derived neural progenitor cells to the glutamate analog (AMPA). Neural progenitors derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed from boys with FXS had augmented intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to AMPA and kainate that were mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) lacking the GluA2 subunit. Together with the enhanced differentiation of glutamate-responsive cells, the proportion of CP-AMPAR and <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor–coexpressing cells was increased in human FXS progenitors. Differentiation of cells lacking GluA2 was also increased and paralleled the increased inward rectification in neural progenitors derived from <i>Fmr1</i>-knockout mice (the FXS mouse model). Human FXS progenitors had increased the expression of the precursor and mature forms of miR-181a, a microRNA that represses translation of the transcript encoding GluA2. Blocking GluA2-lacking, CP-AMPARs reduced the neurite length of human iPSC-derived control progenitors and further reduced the shortened length of neurites in human FXS progenitors, supporting the contribution of CP-AMPARs to the regulation of progenitor differentiation. Furthermore, we observed reduced expression of <i>Gria2</i> (the GluA2-encoding gene) in the frontal lobe of FXS mice, consistent with functional changes of AMPARs in FXS. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through CP-AMPARs may increase the vulnerability and affect the differentiation and migration of distinct cell populations, which may interfere with normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> formation in FXS.</p>

Networks of enzymatically oxidized membrane lipids support calcium-dependent coagulation factor binding to maintain hemostasis
<p>Blood coagulation functions as part of the innate immune system by preventing bacterial invasion, and it is critical to stopping blood loss (hemostasis). Coagulation involves the external membrane surface of activated platelets and leukocytes. Using lipidomic, genetic, biochemical, and mathematical modeling approaches, we found that enzymatically oxidized phospholipids (eoxPLs) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by the activity of leukocyte or platelet lipoxygenases (LOXs) were required for normal hemostasis and promoted coagulation factor activities in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phosphatidylserine (PS)–dependent manner. In wild-type mice, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid–phospholipids (HETE-PLs) enhanced coagulation and restored normal hemostasis in clotting-deficient animals genetically lacking p12-LOX or 12/15-LOX activity. Murine platelets <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed 22 eoxPL species, all of which were missing in the absence of p12-LOX. Humans with the thrombotic disorder antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) had statistically significantly increased HETE-PLs in platelets and leukocytes, as well as greater HETE-PL immunoreactivity, than healthy controls. HETE-PLs enhanced membrane binding of the serum protein β2GP1 (β2-glycoprotein 1), an event considered central to the autoimmune reactivity responsible for APS symptoms. Correlation network analysis of 47 platelet eoxPL species in platelets from APS and control subjects identified their enzymatic origin and revealed a complex network of regulation, with the abundance of 31 p12-LOX–derived eoxPL molecules substantially increased in APS. In summary, circulating blood cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e networks of eoxPL molecules, including HETE-PLs, which change membrane properties to enhance blood coagulation and contribute to the excessive clotting and immunoreactivity of patients with APS.</p>

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

Observation and stabilization of photonic Fock states in a hot radio-frequency resonator
<p>Detecting weak radio-frequency electromagnetic fields plays a crucial role in a wide range of fields, from radio astronomy to nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. In quantum optics, the ultimate limit of a weak field is a single photon. Detecting and manipulating single photons at megahertz frequencies presents a challenge because, even at cryogenic temperatures, thermal fluctuations are appreciable. Using a gigahertz superconducting qubit, we observed the quantization of a megahertz radio-frequency resonator, cooled it to the ground state, and stabilized Fock states. Releasing the resonator from our control, we observed its rethermalization with nanosecond resolution.

Assembling human brain organoids
<p>Brain development is a remarkable self-organization process in which cells proliferate, differentiate, migrate, and wire to form functional neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s. In humans, this process takes place over a long fetal phase and continues into the postnatal period, but it is largely inaccessible for direct, functional investigation at a cellular level. Therefore, the features that make the human central nervous system unique and the sequence of molecular and cellular events underlying brain disorders remain largely uncharted. Human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells, including those obtained by reprogramming somatic cells, have the ability to self-organize and differentiate when grown in three-dimensional (3D) aggregates rather than in direct contact with a flat plastic surface (<i>1</i>). Such 3D neural cultures, also known as organoids and organ spheroids, recapitulate many aspects of human brain development in vitro (<i>1</i>) and have the potential to accelerate progress in human neurobiology. Here, I discuss the emerging approaches to produce brain assembloids—the next <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of brain organoids that combine multiple cell lineages in 3D.

Additionally, Joglekar <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) provide evidence that the prefrontal cortex is important for igniting neural networks that contribute to visual signal processing.

History of winning remodels thalamo-PFC circuit to reinforce social dominance

Reports of proteasome-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed spliced epitopes exist, but they have been regarded as rare events. Here, however, we show that the proteasome-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed spliced peptide pool accounts for one-third of the entire HLA class I immunopeptidome in terms of diversity and one-fourth in terms of abundance. This pool also represents a unique set of antigens, possessing particular and distinguishing features. We validated this observation using a range of complementary experimental and bioinformatics approaches, as well as multiple cell types. The widespread appearance and abundance of proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing events has implications for immunobiology and autoimmunity theories and may provide a previously untapped source of epitopes for use in vaccines and cancer immunotherapy.</p>

A Price to Pay for Adult Neurogenesis
<p>We tend to believe that plasticity is what makes brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s adaptable to continuous changes in environmental demands and that greater brain plasticity should result in a better ability to cope with the surrounding world. To adapt to everyday life, animals explore, learn, and remember, and these tasks make use of various cortical structures, including the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus, part of the hippocampus, is a remarkable structure in that it is one of two areas of the adult mammalian brain, including the human brain, that continue to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e new neurons throughout postnatal life (<i>1</i>). It is well established that adult-born neurons integrate into preexisting neuronal networks and participate in information processing (<i>2</i>). Much evidence accumulated over the past decade supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis itself is a type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> plasticity required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory recall. The work by Akers <i>et al.</i> on page 598 of this issue (<i>3</i>) now shows that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may also promote forgetting.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e multiple myelin sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid nerve conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of myelinated nerves (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Optogenetic Dissection of Entorhinal-Hippocampal Functional Connectivity
<sec><title>From Grid to Place</title><p>Grid cells are considered one of the key sources for place-cell signals in the hippocampus. The entorhinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> also contains other functional cell types, but it is unclear which project to the place cells of the hippocampus. <bold>Zhang <i>et al.</i></bold> (10.1126/science.1232627, see the Perspective by <bold>Poucet and Sargolini</bold>) addressed this question using optogenetics and in vivo multi-electrode electrophysiology. Hippocampal cells received input from a broad spectrum of entorhinal neuronal cell types. Grid cells represented the biggest group of spatial inputs, but border cells, head-direction cells, and a large fraction of nonspatial cells also provided inputs. Thus, hippocampal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s have local mechanisms for processing specific types of functional input from the entorhinal cortex to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e place-specific signals.</p></sec>

Metabolome Analysis of Multi-Connected Biparental Chromosome Segment Substitution Line Populations
<p>Metabolomic analysis coupled with advanced genetic populations represents a powerful tool with which to investigate the plant metabolome. However, genetic analyses of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) metabolome have been conducted mainly using natural accessions or a single biparental population. Here, the flag leaves from three interconnected chromosome segment substitution line populations with a common recurrent genetic background were used to dissect rice metabolic diversity. We effectively used multiple interconnected biparental populations, constructed by introducing genomic segments into Zhenshan 97 from ACC10 (A/Z), Minghui 63 (M/Z), and Nipponbare (N/Z), to map metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTL). A total of 1,587 mQTL were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed, of which 684, 479, and 722 were obtained from the A/Z, M/Z, and N/Z chromosome segment substitution line populations, respectively, and we designated 99 candidate genes for 367 mQTL. In addition, 1,001 mQTL were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed specifically from joint linkage analysis with 25 candidate genes assigned. Several of these candidates were validated, such as <i>LOC_Os07g01020</i> for the in vivo content of pyridoxine and its derivative and <i>LOC_Os04g25980</i> for cis-zeatin glucosyltransferase activity. We propose a novel biosynthetic pathway for <i>O</i>-methylapigenin <i>C</i>-pentoside and demonstrated that <i>LOC_Os04g11970</i> encodes a component of this pathway through fine-mapping. We postulate that the methylated apigenin may confer plant disease resistance. This study demonstrates the power of using multiple interconnected populations to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e a large number of veritable mQTL. The combined results are discussed in the context of functional metabolomics and the possible features of assigned candidates underlying respective metabolites.</p>

Catastrophic Unbalanced Genome Rearrangements Cause Somatic Loss of Berry Color in Grapevine
<p>Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) color somatic variants that can be used to develop new grapevine cultivars occasionally appear associated with deletion events of uncertain origin. To understand the mutational mechanisms <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ing somatic structural variation in grapevine, we compared the Tempranillo Blanco (TB) white berry somatic variant with its black berry ancestor, Tempranillo Tinto. Whole-genome sequencing uncovered a catastrophic genome rearrangement in TB that caused the hemizygous deletion of 313 genes, including the loss of the functional copy for the <i>MYB</i> transcription factors required for anthocyanin pigmentation in the berry skin. Loss of heterozygosity and decreased copy number delimited interspersed monosomic and disomic regions in the right arm of linkage groups 2 and 5. At least 11 validated clustered breakpoints involving intrachromosomal and interchromosomal translocations between three linkage groups flanked the deleted fragments, which, according to segregation analyses, are phased in a single copy of each of the affected chromosomes. These hallmarks, along with the lack of homology between breakpoint joins and the randomness of the order and orientation of the rearranged fragments, are all consistent with a chromothripsis-like pattern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed after chromosome breakage and illegitimate rejoining. This unbalanced genome reshuffling has additional consequences in reproductive development. In TB, lack of sexual transmission of rearranged chromosomes associates with low gamete viability, which compromises fruit set and decreases fruit production. Our findings show that catastrophic genome rearrangements arise spontaneously and stabilize during plant somatic growth. These dramatic rearrangements <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e new interesting phenotypes that can be selected for the improvement of vegetatively propagated plant species.</p>

CRISPR-Cas9 Targeted Mutagenesis Leads to Simultaneous Modification of Different Homoeologous Gene Copies in Polyploid Oilseed Rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>)
<p>In polyploid species, altering a trait by random mutagenesis is highly inefficient due to gene redundancy. We have stably transformed tetraploid oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) with a CRISPR-Cas9 construct targeting two <i>ALCATRAZ</i> (<i>ALC</i>) homoeologs. <i>ALC</i> is involved in valve margin development and, thus, contributes to seed shattering from mature fruits. Knocking out <i>ALC</i> would increase shatter resistance to avoid seed loss during mechanical harvest. We obtained a transgenic T1 plant with four <i>alc</i> mutant alleles by the use of a single target sequence. All mutations were stably inherited to the T2 progeny. The T2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion was devoid of any wild-type alleles, proving that the underlying T1 was a nonchimeric double heterozygote. T-DNA and <i>ALC</i> loci were not linked, as indicated by random segregation in the T2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. Hence, we could select double mutants lacking the T-DNA already in the first offspring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. However, whole-genome sequencing data revealed at least five independent insertions of vector backbone sequences. We did not detect any off-target effects in two genome regions homologous to the target sequence. The simultaneous alteration of multiple homoeologs by CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis without any background mutations will offer new opportunities for using mutant genotypes in rapeseed breeding.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease genetics, and conservation biology. To estimate mutation rates and evaluate the effect of selection on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ions and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

The phosphorylation status of Ascl1 is a key determinant of neuronal differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of neurons from patient fibroblasts using a combination of developmentally defined transcription factors has great potential in disease modelling, as well as ultimately for use in re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion and repair. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of physiologically mature neurons <i>in vitro</i> remains problematic. Here we demonstrate the cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of a key reprogramming transcription factor, Ascl1, on multiple serine-proline sites. This multisite phosphorylation is a crucial regulator of the ability of Ascl1 to drive neuronal differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> in the developing embryo; a phosphomutant form of Ascl1 shows substantially enhanced neuronal induction activity in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos. Mechanistically, we see that this un(der)phosphorylated Ascl1 is resistant to inhibition by both cyclin-dependent kinase activity and Notch signalling, both of which normally limit its neurogenic potential. Ascl1 is a central component of reprogramming transcription factor cocktails to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e neurons from human fibroblasts; the use of phosphomutant Ascl1 in place of the wild-type protein significantly promotes neuronal maturity after human fibroblast reprogramming <i>in vitro</i>. These results demonstrate that cell-cycle-dependent post-translational modification of proneural proteins directly regulates neuronal differentiation <i>in vivo</i> during development, and that this regulatory mechanism can be harnessed to promote maturation of neurons obtained by transdifferentiation of human cells <i>in vitro</i>.</p>

Mouse models of telomere dysfunction phenocopy skeletal changes found in human age-related osteoporosis
<p>A major medical challenge in the elderly is osteoporosis and the high risk of fracture. Telomere dysfunction is a cause of cellular senescence and telomere shortening, which occurs with age in cells from most human tissues, including bone. Telomere defects contribute to the pathogenesis of two progeroid disorders characterized by premature osteoporosis, Werner syndrome and dyske<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>osis congenital. It is hypothesized that telomere shortening contributes to bone aging. We evaluated the skeletal phenotypes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> with disrupted telomere maintenance mechanisms as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s for human bone aging, including mutants in Werner helicase (<i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i>), telomerase (<i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i>) and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> double mutants. Compared with young wild-type (WT) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>, micro-computerized tomography analysis revealed that young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> have decreased trabecular bone volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, as well as increased trabecular spacing. In cortical bone, young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> have increased cortical thinning, and increased porosity relative to age-matched WT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. These trabecular and cortical changes were accele<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed with age in <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> compared with older WT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. Histological quantification of osteoblasts in aged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> showed a similar number of osteoblasts in all genotypes; however, significant decreases in osteoid, mineralization surface, mineral apposition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e and bone formation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e in older <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> bone suggest that osteoblast dysfunction is a prominent feature of precocious aging in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. Except in the <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i> single mutant, osteoclast number did not increase in any genotype. Significant alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ions in mechanical parameters (structure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> index, degree of anistrophy and moment of inertia) of the <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> femurs compared with WT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> were also observed. Young <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> had a statistically significant increase in bone-marrow fat content compared with young WT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>, which remained elevated in aged double mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants recapitulate the human bone aging phenotype and are useful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s for studying age-related osteoporosis.</p>

Elabela/Toddler Is an Endogenous Agonist of the Apelin APJ Receptor in the Adult Cardiovascular System, and Exogenous Administration of the Peptide Compensates for the Downregulation of Its Expression in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elabela/toddler (ELA) is a critical cardiac developmental peptide that acts through the G-protein–coupled apelin receptor, despite lack of sequence similarity to the established ligand apelin. Our aim was to investigate the receptor pharmacology, expression pattern, and in vivo function of ELA peptides in the adult cardiovascular system, to seek evidence for alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in which apelin signaling is downregulated, and to demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e attenuation of PAH severity with exogenous administ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion of ELA in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><i>In silico</i> docking analysis, competition binding experiments, and downstream assays were used to characterize ELA receptor binding in human heart and signaling in cells expressing the apelin receptor.

We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>. Specifically, we gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed K/B.g7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated.

These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule–1.

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 Inhibits Neointima Formation by Engaging Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Signaling

The mechanistic study indicated that IRF4 promotes KLF4 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic overexpression of KLF4 in SMCs largely reversed the neointima-promoting effect of IRF4 ablation, whereas ablation of KLF4 abolished the protective function of IRF4, indicating that the protective effects of IRF4 against neointima formation are KLF4-dependent. In addition, IRF4 promoted SMC dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF4 protects arteries against neointima formation by promoting the expression of KLF4 by directly binding to its promoter.

Interleukin-10 Inhibits Bone Marrow Fibroblast Progenitor Cell–Mediated Cardiac Fibrosis in Pressure-Overloaded Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) play a critical role in cardiac fibrosis; however, their origin in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed heart remains unclear, warranting further investigation. Recent studies suggest the contribution of bone marrow fibroblast progenitor cells (BM-FPCs) in pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis. We have previously shown that interleukin-10 (IL10) suppresses pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis; however, the role of IL10 in inhibition of BM-FPC–mediated cardiac fibrosis is not known. We hypothesized that IL10 inhibits pressure overload–induced homing of BM-FPCs to the heart and their transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts and thus attenuates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pressure overload was induced in wild-type (WT) and IL10 knockout (IL10KO) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> by transverse aortic constriction.

Green fluorescent protein costaining with α-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1α in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> suggests that myofibroblasts were derived from bone marrow after transverse aortic constriction. Finally, WT bone marrow transplantation in IL10KO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> inhibited transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac fibrosis and improved heart function. At the molecular level, IL10 treatment significantly inhibited transforming growth factor-β–induced transdifferentiation and fibrotic signaling in WT BM-FPCs in vitro. Furthermore, fibrosis-associated microRNA (miRNA) expression was highly upregulated in IL10KO-FPCs compared with WT-FPCs. Polymerase chain reaction–based selective miRNA analysis revealed that transforming growth factor-β–induced enhanced expression of fibrosis-associated miRNAs (miRNA-21, -145, and -208) was significantly inhibited by IL10.

Functional and histopathological identification of the respiratory failure in a DMSXL transgenic mouse model of myotonic dystrophy
<p>Acute and chronic respi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ory failure is one of the major and potentially life-threatening features in individuals with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).

Statistical analysis of breathing function measurements revealed a significant decrease in the most relevant respi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ory parameters in DMSXL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>, indicating impaired respi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ory function. Histological and morphometric analysis showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical changes in diaphragmatic muscle of DMSXL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>, characterized by an increase in the percentage of type I muscle fibers, the presence of central nuclei, partial denervation of end-plates (EPs) and a significant reduction in their size, shape complexity and density of acetylcholine receptors, all of which reflect a possible breakdown in communication between the diaphragmatic muscles fibers and the nerve terminals. Diaphragm muscle abnormalities were accompanied by an accumulation of mutant DMPK RNA foci in muscle fiber nuclei.

These features were not altered by the reconstitution of bone marrow cells from IDO<sup>+/+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>.

SIRT2 Acts as a Cardioprotective Deacetylase in Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical cardiac hypertrophy induced by stresses such as aging and neurohumoral activation is an independent risk factor for heart failure and is considered a target for the treatment of heart failure.

We identified the liver kinase B1 (LKB1), the major upstream kinase of AMPK, as the direct target of SIRT2. SIRT2 bound to LKB1 and deacetylated it at lysine 48, which promoted the phosphorylation of LKB1 and the subsequent activation of LKB1-AMPK signaling.

<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal adenocarcinoma and Wnt signaling in a mouse model
<p><i>Cryptosporidium</i> species are apicomplexan protozoans that are found worldwide. These parasites constitute a large risk to human and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al health. They cause self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts and a life-threatening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in immunocompromised hosts. Interestingly, <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> has been related to digestive carcinogenesis in humans. Consistent with a potential tumorigenic role of this parasite, in an original reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of chronic cryptosporidiosis based on dexamethasone-treated or untreated adult SCID <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>, we formerly reported that <i>C. parvum</i> (strains of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al and human origin) is able to induce digestive adenocarcinoma even in infections induced with very low inoculum. The aim of this study was to further characterize this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> and to explore metabolic pathways potentially involved in the development of <i>C. parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal oncogenesis. We searched for alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ions in genes or proteins commonly involved in cell cycle, differentiation or cell mig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion, such as β-catenin, <i>Apc</i>, E-cadherin, <i>Kras</i> and <i>p53</i>. After infection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with <i>C. parvum</i> we demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed immunohistochemical abnormal localization of Wnt signaling pathway components and p53. Mutations in the selected loci of studied genes were not found after high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ions in the ultrastructure of adherens junctions of the ileo-caecal neoplastic epithelia of <i>C. parvum</i>-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> were recorded using transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the Wnt signaling pathway, and particularly the cytoskeleton network, seems to be pivotal for the development of the <i>C. parvum</i>-induced neoplastic process and cell mig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion of transformed cells. Furthermore, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> is a valuable tool in understanding the host-pathogen interactions associated with the intricate infection process of this parasite, which is able to modulate host cytoskeleton activities and several host-cell biological processes and remains a significant cause of infection worldwide.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
The fraction of strongly bound cross-bridges is increased in mice that carry the myopathy-linked myosin heavy chain mutation MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>
<p>Myosinopathies have emerged as a new group of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es and are caused by mutations in genes encoding myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. One major hallmark of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es is skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of muscle fibers from <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>, which carry a mutation that provokes an L342Q change within the catalytic domain of the type IIb skeletal muscle myosin protein MYH4. Because homozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als develop rapid muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis, they must be killed by postnatal day 13, so all experiments were performed using skeletal muscles from adult heterozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als (<i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+). <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> contain MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup> expressed at 7% of the levels of the wild-type (WT) protein, and are overtly and histologically normal. However, mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized fibers revealed, upon maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, higher stiffness as well as altered meridional and equatorial reflections in <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> when compared with age-matched WT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Under rigor conditions, by contrast, no difference was observed between <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ and WT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. Altogether, these findings prove that, in adult <i>MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup></i> heterozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>, the transition from weak to strong myosin cross-bridge binding is facilitated, increasing the number of strongly attached myosin heads, thus enhancing force production. These changes are predictably exacerbated in the type IIb fibers of homozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>, in which the embryonic myosin isoform is fully replaced by MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>, leading to a hypercontraction, muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of skeletal myosinopathies.</p>

Manganese promotes the aggregation and prion-like cell-to-cell exosomal transmission of α-synuclein
<p>The aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn) is considered a key pathophysiological feature of certain neurodegene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ive disorders, collectively termed synucleinopathies. Given that a prion-like, cell-to-cell transfer of misfolded αSyn has been recognized in the spreading of αSyn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>y in synucleinopathies, we investigated the biological mechanisms underlying the propagation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e with respect to environmental neurotoxic stress. Considering the potential role of the divalent metal manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) in protein aggregation, we characterized its effect on αSyn misfolding and transmission in experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of Parkinson’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. In cultured dopaminergic neuronal cells stably expressing wild-type human αSyn, misfolded αSyn was secreted through exosomes into the extracellular medium upon Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure. These exosomes were endocytosed through caveolae into primary microglial cells, thereby mounting neuroinflammatory responses. Furthermore, Mn<sup>2+</sup>-elicited exosomes exerted a neurotoxic effect in a human dopaminergic neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> (LUHMES cells). Moreover, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis revealed that Mn<sup>2+</sup> accele<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed the cell-to-cell transmission of αSyn, resulting in dopaminergic neurotoxicity in a mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure.

Stereotaxically delivering αSyn-containing exosomes, isolated from Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated αSyn-expressing cells, into the striatum initiated Parkinsonian-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical features in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>.

Phosphorylation of amyloid precursor protein by mutant LRRK2 promotes AICD activity and neurotoxicity in Parkinson’s disease
<p>Mutations in <i>LRRK2</i>, which encodes leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, are the most common genetic cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (PD), a degene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e of the central nervous system that causes impaired motor function and, in advanced stages, dementia. Dementia is a common symptom of another neurodegene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, Alzheimer’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, and research suggests that there may be pathophysiological and genetic links between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. Aggregates of β amyloid [a protein produced through cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP)] are seen in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es and in PD patients carrying G2019S-mutant LRRK2. Using patient-derived cells, brain tissue, and PD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>, we found that LRRK2 interacted with and phosphorylated APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> within its intracellular domain (AICD). Phosphorylation of APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> promoted AICD transcriptional activity and correlated with increased nuclear abundance of AICD and decreased abundance of a dopaminergic neuron marker in cultures and brain tissue. The AICD regulates the transcription of genes involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and apoptosis. Overexpression of AICD, but not a phosphodeficient mutant (AICD<sup>T668A</sup>), increased the loss of dopaminergic neurons in older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> expressing LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup>. Moreover, the amount of Thr<sup>668</sup>-phosphorylated APP was substantially greater in postmortem brain tissue and dopaminergic neurons (gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed by reprogramming skin cells) from LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> patients than in those from healthy individuals. LRRK2 inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation of APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> in the patient-derived dopaminergic neurons and in the midbrains of LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. Thus, APP is a subst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e of LRRK2, and its phosphorylation promotes AICD function and neurotoxicity in PD.</p>

YAP-mediated mechanotransduction determines the podocyte’s response to damage
<p>Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells of the kidney filt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion barrier. They are subjected to physiological filt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion pressure and considerable mechanical strain, which can be further increased in various kidney <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. When injury causes cytoskeletal reorganization and morphological alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ions of these cells, the filt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion barrier may become compromised and allow proteins to leak into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Using time-resolved proteomics, we showed that podocyte injury stimulated the activity of the transcriptional coactivator YAP and the expression of YAP target genes in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of glomerular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e before the development of proteinuria. Although the activities of YAP and its ortholog TAZ are activated by mechanical stress in most cell types, injury reduced YAP and TAZ activity in cultured human and mouse podocyte cell lines grown on stiff subst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>es. Culturing these cells on soft matrix or inhibiting stress fiber formation recapitulated the damage-induced YAP up-regulation observed in vivo, indicating a mechanotransduction-dependent mechanism of YAP activation in podocytes. YAP overexpression in cultured podocytes increased the abundance of extracellular matrix–related proteins that can contribute to fibrosis. YAP activity was increased in mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of diabetic nephropathy, and the YAP target <i>CTGF</i> was highly expressed in renal biopsies from glomerular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e patients.

Pericardial Adipose Tissue Regulates Granulopoiesis, Fibrosis, and Cardiac Function After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The pericardial adipose tissue (AT) contains a high density of lymphoid clusters. It is unknown whether these clusters play a role in post–myocardial infarction (MI) inflammatory responses and cardiac outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lymphoid clusters were examined in epicardial AT of humans with or without coronary artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Murine pericardial lymphoid clusters were visualized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> subjected to coronary artery ligation. To study the relevance of pericardial clusters during inflammatory responses after MI, we surgically removed the pericardial AT and performed B-cell depletion and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor blockade. Leukocytes in murine hearts, pericardial AT, spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bone marrow were quantified by flow cytometry. Cannabinoid receptor CB2 (CB2<sup>–/–</sup>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> were used as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> for enhanced B-cell responses. The effect of impaired dendritic cell (DC) trafficking on pericardial AT inflammatory responses was tested in CCR7<sup>–/–</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> subjected to MI. Cardiac fibrosis and ventricular function were assessed by histology and echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified larger B-cell clusters in epicardial AT of human patients with coronary artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in comparison with controls without coronary artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Infarcted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> also had larger pericardial clusters and 3-fold upregulated numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor–producing B cells within pericardial AT, but not spleen or lymph nodes. This was associated with higher DC and T-cell counts in pericardial AT, which outnumbered DCs and T cells in lymph nodes. Analysis of DC matu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion markers, tracking experiments with fluorescently labeled cells, and use of CCR7-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> suggested that activated DCs mig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e from infarcts into pericardial AT via CCR7. B-cell depletion or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor neutralization inhibited DC and T-cell expansion within pericardial AT, and translated into reduced bone marrow granulopoiesis and cardiac neutrophil infilt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion 3 days after MI. The relevance of the pericardial AT in mediating all these effects was confirmed by removal of pericardial AT and ex vivo coculture with pericardial AT and granulocyte progenitors. Finally, enhanced fibrosis and worsened ejection fraction in CB2<sup>–/–</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> were limited by pericardial AT removal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings unveil a new mechanism by which the pericardial AT coordinates immune cell activation, granulopoiesis, and outcome after MI.</p></sec>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing is well established as a consistent feature of human heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing that include alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ions in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap junction re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">knockout mic</span></strong>e and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of DCM via Western blot analysis.

CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cells Promote the Transition From Hypertrophy to Heart Failure During Chronic Pressure Overload

Statistical Inference of Allopolyploid Species Networks in the Presence of Incomplete Lineage Sorting
<p>Polyploidy is an important speciation mechanism, particularly in land plants. Allopolyploid species are formed after hybridization between otherwise intersterile parental species. Recent theoretical progress has led to successful implementation of species tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s that take population genetic parameters into account. However, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s have not included allopolyploid hybridization and the special problems imposed when species trees of allopolyploids are inferred. Here, 2 new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s for the statistical inference of the evolutionary history of allopolyploids are evaluated using simulations and demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed on 2 empirical data sets. It is assumed that there has been a single hybridization event between 2 diploid species resulting in a genomic allotetraploid. The evolutionary history can be represented as a species network or as a multilabeled species tree, in which some pairs of tips are labeled with the same species. In one of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s (AlloppMUL), the multilabeled species tree is inferred directly. This is the simplest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> and the most widely applicable, since fewer assumptions are made. The second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> (AlloppNET) incorpo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>es the hybridization event explicitly which means that fewer parameters need to be estimated. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are implemented in the BEAST framework. Simulations show that both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are useful and that AlloppNET is more accu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e if the assumptions it is based on are valid. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed on previously analyzed data from the genera <i>Pachycladon</i> (Brassicaceae) and <i>Silene</i> (Caryophyllaceae).

DDiT4L promotes autophagy and inhibits pathological cardiac hypertrophy in response to stress
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy, in response to stimuli such as exercise, is considered adaptive and beneficial. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical cardiac hypertrophy that arises in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical stimuli such as unrestrained high blood pressure and oxidative or metabolic stress is maladaptive and may precede heart failure. We found that the transcript encoding DNA damage–inducible transcript 4-like (DDiT4L) was expressed in murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical cardiac hypertrophy but not in those of physiological cardiac hypertrophy. In cardiomyocytes, DDiT4L localized to early endosomes and promoted stress-induced autophagy through a process involving mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Exposing cardiomyocytes to various types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical stress increased the abundance of <i>DDiT4L</i>, which inhibited mTORC1 but activated mTORC2 signaling. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> with conditional cardiac-specific overexpression of DDiT4L had mild systolic dysfunction, increased baseline autophagy, reduced mTORC1 activity, and increased mTORC2 activity, all of which were reversed by suppression of transgene expression. Genetic suppression of autophagy also reversed cardiac dysfunction in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. Our data showed that DDiT4L may be an important transducer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical stress to autophagy through mTOR signaling in the heart and that DDiT4L could be therapeutically targeted in cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es in which autophagy and mTOR signaling play a major role.</p>

A small-molecule inhibitor of TRPC5 ion channels suppresses progressive kidney disease in animal models
<p>Progressive kidney <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es are often associated with scarring of the kidney’s filt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion unit, a condition called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). This scarring is due to loss of podocytes, cells critical for glomerular filt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion, and leads to proteinuria and kidney failure. Inherited forms of FSGS are caused by Rac1-activating mutations, and Rac1 induces TRPC5 ion channel activity and cytoskeletal re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing in podocytes. Whether TRPC5 activity mediates FSGS onset and progression is unknown. We identified a small molecule, AC1903, that specifically blocks TRPC5 channel activity in glomeruli of proteinuric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s. Chronic administ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion of AC1903 suppressed severe proteinuria and prevented podocyte loss in a transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of FSGS.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of stomatal behavior with a biochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calib<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed the wider applicability of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> accu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ely predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evapo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ive demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorpo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion in land surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

Balance between the two kinin receptors in the progression of experimental focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis in mice
<p>Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is one of the most important renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es related to end-stage renal failure. Bradykinin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal inflammation, whereas the role of its receptor 2 (B2RBK; also known as BDKRB2) in FSGS has not been studied. FSGS was induced in wild-type and B2RBK-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">knockout mic</span></strong>e by a single intravenous injection of Adriamycin (ADM). In order to further modulate the kinin receptors, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als were also treated with the B2RBK antagonist HOE-140 and the B1RBK antagonist DALBK. Here, we show that the blockage of B2RBK with HOE-140 protects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> from the development of FSGS, including podocyte foot process effacement and the re-establishment of slit-diaphragm-related proteins. However, B2RBK-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">knockout mic</span></strong>e were not protected from FSGS. These opposite results were due to B1RBK expression. B1RBK was upregulated after the injection of ADM and this upregulation was exacerbated in B2RBK-knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Furthermore, treatment with HOE-140 downregulated the B1RBK receptor. The blockage of B1RBK in B2RBK-knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als promoted FSGS regression, with a less-inflammatory phenotype. These results indicate a deleterious role of both kinin receptors in an FSGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> and suggest a possible cross-talk between them in the progression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, axon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>y often precedes cell death, raising the question of whether aSyn has compartment-specific toxic effects that could require early and/or independent therapeutic intervention. The relevance of axonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>y to degene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion can only be addressed through longitudinal, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of different neuronal compartments. With current imaging methods, dopaminergic neurons do not readily lend themselves to such a task in any verteb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e system. We therefore expressed human wild-type aSyn in zebrafish peripheral sensory neurons, which project elabo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e superficial axons that can be continuously imaged <i>in vivo</i>. Axonal outgrowth was normal in these neurons but, by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), many aSyn-expressing axons became dystrophic, with focal varicosities or diffuse beading. Approximately 20% of aSyn-expressing cells died by 3 dpf. Time-lapse imaging revealed that focal axonal swelling, but not overt fragmentation, usually preceded cell death. Co-expressing aSyn with a mitochondrial reporter revealed deficits in mitochondrial transport and morphology even when axons appeared overtly normal. The axon-protective protein Wallerian degene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion slow (WldS) delayed axon degene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion but not cell death caused by aSyn. By contrast, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which has roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive-oxygen-species detoxification, abrogated aSyn toxicity in both the axon and the cell body. The rapid onset of axonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>y in this system, and the relatively mode<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e degree of cell death, provide a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> for the study of aSyn toxicity and protection. Moreover, the accessibility of peripheral sensory axons will allow effects of aSyn to be studied in different neuronal compartments and might have utility in screening for novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-modifying compounds.</p>

An inducible knockout mouse to model the cell-autonomous role of PTEN in initiating endometrial, prostate and thyroid neoplasias
<p><i>PTEN</i> is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. The role of PTEN in carcinogenesis has been validated by knockout mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s. <i>PTEN</i> heterozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> develop neoplasms in multiple organs. Unfortunately, the embryonic lethality of biallelic excision of <i>PTEN</i> has inhibited the study of complete <i>PTEN</i> deletion in the development and progression of cancer. By crossing PTEN conditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">knockout mic</span></strong>e with transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER<sup>T</sup> under the control of a chicken actin promoter, we have gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed a tamoxifen-inducible mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> that allows temporal control of <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Interestingly, administ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion of a single dose of tamoxifen resulted in <i>PTEN</i> deletion mainly in epithelial cells, but not in stromal, mesenchymal or hematopoietic cells. Using the mT/mG double-fluorescent Cre reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>, we demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e that epithelial-specific <i>PTEN</i> excision was caused by differential Cre activity among tissues and cells types. Tamoxifen-induced deletion of <i>PTEN</i> resulted in extremely rapid and consistent formation of endometrial <i>in situ</i> adenocarcinoma, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and thyroid hyperplasia. We also analyzed the role of PTEN ablation in other epithelial cells, such as the tubular cells of the kidney, hepatocytes, colonic epithelial cells or bronchiolar epithelium, but those tissues did not exhibit neoplastic growth. Finally, to validate this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> as a tool to assay the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs in PTEN deficiency, we administered the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> with induced <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Everolimus dramatically reduced the progression of endometrial prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ions and significantly reduced thyroid hyperplasia. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> could be a valuable tool to study the cell-autonomous mechanisms involved in PTEN-loss-induced carcinogenesis and provides a good platform to study the effect of anti-neoplastic drugs on PTEN-negative tumors.</p>

Novel Adipokine, FAM19A5, Inhibits Neointima Formation After Injury Through Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 2
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Obesity plays crucial roles in the development of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. However, the mechanisms that link obesity and cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es remain elusive. Compelling evidence indicates that adipokines play an important role in obesity-related cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. Here, we found a new adipokine-named family with sequence similarity 19, member A5 (FAM19A5), a protein with unknown function that was predicted to be distantly related to the CC-chemokine family. We aimed to test whether adipose-derived FAM19A5 regulates vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>y on injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>DNA cloning, protein expression, purification, and N-terminal sequencing were applied to characterize FAM19A5. Adenovirus infection and siRNA transfection were performed to regulate FAM19A5 expression. Balloon and wire injury were performed in vivo on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> carotid arteries and mouse femoral arteries, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis, radioactive ligand-receptor binding assays, receptor internalization, and calcium mobilization assays were used to identify the functional receptor for FAM19A5.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We first characterized FAM19A5 as a secreted protein, and the first 43 N-terminal amino acids were the signal peptides. Both FAM19A5 mRNA and protein were abundantly expressed in the adipose tissue but were downregulated in obese <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. Overexpression of FAM19A5 markedly inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion and mig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion and neointima formation in the carotid arteries of balloon-injured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s. Accordingly, FAM19A5 silencing in adipocytes significantly promoted vascular smooth muscle cell activation. Adipose-specific FAM19A5 transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> showed greater attenuation of neointima formation compared with wild-type littermates fed with or without Western-style diet. We further revealed that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 was the functional receptor for FAM19A5, with a dissociation constant (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) of 0.634 nmol/L. Inhibition of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 or its downstream G12/13-RhoA signaling circumvented the suppressive effects of FAM19A5 on vascular smooth muscle cell prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion and mig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We revealed that a novel adipokine, FAM19A5, was capable of inhibiting postinjury neointima formation via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2-G12/13-RhoA signaling.

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ions in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac subst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart.

Targeting Transmembrane BAX Inhibitor Motif Containing 1 Alleviates Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac hypertrophy and its resultant heart failure are among the most common causes of mortality worldwide. Abnormal protein degradation, especially the impaired lysosomal degradation of large organelles and membrane proteins, is involved in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated cardiac transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 1 (TMBIM1) mRNA and protein expression levels in samples from patients with heart failure and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> with aortic banding (AB)–induced cardiac hypertrophy. We gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed cardiac-specific <i>Tmbim1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">knockout mic</span></strong>e and cardiac-specific <i>Tmbim1</i>-overexpressing transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> and then challenged them with AB surgery. We used microarray, confocal image, and coimmunoprecipitation analyses to identify the downstream targets of TMBIM1 in cardiac hypertrophy. <i>Tmbim1</i>/<i>Tlr4</i> double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">knockout mic</span></strong>e were gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed to investigate whether the effects of TMBIM1 on cardiac hypertrophy were Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent. Finally, lentivirus-mediated <i>TMBIM1</i> overexpression in a monkey AB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> was performed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of TMBIM1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>TMBIM1 expression was significantly downregulated on hypertrophic stimuli in both human and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> heart samples. Silencing cardiac <i>Tmbim1</i> aggravated AB-induced cardiac hypertrophy. This effect was blunted by <i>Tmbim1</i> overexpression. Transcriptome profiling revealed that the TLR4 signaling pathway was disrupted dramatically by manipulation of <i>Tmbim1</i>. The effects of TMBIM1 on cardiac hypertrophy were shown to be dependent on TLR4 in double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">knockout mic</span></strong>e. Fluorescent staining indicated that TMBIM1 promoted the lysosome-mediated degradation of activated TLR4. Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that TMBIM1 directly interacted with tumor susceptibility gene 101 via a PTAP motif and accele<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed the formation of multivesicular bodies that delivered TLR4 to the lysosomes.

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome

Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 proteins might identify genetic determinants of risk-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of genetic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e Risk Score–associated proteins using linear mixed-effects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s in 2 population-based cohorts.

To evaluate the utility of this st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>egy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipoprotein E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-protein associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously.

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials of bone marrow cell–based therapies after acute myocardial infarction (MI) have produced mostly neutral results. Treatment with specific bone marrow cell–derived secreted proteins may provide an alternative biological approach to improving tissue repair and heart function after MI.

Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Induces Aortic Valve Calcification by Inhibiting Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Signaling in Valvular Interstitial Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Calcification of the aortic valve leads to increased leaflet stiffness and consequently to the development of calcific aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of calcification remain unclear.

We induced osteogenic differentiation in the primary cultured VICs and examined the effects of the DPP-4 inhibitor on the osteogenic changes in vitro and aortic valve calcification in endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. We also induced calcific aortic stenosis in male New Zealand rabbits (weight, 2.5–3.0 kg) by a cholesterol-enriched diet+vitamin D2 (25 000 IU, daily).

Poly(ADP-ribose) drives pathologic α-synuclein neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ic accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) underlies Parkinson’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (PD). The molecular mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ic α-syn causes neurodegene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion in PD are not known. Here, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ic α-syn activates poly(adenosine 5′-diphosphate–ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), and PAR gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion accele<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>es the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ic α-syn, resulting in cell death via parthanatos.

In a feed-forward loop, PAR converted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ic α-syn to a more toxic strain.

Contribution of neural cell death to depressive phenotypes of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice
<p>Major depression disorder (MDD) or depression is highly prevalent in individuals with diabetes, and the depressive symptoms are more severe and less responsive to antidepressant therapies in these patients. The underlying mechanism is little understood. We hypothesized that the pathophysiology of comorbid depression was more complex than that proposed for MDD and that neural cell death played a role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e severity. To test this hypothesis, we gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> had blood glucose levels threefold above controls and exhibited depressive phenotypes as judged by a battery of behavioral tests, thus confirming the comorbidity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. Immunohistological studies showed markedly increased TUNEL-positive cells in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the comorbid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>, indicating apoptosis. This finding was supported by increased caspase-3 and decreased Bcl-2 proteins in these brain regions. In addition, the serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level of comorbid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> was reduced compared with controls, further supporting the neurodegene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ive change. Mechanistic analyses showed an increased expression of mitochondrial fission genes fission protein 1 (<i>Fis1</i>) and dynamin-related protein 1 (<i>Drp1</i>), and a decreased expression of mitochondrial fusion genes mitofusin 1 (<i>Mfn1</i>), mitofusin 2 (<i>Mfn2</i>) and optical atrophy 1 (<i>Opa1</i>). Representative assessment of the proteins Drp1 and Mfn2 mirrored the mRNA changes. The data demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed that neural cell death was associated with the depressive phenotype of comorbid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> and that a fission-dominant expression of genes and proteins mediating mitochondrial dynamics played a role in the hyperglycemia-induced cell death. The study provides new insight into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e mechanism and could aid the development of novel therapeutics aimed at providing neuroprotection by modulating mitochondrial dynamics to treat comorbid depression with diabetes.</p>

A novel mouse model of Warburg Micro syndrome reveals roles for RAB18 in eye development and organisation of the neuronal cytoskeleton
<p>Mutations in <i>RAB18</i> have been shown to cause the heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM). Individuals with WARBM present with a range of clinical symptoms, including ocular and neurological abnormalities. However, the underlying cellular and molecular pathogenesis of the disorder remains unclear, largely owing to the lack of any robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s that phenocopy both the ocular and neurological features of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. We report here the gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion and characterisation of a novel <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of WARBM. <i>Rab18</i>-mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> are viable and fertile. They present with congenital nuclear cataracts and atonic pupils, recapitulating the characteristic ocular features that are associated with WARBM. Additionally, <i>Rab18</i>-mutant cells exhibit an increase in lipid droplet size following treatment with oleic acid. Lipid droplet abnormalities are a characteristic feature of cells taken from WARBM individuals, as well as cells taken from individuals with other neurodegene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ive conditions. Neurological dysfunction is also apparent in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>, including progressive weakness of the hind limbs. We show that the neurological defects are, most likely, not caused by gross perturbations in synaptic vesicle recycling in the central or peripheral nervous system. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>her, loss of <i>Rab18</i> is associated with widespread disruption of the neuronal cytoskeleton, including abnormal accumulations of neurofilament and microtubule proteins in synaptic terminals, and gross disorganisation of the cytoskeleton in peripheral nerves. Global proteomic profiling of peripheral nerves in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> reveals significant alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ions in several core molecular pathways that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in neurons. The apparent similarities between the WARBM phenotype and the phenotype that we describe here indicate that the <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse provides an important platform for investigation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions.</p>

A new mouse model of Canavan leukodystrophy displays hearing impairment due to central nervous system dysmyelination
<p>Canavan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is a leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the <i>ASPA</i> gene. This gene encodes the enzyme that converts N-acetylaspartate into acetate and aspartic acid. In Canavan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, spongiform encephalopathy of the brain causes progressive mental retardation, motor deficit and death. We have isolated a mouse with a novel ethylnitrosourea-induced mutation in <i>Aspa</i>. This mutant, named <i>deaf14</i>, carries a c.516T>A mutation that is predicted to cause a p.Y172X protein truncation. No full-length ASPA protein is produced in <i>deaf14</i> brain and there is extensive spongy degene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion. Interestingly, we found that <i>deaf14</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> have an attenuated startle in response to loud noise. The first auditory brainstem response peak has normal latency and amplitude but peaks II, III, IV and V have increased latency and decreased amplitude in <i>deaf14</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>.

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous system function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous systems, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Sepsis otopathy: experimental sepsis leads to significant hearing impairment due to apoptosis and glutamate excitotoxicity in murine cochlea
<p>Hearing loss is frequent in intensive care patients and can be due to several causes. However, sepsis has not been examined as a possible cause. The aim of this study is to assess the influence of experimental sepsis on hearing thresholds and to evaluate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical changes in the cochlea. The cecal ligation puncture technique was used to induce sepsis in 18 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. Results were compared with those from 13 sham-ope<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed and 13 untreated control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. The hearing thresholds of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als were evaluated with auditory evoked brainstem responses prior to the induction of sepsis and again at the peak of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Immediately after the second measurement, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> were sacrificed and the inner ears harvested and prepared for further evaluation. The cochleae were examined with light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry for Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> with sepsis showed a significant hearing loss but not the control groups. Induction of apoptosis could be shown in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti. Furthermore, excitotoxicity could be shown at the basal pole of the inner hair cells. In this murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, sepsis leads to significant hearing impairment. The physiological alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion could be linked to apoptosis in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti and to a disturbance of the synapses of the inner hair cells.</p>

Disturbed Flow Promotes Arterial Stiffening Through Thrombospondin-1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Arterial stiffness and wall shear stress are powerful determinants of cardiovascular health, and arterial stiffness is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality.

Gene expression and pathway analysis was performed on endothelial cell–enriched RNA and validated by immunohistochemistry. In vitro testing of signaling pathways was performed under oscillatory and laminar wall shear stress conditions.

Impaired ability of arterial phagocytes to uptake apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) promotes lesion growth and establishment of a necrotic core. The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-5 is an important modulator of myeloid function and programming. We sought to investigate whether IRF5 affects the formation and phenotype of atherosclerotic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the role of IRF5 in atherosclerosis in 2 complementary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s. First, atherosclerotic lesion development in hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> and ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> with a genetic deletion of IRF5 (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>Irf5<sup>-/-</sup>) was compared and then lesion development was assessed in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of shear stress-modulated vulnerable plaque formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both lesion and necrotic core size were significantly reduced in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>Irf5<sup>-/-</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> compared with IRF5-competent ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong>. Necrotic core size was also reduced in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of shear stress-modulated vulnerable plaque formation. A significant loss of CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages was evident in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>Irf5<sup>-/-</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mice</span></strong> in the aorta, draining lymph nodes, and bone marrow cell cultures, indicating that IRF5 maintains CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages in atherosclerosis. Moreover, we revealed that the CD11c gene is a direct target of IRF5 in macrophages. In the absence of IRF5, CD11c<sup>-</sup> macrophages displayed a significant increase in expression of the efferocytosis-regulating integrin-β3 and its ligand milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 protein and enhanced efferocytosis in vitro and in situ.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF5 is detrimental in atherosclerosis by promoting the maintenance of proinflammatory CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages within lesions and controlling the expansion of the necrotic core by impairing efferocytosis.</p></sec>

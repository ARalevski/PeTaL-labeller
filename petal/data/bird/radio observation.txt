Observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K + <sup>40</sup>K collisions
<p>Resonances in ultracold collisions involving heavy molecules are difficult to simulate theoretically and have proven challenging to detect. Here we report the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold collisions between potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K) atoms and sodium-23–potassium-40 (<sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K) molecules in the rovibrational ground state. We prepare the atoms and molecules in various hyperfine levels of their ground states and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>e the loss of molecules as a function of the magnetic field. The atom-molecule Feshbach resonances are identified by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ing an enhancement of the loss. We have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed 11 resonances in the magnetic field range of 43 to 120 gauss. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed atom-molecule Feshbach resonances at ultralow temperatures probe the three-body potential energy surface with exceptional resolution and will help to improve understanding of ultracold collisions.</p>

Problem-solving males become more attractive to female budgerigars
<p>Darwin proposed that mate choice might contribute to the evolution of cognitive abilities. An open question is whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ing the cognitive skills of an individual makes it more attractive as a mate. In this study, we demonstrated that initially less-preferred budgerigar males became preferred after females <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed that these males, but not the initially preferred ones, were able to solve extractive foraging problems. This preference shift did not occur in control experiments in which females <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed males with free access to food or in which females <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed female demonstrators solving these extractive foraging problems. Our results suggest that direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ation of problem-solving skills increases male attractiveness and that this could contribute to the evolution of the cognitive abilities underlying such skills.</p>

Social place-cells in the bat hippocampus
<p>Social animals have to know the spatial positions of conspecifics. However, it is unknown how the position of others is represented in the brain. We designed a spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ational-learning task, in which an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>er bat mimicked a demonstrator bat while we recorded hippocampal dorsal-CA1 neurons from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>er bat. A neuronal subpopulation represented the position of the other bat, in allocentric coordinates. About half of these “social place-cells” represented also the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>er’s own position—that is, were place cells. The representation of the demonstrator bat did not reflect self-movement or trajectory planning by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>er. Some neurons represented also the position of inanimate moving objects; however, their representation differed from the representation of the demonstrator bat. This suggests a role for hippocampal CA1 neurons in social-spatial cognition.</p>

Using climate models to estimate the quality of global observational data sets
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ational estimates of the climate system are essential to monitoring and understanding ongoing climate change and to assessing the quality of climate models used to produce near- and long-term climate information. This study poses the dual and unconventional question: Can climate models be used to assess the quality of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ational references? We show that this question not only rests on solid theoretical grounds but also offers insightful applications in practice. By comparing four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ational products of sea surface temperature with a large multimodel climate forecast ensemble, we find compelling evidence that models systematically score better against the most recent, advanced, but also most independent product. These results call for generalized procedures of model-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ation comparison and provide guidance for a more objective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ational data set selection.</p>

Atmospheric new particle formation from sulfuric acid and amines in a Chinese megacity
<p>Atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) is an important global phenomenon that is nevertheless sensitive to ambient conditions. According to both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ation and theoretical arguments, NPF usually requires a relatively high sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) concentration to promote the formation of new particles and a low preexisting aerosol loading to minimize the sink of new particles. We investigated NPF in Shanghai and were able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>e both precursor vapors (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and initial clusters at a molecular level in a megacity. High NPF rates were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed to coincide with several familiar markers suggestive of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>–dimethylamine (DMA)–water (H<sub>2</sub>O) nucleation, including sulfuric acid dimers and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-DMA clusters. In a cluster kinetics simulation, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed concentration of sulfuric acid was high enough to explain the particle growth to ~3 nanometers under the very high condensation sink, whereas the subsequent higher growth rate beyond this size is believed to result from the added contribution of condensing organic species. These findings will help in understanding urban NPF and its air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate secondary particle formation in China.</p>

Bumblebees show cognitive flexibility by improving on an observed complex behavior
<p>We explored bees’ behavioral flexibility in a task that required transporting a small ball to a defined location to gain a reward. Bees were pretrained to know the correct location of the ball. Subsequently, to obtain a reward, bees had to move a displaced ball to the defined location. Bees that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed demonstration of the technique from a live or model demonstrator learned the task more efficiently than did bees <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ing a “ghost” demonstration (ball moved via magnet) or without demonstration. Instead of copying demonstrators moving balls over long distances, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ers solved the task more efficiently, using the ball positioned closest to the target, even if it was of a different color than the one previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed. Such unprecedented cognitive flexibility hints that entirely novel behaviors could emerge relatively swiftly in species whose lifestyle demands advanced learning abilities, should relevant ecological pressures arise.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Genomes of Two Bat Species with Long Constant Frequency Echolocation Calls
<p>Bats can perceive the world by using a wide range of sensory systems, and some of the systems have become highly specialized, such as auditory sensory perception. Among bat species, the Old World leaf-nosed bats and horseshoe bats (rhinolophoid bats) possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems. Here, we reported the whole-genome sequencing and <i>de novo</i> assembles of two rhinolophoid bats—the great leaf-nosed bat (<i>Hipposideros armiger</i>) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus sinicus</i>). Comparative genomic analyses revealed the adaptation of auditory sensory perception in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some vision-related genes in rhinolophoid bats was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed, suggesting that these genes have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive contraction of olfactory receptor gene repertoires was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive gene contractions can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory gene might have direct consequences for genes controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population genetic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-sequenced the genome of 20 great leaf-nosed bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, evidence of genetic adaptations to high altitudes in the great leaf-nosed bats was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the evolution of bats.</p>

Can we predict which dysplastic hips will require acetabular augmentation during total hip arthroplasty based on pre-operative radiographs?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an innovative   templating technique could predict the need for acetabular augmentation   during primary total hip arthroplasty for patients with dysplastic   hips.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We developed a simple templating technique to estimate acetabular   component coverage at total hip arthroplasty, the True Cup: False   Cup (TC:FC) ratio.

Traditional radiological methods of assessing the degree of acetabular dysplasia   (Sharp’s angle, Tönnis angle, centre-edge angle) as well as the   TC:FC ratio were measured from the pre-operative radiographs. A   comparison of augmented and non-augmented hips was undertaken to   determine any difference in pre-operative radiological indices between   the two cohorts.

Counter-propagating charge transport in the quantum Hall effect regime
<p>The quantum Hall effect, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field, imposes a 1D-like chiral, downstream, transport of charge carriers along the sample edges. Although this picture remains valid for electrons and Laughlin’s fractional quasiparticles, it no longer holds for quasiparticles in the so-called hole-conjugate states. These states are expected, when disorder and interactions are weak, to harbor upstream charge modes. However, so far, charge currents were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed to flow exclusively downstream in the quantum Hall regime. Studying the canonical spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized <i>v</i> = 2/3 hole-like states in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed a significant upstream charge current at short propagation distances in the spin unpolarized state.</p>

A dust-enshrouded tidal disruption event with a resolved radio jet in a galaxy merger

Multimessenger observations of a flaring blazar coincident with high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A
<p>Previous detections of individual astrophysical sources of neutrinos are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy neutrino, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera–electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays.

This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray–emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.</p>

The arms extend to the disk outer regions and can be traced down to the midplane.

Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular plants. Resurrection plants have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the land plant phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed across resurrection plant lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection plant genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection plants convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection plants and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed for most resurrection plants. Together, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in land plants through tandem gene duplication.</p>

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool, which enable the interpretation of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed transcriptomic change (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional impact for biological processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our perception of the functional impacts of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the biological significance of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed DEGs using established biological concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on biological processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA. The PAIR version 5.0-inferred interactome and GSLA Web tool both can be accessed at <ext-link>http://public.synergylab.cn/pair/</ext-link>.</p>

Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust stress-induced DNA methylation variation can underpin stress memory. Using a slow-onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we investigated the malleability of the DNA methylome to drought stress within a generation and under repeated drought stress over five successive generations. While drought-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected within a generation, they did not correlate with drought-responsive gene expression. Six traits were analyzed for transgenerational stress memory, and the descendants of drought-stressed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one generation removed from stress. With respect to transgenerational drought stress, there were negligible conserved differentially methylated regions in drought-exposed lineages compared with unstressed lineages. Instead, the majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed variation was tied to stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the experience of repeated drought stress was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed to influence transgenerational epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that, while transgenerational memory is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in one of six traits examined, they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to drought stress.</p>

Impaired Malate and Fumarate Accumulation Due to the Mutation of the Tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter Has Little Effects on Stomatal Behavior
<p>Malate is a central metabolite involved in a multiplicity of plant metabolic pathways, being associated with mitochondrial metabolism and playing significant roles in stomatal movements. Vacuolar malate transport has been characterized at the molecular level and is performed by at least one carrier protein and two channels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) vacuoles. The absence of the Arabidopsis tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter (tDT) in the <i>tdt</i> knockout mutant was associated previously with an impaired accumulation of malate and fumarate in leaves. Here, we investigated the consequences of this lower accumulation on stomatal behavior and photosynthetic capacity as well as its putative metabolic impacts. Neither the stomatal conductance nor the kinetic responses to dark, light, or high CO<sub>2</sub> were highly affected in <i>tdt</i> plants. In addition, we did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>e any impact on stomatal aperture following incubation with abscisic acid, malate, or citrate. Furthermore, an effect on photosynthetic capacity was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in the mutant lines. However, leaf mitochondrial metabolism was affected in the <i>tdt</i> plants. Levels of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were altered, and increases in both light and dark respiration were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed. We conclude that manipulation of the tonoplastic organic acid transporter impacted mitochondrial metabolism, while the overall stomatal and photosynthetic capacity were unaffected.</p>

Heteroblastic Development of Transfer Cells Is Controlled by the microRNA miR156/SPL Module
<p>We report that wall ingrowth deposition in phloem parenchyma (PP) transfer cells (TCs) in leaf veins of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) represents a novel trait of heteroblasty. Development of PP TCs involves extensive deposition of wall ingrowths adjacent to cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. These PP TCs potentially facilitate phloem loading by enhancing efflux of symplasmic Suc for subsequent active uptake into cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. PP TCs with extensive wall ingrowths are ubiquitous in mature cotyledons and juvenile leaves, but dramatically less so in mature adult leaves, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ation consistent with PP TC development reflecting vegetative phase change (VPC) in Arabidopsis. Consistent with this conclusion, the abundance of PP TCs with extensive wall ingrowths varied across rosette development in three ecotypes displaying differing durations of juvenile phase, and extensive deposition of wall ingrowths was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in rejuvenated leaves following prolonged defoliation. PP TC development across juvenile, transition, and adult leaves correlated positively with levels of miR156, a major regulator of VPC in plants, and corresponding changes in wall ingrowth deposition were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed when miR156 was overexpressed or its activity suppressed by target mimicry. Analysis of plants carrying miR156-resistant forms of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> (<i>SPL</i>) genes showed that wall ingrowth deposition was increased in <i>SPL9</i>-group but not <i>SPL3</i>-group genes, indicating that <i>SPL9</i>-group genes may function as negative regulators of wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs. Collectively, our results point to wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs being under control of the genetic program regulating VPC.</p>

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem hydraulic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage loss of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its hydraulic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Does tantalum exhibit any intrinsic antimicrobial or antibiofilm properties?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tantalum (Ta) trabecular metal components are increasingly used   to reconstruct major bone defects in revision arthroplasty surgery.   It is known that some metals such as silver have antibacterial properties.   Recent reports have raised the question regarding whether Ta components   are protective against infection in revision surgery.

After serial dilution, colony forming units (cfu) were quantified   on Mueller-Hinton agar plates. In order to establish whether biofilms   formed to a greater extent on one material than the other, these   Ta and Ti pieces were then washed twice, sonicated and washed again   to remove loosely adhered planktonic bacteria.

Complete data were available for 73 patients   (42 with OFD; ten with an OFD-like adamantinoma and 21 with an adamantinoma).   The mean follow-up was 10.3 years (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 years (3.0   to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 years (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at diagnosis for OFD was 13.5 years (1 to 49), 10.5   years (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 years (14 to 86) for adamantinoma.   A total of 24 of the 42 patients with OFD (57%) have not required   any treatment and have been managed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ation. A total of   18 of the 42 patients with OFD underwent surgery, 13 with curettage   and five with resection. In all, three patients developed recurrence   following curettage (23%) but none following resection. All these   patients were cured with further limited surgery. A total of six   patients initially diagnosed with OFD were subsequently found to   have OFD-like adamantinoma. Of the ten patients initially diagnosed   with OFD-like adamantinoma, three (30%) were managed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ation   alone and seven underwent surgery, two with curettage and five with   resection. Local recurrence arose in two patients, one each after   curettage and resection. No patients with either OFD or an OFD-like   adamantinoma developed metastases or had progression to adamantinoma.   All patients with an adamantinoma were treated by surgery, three   with curettage, six with amputation and 12 with excision. In all,   two of the three treated with curettage developed local recurrence, requiring   further surgery.

The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   rotation, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral rotation and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau. This method evaluates the femur medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   rotation.

Diagnostic Accuracy of the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score Plus D-Dimer for Acute Aortic Syndromes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are rare and severe cardiovascular emergencies with unspecific symptoms. For AASs, both misdiagnosis and overtesting are key concerns, and standardized diagnostic strategies may help physicians to balance these risks. D-dimer (DD) is highly sensitive for AAS but is inadequate as a stand-alone test. Integration of pretest probability assessment with DD testing is feasible, but the safety and efficiency of such a diagnostic strategy are currently unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter prospective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ational study involving 6 hospitals in 4 countries from 2014 to 2016, consecutive outpatients were eligible if they had ≥1 of the following: chest/abdominal/back pain, syncope, perfusion deficit, and if AAS was in the differential diagnosis. The tool for pretest probability assessment was the aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS, 0–3) per current guidelines. DD was considered negative (DD−) if <500 ng/mL. Final case adjudication was based on conclusive diagnostic imaging, autopsy, surgery, or 14-day follow-up. Outcomes were the failure rate and efficiency of a diagnostic strategy for ruling out AAS in patients with ADD-RS=0/DD− or ADD-RS ≤1/DD−.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1850 patients were analyzed. Of these, 438 patients (24%) had ADD-RS=0, 1071 patients (58%) had ADD-RS=1, and 341 patients (18%) had ADD-RS >1. Two hundred forty-one patients (13%) had AAS: 125 had type A aortic dissection, 53 had type B aortic dissection, 35 had intramural aortic hematoma, 18 had aortic rupture, and 10 had penetrating aortic ulcer. A positive DD test result had an overall sensitivity of 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.6–98.6) and a specificity of 64% (95% CI, 61.6–66.4) for the diagnosis of AAS; 8 patients with AAS had DD−. In 294 patients with ADD-RS=0/DD−, 1 case of AAS was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1.9) and an efficiency of 15.9% (95% CI, 14.3–17.6) for the ADD-RS=0/DD− strategy. In 924 patients with ADD-RS ≤1/DD−, 3 cases of AAS were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed.

Sex Differences and Similarities in Atrial Fibrillation Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Mortality in Community Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac disease in aging populations with high comorbidity and mortality. Sex differences in AF epidemiology are insufficiently understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In N=79 793 individuals without AF diagnosis at baseline (median age, 49.6 years; age range, 24.1–97.6 years; 51.7% women) from 4 community-based European studies (FINRISK, DanMONICA, Moli-sani Northern Sweden) of the BiomarCaRE consortium (Biomarker for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe), we examined AF incidence, its association with mortality, common risk factors, biomarkers, and prevalent cardiovascular disease, and their attributable risk by sex. Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular risk factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime risk was similar (>30%) for both sexes. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold risk of death in comparison with those without AF. Multivariable-adjusted models showed sex differences for the association of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio per standard deviation increase, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.23 in women versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25–1.38 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.001). Total cholesterol was inversely associated with incident AF with a greater risk reduction in women (hazard ratio per SD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81–0.90 versus 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.97 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.023). No sex differences were seen for C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. The population-attributable risk of all risk factors combined was 41.9% in women and 46.0% in men. About 20% of the risk was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed for body mass index.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lifetime risk of AF was high, and AF was strongly associated with increased mortality both in women and men.

Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies
<p>Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing the efficiency with which solar radiation is converted into biomass has recently become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) and irradiance was measured in five cultivars of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar radiation. This relationship differed substantially from that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed for conventional short term light response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar radiation was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. Genotypic variation in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective dissipation became greater than ETR was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, estimated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

Characterization of Class III Peroxidases from Switchgrass
<p>Class III peroxidases (CIIIPRX) catalyze the oxidation of monolignols, generate radicals, and ultimately lead to the formation of lignin. In general, CIIIPRX genes encode a large number of isozymes with ranges of in vitro substrate specificities. In order to elucidate the mode of substrate specificity of these enzymes, we characterized one of the CIIIPRXs (PviPRX9) from switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>), a strategic plant for second-generation biofuels. The crystal structure, kinetic experiments, molecular docking, as well as expression patterns of PviPRX9 across multiple tissues and treatments, along with its levels of coexpression with the majority of genes in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, revealed the function of PviPRX9 in lignification. Significantly, our study suggested that PviPRX9 has the ability to oxidize a broad range of phenylpropanoids with rather similar efficiencies, which reflects its role in the fortification of cell walls during normal growth and root development and in response to insect feeding. Based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed interactions of phenylpropanoids in the active site and analysis of kinetics, a catalytic mechanism involving two water molecules and residues histidine-42, arginine-38, and serine-71 was proposed. In addition, proline-138 and gluntamine-140 at the <sup>137</sup>P-X-P-X<sup>140</sup> motif, leucine-66, proline-67, and asparagine-176 may account for the broad substrate specificity of PviPRX9. Taken together, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations shed new light on the function and catalysis of PviPRX9 and potentially benefit efforts to improve biomass conservation properties in bioenergy and forage crops.</p>

Apparent Overinvestment in Leaf Venation Relaxes Leaf Morphological Constraints on Photosynthesis in Arid Habitats
<p>Leaf veins supply the mesophyll with water that evaporates when stomata are open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Theoretical analyses suggest that water is optimally distributed in the mesophyll when the lateral distance between veins (<i>d</i><sub>x</sub>) is equal to the distance from these veins to the epidermis (<i>d</i><sub>y</sub>), expressed as <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ≈ 1. Although this theory is supported by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations of many derived angiosperms, we hypothesize that plants in arid environments may reduce <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> below unity owing to climate-specific functional adaptations of increased leaf thickness and increased vein density. To test our hypothesis, we assembled leaf hydraulic, morphological, and photosynthetic traits of 68 species from the <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Corymbia</i> genera (termed eucalypts) along an aridity gradient in southwestern Australia. We inferred the potential gas-exchange advantage of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> using a model that links leaf morphology and hydraulics to photosynthesis. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations reveal that eucalypts in arid environments have thick amphistomatous leaves with high vein densities, resulting in <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ratios that range from 1.6 to 0.15 along the aridity gradient. Our model suggests that, as leaves become thicker, the effect of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> is to offset the reduction in leaf gas exchange that would result from maintaining <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> at unity. This apparent overinvestment in leaf venation may be explained from the selective pressure of aridity, under which traits associated with long leaf life span, high hydraulic and thermal capacitances, and high potential rates of leaf water transport confer a competitive advantage.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 extracted from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of grasses, but its specific binding target is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 binding to sequentially extracted maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily binds glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix polysaccharide in grass CWs. This binding is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 binding, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By mixing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially binds GAX. In contrast, no PRE was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the rigid fraction of GAX became more rigid upon EXPB1 binding while the dynamic fraction became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens grass CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which binds cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s target in grass CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand binding for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

Genetic Interactions between PEROXIN12 and Other Peroxisome-Associated Ubiquitination Components
<p>Most eukaryotic cells require peroxisomes, organelles housing fatty acid β-oxidation and other critical metabolic reactions. Peroxisomal matrix proteins carry peroxisome-targeting signals that are recognized by one of two receptors, PEX5 or PEX7, in the cytosol. After delivering the matrix proteins to the organelle, these receptors are removed from the peroxisomal membrane or matrix. Receptor retrotranslocation not only facilitates further rounds of matrix protein import but also prevents deleterious PEX5 retention in the membrane. Three peroxisome-associated ubiquitin-protein ligases in the Really Interesting New Gene (RING) family, PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12, facilitate PEX5 retrotranslocation. However, the detailed mechanism of receptor retrotranslocation remains unclear in plants. We identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>pex12</i> Glu-to-Lys missense allele that conferred severe peroxisomal defects, including impaired β-oxidation, inefficient matrix protein import, and decreased growth. We compared this <i>pex12-1</i> mutant to other peroxisome-associated ubiquitination-related mutants and found that RING peroxin mutants displayed elevated PEX5 and PEX7 levels, supporting the involvement of RING peroxins in receptor ubiquitination in Arabidopsis. Also, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed that disruption of any Arabidopsis RING peroxin led to decreased PEX10 levels, as seen in yeast and mammals. Peroxisomal defects were exacerbated in RING peroxin double mutants, suggesting distinct roles of individual RING peroxins. Finally, reducing function of the peroxisome-associated ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme PEX4 restored PEX10 levels and partially ameliorated the other molecular and physiological defects of the <i>pex12-1</i> mutant. Future biochemical analyses will be needed to determine whether destabilization of the RING peroxin complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in <i>pex12-1</i> stems from PEX4-dependent ubiquitination on the pex12-1 ectopic Lys residue.</p>

The Genetics of Leaf Flecking in Maize and Its Relationship to Plant Defense and Disease Resistance
<p>Physiological leaf spotting, or flecking, is a mild-lesion phenotype <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed on the leaves of several commonly used maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines and has been anecdotally linked to enhanced broad-spectrum disease resistance. Flecking was assessed in the maize nested association mapping (NAM) population, comprising 4,998 recombinant inbred lines from 25 biparental families, and in an association population, comprising 279 diverse maize inbreds. Joint family linkage analysis was conducted with 7,386 markers in the NAM population. Genome-wide association tests were performed with 26.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NAM population and with 246,497 SNPs in the association population, resulting in the identification of 18 and three loci associated with variation in flecking, respectively. Many of the candidate genes colocalizing with associated SNPs are similar to genes that function in plant defense response via cell wall modification, salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-dependent pathways, redox homeostasis, stress response, and vesicle trafficking/remodeling. Significant positive correlations were found between increased flecking, stronger defense response, increased disease resistance, and increased pest resistance. A nonlinear relationship with total kernel weight also was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed whereby lines with relatively high levels of flecking had, on average, lower total kernel weight. We present evidence suggesting that mild flecking could be used as a selection criterion for breeding programs trying to incorporate broad-spectrum disease resistance.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>e an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental population genetic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding mutations including common mutations outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. Mutations were first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of mutation and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid mutations confer resistance providing a large mutational target—we estimate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population mutation parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be estimated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> estimated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously underestimated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may underestimate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously estimated.</p>

Large Numbers of Novel miRNAs Originate from DNA Transposons and Are Coincident with a Large Species Radiation in Bats
<p>Vesper bats (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a rapid adaptive radiation beginning around 36 Ma that resulted in the second most species-rich mammalian family (>400 species). Coincident with that radiation was an initial burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present in some species. Such extensive and recent DNA transposon activity has not been seen in any other extant mammal. Indeed, retrotransposon activity is much more common in all other sequenced mammal genomes. Deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction from a vespertilionid bat, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, as well as a dog and horse revealed large numbers of 17–24 bp putative miRNAs (p/miRNAs). Although the origination rate of p/miRNAs is similar in all three taxa, 61.1% of postdivergence p/miRNAs in <i>Eptesicus</i> are derived from transposable elements (TEs) compared with only 23.9% and 16.5% in the dog and horse, respectively. Not surprisingly, given the retrotransposon bias of dog and horse, the majority of TE-derived p/miRNAs are associated with retrotransposons. In <i>Eptesicus</i>, however, 58.7% of the TE-derived and 35.9% of the total p/miRNAs arose not from retrotransposons but from bat-specific DNA transposons. Notably, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>e that the timing of the DNA transposon expansion and the resulting introduction of novel p/miRNAs coincide with the rapid diversification of the family Vespertilionidae. Furthermore, potential targets of the DNA transposon-derived p/miRNAs are identifiable and enriched for genes that are important for regulation of transcription. We propose that lineage-specific DNA transposon activity lead to the rapid and repeated introduction of novel p/miRNAs. Some of these p/miRNAs are likely functional miRNAs and potentially influenced the diversification of Vespertilionidae. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations suggest a mechanism for introducing functional genomic variation rapidly through the expansion of DNA transposons that fits within the TE-thrust hypothesis.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the mechanism of generating water motion by mouth suction.</p>

Approximately, 6.3% of expressed genes are alternatively spliced in <i>B. distachyon</i>. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed that a majority of the identified AS events were related to retained introns (55.5%), followed by alternative acceptor sites (16.7%). We also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed a low percentage of exon skipping (5.0%) and alternative donor site events (8.8%). The ‘complex event’ that consists of a combination of two or more basic splicing events accounted for ∼14.0%.

The present study postulates a large repertoire of a set of optimal codons for the <i>Citrus</i> genus and <i>P. trifoliata</i> and demonstrates that GCT and GGT are evolutionary conserved optimal codons. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ation suggested that mutational bias is the dominating force in shaping the codon usage bias (CUB) in <i>Citrus</i> and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. Correspondence analysis (COA) revealed that the principal axis [axis 1; COA/relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)] contributes only a minor portion (∼10.96%) of the recorded variance. In all analysed species, except <i>P. trifoliata</i>, Gravy and aromaticity played minor roles in resolving CUB. Compositional constraints were found to be strongly associated with the amino acid signatures in <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i>.

Dual role for Hox genes and Hox co-factors in conferring leg motoneuron survival and identity in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Adult <i>Drosophila</i> walk using six multi-jointed legs, each controlled by ∼50 leg motoneurons (MNs). Although MNs have stereotyped morphologies, little is known about how they are specified. Here, we describe the function of Hox genes and <i>homothorax</i> (<i>hth</i>), which encodes a Hox co-factor, in <i>Drosophila</i> leg MN development. Removing either Hox or Hth function from a single neuroblast (NB) lineage results in MN apoptosis. A single Hox gene, <i>Antennapedia</i> (<i>Antp</i>), is primarily responsible for MN survival in all three thoracic segments. When cell death is blocked, partially penetrant axon branching errors are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in Hox mutant MNs. When single MNs are mutant, errors in both dendritic and axon arborizations are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed. Our data also suggest that Antp levels in post-mitotic MNs are important for specifying their identities. Thus, in addition to being essential for survival, Hox and <i>hth</i> are required to specify accurate MN morphologies in a level-dependent manner.</p>

Progerin expression was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence. Cardiovascular alterations were determined by immunofluorescence and histology in male mice fed normal chow or a high-fat diet. In vivo low-density lipoprotein retention was assessed by intravenous injection of fluorescently labeled human low-density lipoprotein. Cardiac electric defects were evaluated by electrocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>G609G/G609G</i></sup> mice with ubiquitous progerin expression exhibited a premature aging phenotype that included failure to thrive and shortened survival. In addition, high-fat diet–fed <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>G609G/G609G</i></sup> mice developed a severe vascular pathology, including medial VSMC loss and lipid retention, adventitial fibrosis, and accelerated atherosclerosis, thus resembling most aspects of cardiovascular disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in patients with HGPS. The same vascular alterations were also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup><i>SM22αCre</i> mice expressing progerin specifically in VSMCs, but not in <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup><i>LysMCre</i> mice with macrophage-specific progerin expression. Moreover, <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup><i>SM22αCre</i> mice had a shortened lifespan despite the lack of any overt aging phenotype. Aortas of ubiquitously and VSMC-specific progerin-expressing mice exhibited increased retention of fluorescently labeled human low-density lipoprotein, and atheromata in both models showed vulnerable plaque features. Immunohistopathological examination indicated that <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup><i>SM22αCre</i> mice, unlike <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>G609G/G609G</i></sup> mice, die of atherosclerosis-related causes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have generated the first mouse model of progerin-induced atherosclerosis acceleration, and demonstrate that restricting progerin expression to VSMCs is sufficient to accelerate atherosclerosis, trigger plaque vulnerability, and reduce lifespan. Our results identify progerin-induced VSMC death as a major factor triggering atherosclerosis and premature death in HGPS.</p></sec>

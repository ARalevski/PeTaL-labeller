Multimessenger observations of a flaring blazar coincident with high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A
<p>Previous detections of individual astrophysical sources of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong>s are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong>s remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong>, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera–electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray–emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong>s.</p>

Neutrino emission from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056 prior to the IceCube-170922A alert
<p>A high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> observations to search for excess emission at the position of the blazar. We found an excess of high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5σ evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode. This suggests that blazars are identifiable sources of the high-energy astrophysical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> flux.</p>

Observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
<p>The coherent elastic scattering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong>s off nuclei has eluded detection for four decades, even though its predicted cross section is by far the largest of all low-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> couplings. This mode of interaction offers new opportunities to study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> properties and leads to a miniaturization of detector size, with potential technological applications. We observed this process at a 6.7σ confidence level, using a low-background, 14.6-kilogram CsI[Na] scintillator exposed to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> emissions from the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Characteristic signatures in energy and time, predicted by the standard model for this process, were observed in high signal-to-background conditions. Improved constraints on nonstandard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> interactions with quarks are derived from this initial data set.</p>

Extended gamma-ray sources around pulsars constrain the origin of the positron flux at Earth
<p>The unexpectedly high flux of cosmic-ray positrons detected at Earth may originate from nearby astrophysical sources, dark matter, or unknown processes of cosmic-ray secondary production. We report the detection, using the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), of extended tera–electron volt gamma-ray emission coincident with the locations of two nearby middle-aged pulsars (Geminga and PSR B0656+14). The HAWC observations demonstrate that these pulsars are indeed local sources of accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lepton</span></strong>s, but the measured tera–electron volt emission profile constrains the diffusion of particles away from these sources to be much slower than previously assumed. We demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lepton</span></strong>s emitted by these objects are therefore unlikely to be the origin of the excess positrons, which may have a more exotic origin.</p>

Chiral Majorana fermion modes in a quantum anomalous Hall insulator–superconductor structure
<p>Majorana fermion is a hypothetical particle that is its own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antiparticl</span></strong>e. We report transport measurements that suggest the existence of one-dimensional chiral Majorana fermion modes in the hybrid system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film coupled with a superconductor. As the external magnetic field is swept, half-integer quantized conductance plateaus are observed at the locations of magnetization reversals, giving a distinct signature of the Majorana fermion modes. This transport signature is reproducible over many magnetic field sweeps and appears at different temperatures. This finding may open up an avenue to control Majorana fermions for implementing robust topological quantum computing.</p>

Buffer-gas cooling of antiprotonic helium to 1.5 to 1.7 K, and antiproton-to–electron mass ratio
<p>Charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry implies that a particle and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antiparticl</span></strong>e have the same mass. The antiproton-to-electron mass ratio [Formula] can be precisely determined from the single-photon transition frequencies of antiprotonic helium. We measured 13 such frequencies with laser spectroscopy to a fractional precision of 2.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup> to 16 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. About 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> antiprotonic helium atoms were cooled to temperatures between 1.5 and 1.7 kelvin by using buffer-gas cooling in cryogenic low-pressure helium gas; the narrow thermal distribution led to the observation of sharp spectral lines of small thermal Doppler width. The deviation between the experimental frequencies and the results of three-body quantum electrodynamics calculations was reduced by a factor of 1.4 to 10 compared with previous single-photon experiments. From this, [Formula] was determined as 1836.1526734(15), which agrees with a recent proton-to-electron experimental value within 8 × 10<sup>−10</sup>.</p>

Interscapulothoracic resection of tumours of shoulder with a note on reconstruction
<p>We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 33   consecutive patients who had undergone an extra-articular, total or   partial scapulectomy for a malignant tumour of the shoulder girdle   between 1 July 2001 and 30 September 2013. Of these, 26 had tumours   which originated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scapula</span></strong> or the adjacent soft tissue and   underwent a classic Tikhoff–Linberg procedure, while seven with   tumours arising from the proximal humerus were treated with a modified   Tikhoff-Linberg operation. We used a Ligament Advanced Reinforcement   System for soft-tissue reconstruction in nine patients, but not   in the other 24.</p><p>The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score (MSTS) was 17.6   (95% confidence interval (CI) 15.9 to 19.4); 17.6 (95% CI 15.5 to   19.6) after the classic Tikhoff–Linberg procedure and 18.1 (95%   CI 13.8 to 22.3) after the modified Tikhoff–Linberg procedure. Patients   who had undergone a LARS soft-tissue reconstruction had a mean score   of 18.6 (95% (CI) 13.9 to 22.4) compared with 17.2 (95% CI 15.5   to 19.0) for those who did not.</p><p>The Tikhoff–Linberg procedure is a useful method for wide resection   of a malignant tumour of the shoulder girdle which helps to preserve   hand and elbow function. The method of soft-tissue reconstruction   has no effect on functional outcome. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:684–90.</p>

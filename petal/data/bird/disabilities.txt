Trans-inhibition of activation and proliferation signals by Fc receptors in mast cells and basophils
<p>Allergic and autoimmune inflammation are associated with the activation of mast cells and basophils by antibodies against allergens or auto-antigens, respectively. Both cell types express several receptors for the Fc portion of antibodies, the engagement of which by antigen-antibody complexes controls their responses. When aggregated on the plasma membrane, high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptors (FcεRI) and low-affinity IgG receptors (FcγRIIIA in mice, FcγRIIA in humans) induce these cells to release and secrete proinflammatory mediators, chemokines, and cytokines that account for clinical symptoms. When coaggregated with activating receptors on the same cells, other low-affinity IgG receptors (FcγRIIB in both species) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong> mast cell and basophil activation. We found that FcγRIIB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed not only signals triggered by activating receptors with which they were coengaged (cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion), but also signals triggered by receptors engaged independently (trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion). Trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion acted upon the FcεRI-dependent activation of mouse mast cells, mouse basophils, and human basophils, and upon growth factor receptor (Kit)–dependent normal mouse mast cell proliferation, as well as the constitutive in vitro proliferation and the in vivo growth of oncogene (v-Abl)–transformed mastocytoma cells. Trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion was induced by receptors, whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ory (FcγRIIB) or activating (FcεRI), which recruited the lipid phosphatase SHIP1. By hydrolyzing PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, SHIP1 induced a global unresponsiveness that affected biological responses triggered by receptors that use phosphoinositide 3-kinase to signal. These data suggest that trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion controls numerous physiological and pathological processes, and that it may be used as a therapeutic tool in inflammation, especially but not exclusively, in allergy and autoimmunity.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root growth and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of root growth response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion is regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion in response to Al stress.</p>

Interleukin-10 Inhibits Bone Marrow Fibroblast Progenitor Cell–Mediated Cardiac Fibrosis in Pressure-Overloaded Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) play a critical role in cardiac fibrosis; however, their origin in the diseased heart remains unclear, warranting further investigation. Recent studies suggest the contribution of bone marrow fibroblast progenitor cells (BM-FPCs) in pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis. We have previously shown that interleukin-10 (IL10) suppresses pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis; however, the role of IL10 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of BM-FPC–mediated cardiac fibrosis is not known.

Furthermore, WT bone marrow (from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice) transplantation in bone marrow–depleted IL10KO mice (IL10KO chimeric mice) reduced transverse aortic constriction–induced BM-FPC mobilization compared with IL10KO mice. Green fluorescent protein costaining with α-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1α in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric mice suggests that myofibroblasts were derived from bone marrow after transverse aortic constriction. Finally, WT bone marrow transplantation in IL10KO mice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac fibrosis and improved heart function. At the molecular level, IL10 treatment significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed transforming growth factor-β–induced transdifferentiation and fibrotic signaling in WT BM-FPCs in vitro. Furthermore, fibrosis-associated microRNA (miRNA) expression was highly upregulated in IL10KO-FPCs compared with WT-FPCs.

Disabling the Gβγ-SNARE interaction disrupts GPCR-mediated presynaptic inhibition, leading to physiological and behavioral phenotypes
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that couple to G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins modulate neurotransmission presynaptically by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing exocytosis. Release of Gβγ subunits from activated G proteins decreases the activity of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs), decreasing excitability. A less understood Gβγ-mediated mechanism downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is the binding of Gβγ to SNARE complexes, which facilitate the fusion of vesicles with the cell plasma membrane in exocytosis. Here, we generated mice expressing a form of the SNARE protein SNAP25 with premature truncation of the C terminus and that were therefore partially deficient in this interaction. SNAP25Δ3 homozygote mice exhibited normal presynaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion by GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong> VGCCs, but defective presynaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion by receptors that work directly on the SNARE complex, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 5-HT<sub>1b</sub> receptors and adrenergic α<sub>2a</sub> receptors. Simultaneously stimulating receptors that act through both mechanisms showed synergistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ory effects. SNAP25Δ3 homozygote mice had various behavioral phenotypes, including increased stress-induced hyperthermia, defective spatial learning, impaired gait, and supraspinal nociception. These data suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of exocytosis by G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled GPCRs through the Gβγ-SNARE interaction is a crucial component of numerous physiological and behavioral processes.</p>

The kinases HipA and HipA7 phosphorylate different substrate pools in <i>Escherichia coli</i> to promote multidrug tolerance
<p>The bacterial serine-threonine protein kinase HipA promotes multidrug tolerance by phosphorylating the glutamate-tRNA ligase (GltX), leading to a halt in translation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of growth, and induction of a physiologically dormant state (persistence). The HipA variant HipA7 substantially increases persistence despite being less efficient at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing cell growth. We postulated that this phenotypic difference was caused by differences in the substrates targeted by both kinases. We overproduced HipA and HipA7 in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and identified their endogenous substrates by SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomics. We confirmed that GltX was the main substrate of both kinase variants and likely the primary determinant of persistence. When HipA and HipA7 were moderately overproduced from plasmids, HipA7 targeted only GltX, but HipA phosphorylated several additional substrates involved in translation, transcription, and replication, such as ribosomal protein L11 (RplK) and the negative modulator of replication initiation, SeqA. HipA7 showed reduced kinase activity compared to HipA and targeted a substrate pool similar to that of HipA only when produced from a high–copy number plasmid. The kinase variants also differed in autophosphorylation, which was substantially reduced for HipA7. When produced endogenously from the chromosome, HipA showed no activity because of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion by the antitoxin HipB, whereas HipA7 phosphorylated GltX and phage shock protein PspA. Initial testing did not reveal a connection between HipA-induced phosphorylation of RplK and persistence or growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion, suggesting that other HipA-specific substrates were likely responsible for growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. Our results contribute to the understanding of HipA7 action and present a resource for elucidating HipA-related persistence.</p>

Targeting nucleotide exchange to inhibit constitutively active G protein α subunits in cancer cells
<p>Constitutively active G protein α subunits cause cancer, cholera, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and other disorders. Therapeutic intervention by targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of constitutively active Gα subunits in these disorders has yet to be achieved. We found that constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub> in uveal melanoma (UM) cells was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed by the cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR). FR allosterically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed guanosine diphosphate–for–guanosine triphosphate (GDP/GTP) exchange to trap constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub> in inactive, GDP-bound Gαβγ heterotrimers. Allosteric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of other Gα subunits was achieved by the introduction of an FR-binding site. In UM cells driven by constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub>, FR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed second messenger signaling, arrested cell proliferation, reinstated melanocytic differentiation, and stimulated apoptosis. In contrast, FR had no effect on <i>BRAF</i>-driven UM cells. FR promoted UM cell differentiation by reactivating polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)–mediated gene silencing, a heretofore unrecognized effector system of constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub> in UM. Constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub> and PRC2 therefore provide therapeutic targets for UM. The development of FR analogs specific for other Gα subunit subtypes may provide novel therapeutic approaches for diseases driven by constitutively active Gα subunits or multiple G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) where targeting a single receptor is ineffective.</p>

Identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of type 1 adenylyl cyclase activity with analgesic properties
<p>Adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) belongs to a group of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) that are stimulated by calcium in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Studies with AC1 knockout mice suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors of AC1 may be useful for treating pain and opioid dependence. However, nonselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of AC isoforms could result in substantial adverse effects. We used chemical library screening to identify a selective AC1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or with a chromone core structure that may represent a new analgesic agent.

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p>Auxin has been shown to enhance root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), auxin may play a negative role in the Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of root growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize auxin efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. Root growth in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to auxin, was less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root tips displayed higher auxin accumulation and enhanced auxin signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the auxin-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of auxin in the root tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more auxin in their root tips. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced auxin accumulation in root tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of root growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of auxin and auxin polar transport in Al-induced root growth regulation in maize.</p>

Biotin Attachment Domain-Containing Proteins Irreversibly Inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
<p>The first committed step in fatty acid synthesis is mediated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), a biotin-dependent enzyme that carboxylates acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-term or long-term exposure to fatty acids in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly containing oleic acid), which results in reversible or irreversible ACCase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin carboxyl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporation into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-containing) biotin carboxyltransferase protein subunits. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines containing T-DNA insertions in <i>BADC1</i>, <i>BADC2</i>, and <i>BADC3</i> were used to generate <i>badc1 badc2</i> and <i>badc1 badc3</i> double mutants. The <i>badc1 badc3</i> mutant exhibited normal growth and development; however, ACCase activity was 26% higher in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and its seeds contained 30.1% more fatty acids and 32.6% more triacylgycerol relative to wild-type plants. To assess whether BADC contributes to the irreversible phase of ACCase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion, cell suspension cultures were generated from the leaves of <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type plants and treated with 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tween 80. Reversible ACCase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion was similar in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type cultures after 2 d of Tween 80 treatment, but irreversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion was reduced by 50% in <i>badc1 badc3</i> relative to wild-type plants following 4 d of Tween 80 treatment. In this study, we present evidence for two important homeostatic roles for BADC proteins in down-regulating ACCase activity: by acting during normal growth and development and by contributing to its long-term irreversible feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion resulting from the oversupply of fatty acids.</p>

Development of the GABA-ergic signaling system and its role in larval swimming in sea urchin

The regulation of larval swimming was increasingly dependent on the GABAergic system, which was active from the 2 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.) pluteus stage onwards. GABA-immunoreactive cells were detected as a subpopulation of secondary mesenchyme cells during gastrulation and eventually constituted the ciliary band and a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells during the pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gad</i> transcription was detected by RT-PCR during the period when Hp-Gad-positive cells were seen as a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells and on the apical side of the ciliary band from the 2 d.p.f. pluteus stage.

Dual enhancement of T and NK cell function by pulsatile inhibition of SHIP1 improves antitumor immunity and survival
<p>The success of immunotherapy in some cancer patients has revealed the profound capacity for cytotoxic lymphocytes to eradicate malignancies. Various immunotherapies work by blocking key checkpoint proteins that suppress immune cell activity. The phosphatase SHIP1 (SH2-containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase) limits signaling from receptors that activate natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. However, unexpectedly, genetic ablation studies have shown that the effector functions of SHIP1-deficient NK and T cells are compromised in vivo. Because chronic activation of immune cells renders them less responsive to activating signals (a host mechanism to avoid autoimmunity), we hypothesized that the failure of SHIP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion to induce antitumor immunity in those studies was caused by the permanence of genetic ablation. Accordingly, we found that reversible and pulsatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of SHIP1 with 3-α-aminocholestane (3AC; “SHIPi”) increased the antitumor response of NK and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro and in vivo. Transient SHIP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion in mouse models of lymphoma and colon cancer improved the median and long-term tumor-free survival rates. Adoptive transfer assays showed evidence of immunological memory to the tumor in hematolymphoid cells from SHIPi-treated, long-term surviving mice. The findings suggest that a pulsatile regimen of SHIP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion might be an effective immunotherapy in some cancer patients.</p>

Blockade of surface-bound TGF-β on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress antitumor immunity by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing the killing of tumor cells by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel cultures of dissociated B16 melanoma tumors. This system recapitulated the in vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the dissociated tumor cells resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T cells. Immunosuppression was not observed when tumors excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) also prevented immunosuppression. Immunosuppression depended on cell-cell contact or cellular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong> tumor cell killing by T cells. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that tumor-specific Pmel-1 effector T cells physically interacted with tumor-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice.

Immunosuppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic protein granzyme B and an increase in the cell surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1).

A Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitor Enhances Resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> Wilt
<p>Pectins are major components of the primary plant cell wall, which functions as the primary barrier against pathogens. Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) catalyze the demethylesterification of the homogalacturonan domains of pectin in the plant cell wall. Their activity is regulated by PME <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors (PMEIs). Here, we provide evidence that the pectin methylesterase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing protein GhPMEI3 from cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) functions in plant responses to infection by the fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>. GhPMEI3 interacts with PMEs and regulates the expression of a specific fungal polygalacturonase (VdPG1). Ectopic expression of GhPMEI3 increased pectin methyl esterification and limited fungal disease in cotton, while also modulating root elongation. Enzymatic analyses revealed that GhPMEI3 efficiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed the activity of cotton GhPME2/GhPME31. Experiments using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants expressing the <i>GhPMEI3</i> gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter revealed that GhPMEI3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s the endogenous PME activity in vitro. Moreover, the enhanced resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> was associated with altered <i>VdPG1</i> expression. Virus-induced silencing of <i>GhPMEI3</i> resulted in increased susceptibility to <i>V. dahliae</i>. Further, we investigated the interaction between GhPMEI3 and GhPME2/GhPME31 using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion assays and molecular docking simulations. The peculiar structural features of GhPMEI3 were responsible for the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with GhPME2/GhPME31. Together, these results suggest that GhPMEI3 enhances resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt. Moreover, GhPMEI3-GhPMEs interactions would be needed before drawing the correlation between structure-function and are crucial for plant development against the ever-evolving fungal pathogens.</p>

The Prenylated Rab GTPase Receptor PRA1.F4 Contributes to Protein Exit from the Golgi Apparatus
<p>Prenylated Rab acceptor1 (PRA1) functions in the recruitment of prenylated Rab proteins to their cognate organelles. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains a large number of proteins belonging to the AtPRA1 family. However, their physiological roles remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the physiological role of AtPRA1.F4, a member of the AtPRA1 family. A T-DNA insertion knockdown mutant of <i>AtPRA1.F4</i>, <i>atpra1.f4</i>, was smaller in stature than parent plants and possessed shorter roots, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing HA:AtPRA1.F4 showed enhanced development of secondary roots and root hairs. However, both overexpression and knockdown plants exhibited increased sensitivity to high-salt stress, lower vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and plasma membrane ATPase activities, lower and higher pH in the vacuole and apoplast, respectively, and highly vesiculated Golgi apparatus. HA:AtPRA1.F4 localized to the Golgi apparatus and assembled into high-molecular-weight complexes. <i>atpra1.f4</i> plants displayed a defect in vacuolar trafficking, which was complemented by low but not high levels of <i>HA</i>:<i>AtPRA1.F4</i>. Overexpression of HA:AtPRA1.F4 also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed protein trafficking at the Golgi apparatus, albeit differentially depending on the final destination or type of protein: trafficking of vacuolar proteins, plasma membrane proteins, and trans-Golgi network (TGN)-localized SYP61 was strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed; trafficking of TGN-localized SYP51 was slightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed; and trafficking of secretory proteins and TGN-localized SYP41 was negligibly or not significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed. Based on these results, we propose that Golgi-localized AtPRA1.F4 is involved in the exit of many but not all types of post-Golgi proteins from the Golgi apparatus. Additionally, an appropriate level of AtPRA1.F4 is crucial for its function at the Golgi apparatus.</p>

Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Induces Aortic Valve Calcification by Inhibiting Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Signaling in Valvular Interstitial Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Calcification of the aortic valve leads to increased leaflet stiffness and consequently to the development of calcific aortic valve disease. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of calcification remain unclear. Here, we identified that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4, also known as CD26) increases valvular calcification and promotes calcific aortic valve disease progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We obtained the aortic valve tissues from humans and murine models (wild-type and endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient-mice) and cultured the valvular interstitial cells (VICs) and valvular endothelial cells from the cusps.

We also induced calcific aortic stenosis in male New Zealand rabbits (weight, 2.5–3.0 kg) by a cholesterol-enriched diet+vitamin D2 (25 000 IU, daily). Echocardiography was performed to assess the aortic valve area and the maximal and mean transaortic pressure gradients at baseline and 3-week intervals thereafter. After 12 weeks, we harvested the heart and evaluated the aortic valve tissue using immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that nitric oxide depletion in human valvular endothelial cells activates NF-κB in human VICs. Consequently, the NF-κB promotes DPP-4 expression, which then induces the osteogenic differentiation of VICs by limiting autocrine insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of DPP-4 enzymatic activity blocked the osteogenic changes in VICs in vitro and reduced the aortic valve calcification in vivo in a mouse model.

Non-specificity of Pitstop 2 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis
<p>Small molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis are highly desired for the dissection of membrane trafficking pathways in the lab and for potential use as anti-infectives in the clinic. One <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion strategy is to prevent clathrin from contacting adaptor proteins so that clathrin-mediated endocytosis cannot occur. “Pitstop” compounds have been developed that block only one of the four functional interaction sites on the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. Despite this limitation, Pitstop 2 causes profound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study, we probed for non-specific activity of Pitstop 2 by examining its action in cells expressing clathrin heavy chain harbouring mutations in the N-terminal domain interaction sites. We conclude that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion observed with this compound is due to non-specificity, i.e. it causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion away from its proposed mode of action. We recommend that these compounds be used with caution in cells and that they should not be used to conclude anything of the function of clathrin's N-terminal domain.</p>

Oligomerization of MrgC11 and μ-opioid receptors in sensory neurons enhances morphine analgesia
<p>The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist morphine is commonly used for pain management, but it has severe adverse effects and produces analgesic tolerance. Thus, alternative ways of stimulating MOR activity are needed. We found that MrgC11, a sensory neuron–specific G protein–coupled receptor, may form heteromeric complexes with MOR. Peptide-mediated activation of MrgC11 enhanced MOR recycling by inducing coendocytosis and sorting of MOR for membrane reinsertion. MrgC11 activation also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed the coupling of MOR to β-arrestin-2 and enhanced the morphine-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of cAMP production. Intrathecal coadministration of a low dose of an MrgC agonist potentiated acute morphine analgesia and reduced chronic morphine tolerance in wild-type mice but not in <i>Mrg</i>-cluster knockout (Mrg KO) mice. BAM22, a bivalent agonist of MrgC and opioid receptors, enhanced the interaction between MrgC11 and MOR and produced stronger analgesia than did the individual monovalent agonists. Morphine-induced neuronal and pain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion was reduced in Mrg KO mice compared to that in wild-type mice. Our results uncover MrgC11-MOR interactions that lead to positive functional modulation of MOR. MrgC shares genetic homogeneity and functional similarity with human MrgX1. Thus, harnessing this positive modulation of MOR function by Mrg signaling may enhance morphine analgesia in a sensory neuron–specific fashion to limit central side effects.</p>

Inhibition of somatosensory mechanotransduction by annexin A6

The conotoxin NMB-1 (noxious mechanosensation blocker-1) blocks such currents and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s mechanical pain. Using a biotinylated form of NMB-1 in mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 67 binding proteins in sensory neurons and a sensory neuron–derived cell line, of which the top candidate was annexin A6, a membrane-associated calcium-binding protein. Annexin A6–deficient mice showed increased sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. Sensory neurons from these mice showed increased activity of the cation channel Piezo2, which mediates a rapidly adapting mechano-gated current linked to proprioception and touch, and a decrease in mechanically activated, slowly adapting currents. Conversely, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory neurons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed rapidly adapting currents that were partially mediated by Piezo2.

The nuclear translocation of the kinases p38 and JNK promotes inflammation-induced cancer
<p>The stimulated nuclear translocation of signaling proteins, such as MAPKs, is a necessity for the initiation and regulation of their physiological functions. Previously, we determined that nuclear translocation of the MAPKs p38 and JNK involves binding to heterodimers comprising importin 3 and either importin 7 or importin 9. Here, we identified the importin-binding region in p38 and JNK and developed a myristoylated peptide targeting this site that we called PERY. The PERY peptide specifically blocked the interaction of p38 and JNK with the importins, restricted their nuclear translocation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed phosphorylation of their nuclear (but not cytoplasmic) substrates. Through these effects, the PERY peptide reduced the proliferation of several (but not all) cancer cell lines in culture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed the growth of a human breast cancer xenograft in mice. In addition, the PERY peptide substantially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed inflammation in mice, as manifested in models of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer. The PERY peptide more effectively prevented colon cancer development than did a commercial p38 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or. In vivo analysis further suggested that this effect was mediated by PERY peptide–induced prevention of the nuclear translocation of p38 in macrophages. Together, these results support the use of the nuclear translocation of p38 and JNK as a novel drug target to treat various cancers and inflammation-induced diseases.</p>

The nociceptin receptor inhibits axonal regeneration and recovery from spinal cord injury
<p>Axonal growth after traumatic spinal cord injury is limited by endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors, selective blockade of which promotes partial neurological recovery. The partial repair phenotypes suggest that compensatory pathways limit improvement. Gene expression profiles of mice deficient in <i>Ngr1</i>, which encodes a receptor for myelin-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors of axonal regeneration such as Nogo, revealed that trauma increased the mRNA expression of <i>ORL1</i>, which encodes the receptor for the opioid-related peptide nociceptin. Endogenous and overexpressed ORL1 coimmunoprecipitated with immature NgR1 protein, and ORL1 enhanced the O-linked glycosylation and surface expression of NgR1 in HEK293T and Neuro2A cells and primary neurons. ORL1 overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed cortical neuron axon regeneration independently of NgR1. Furthermore, regeneration was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed by an ORL1 agonist and enhanced by the ORL1 antagonist J113397 through a ROCK-dependent mechanism.

These effects were further enhanced by combined <i>Ngr1</i> deletion and ORL1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion.

The endoplasmic reticulum–residing chaperone BiP is short-lived and metabolized through N-terminal arginylation
<p>BiP and other endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–resident proteins are thought to be metabolically stable and to function primarily in the ER lumen. We sought to assess how the abundance of these proteins dynamically fluctuates in response to various stresses and how their subpopulations are relocated to non-ER compartments such as the cytosol. We showed that the molecular chaperone BiP (also known as GRP78) was short-lived under basal conditions and ER stress. The turnover of BiP was in part driven by its amino-terminal arginylation (Nt-arginylation) by the arginyltransferase ATE1, which generated an autophagic N-degron of the N-end rule pathway. ER stress elicited the formation of R-BiP, an effect that was increased when the proteasome was also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed. Nt-arginylation correlated with the cytosolic relocalization of BiP under the types of stress tested. The cytosolic relocalization of BiP did not require the functionality of the unfolded protein response or the Sec61- or Derlin1-containing translocon. A key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or of the turnover and Nt-arginylation of BiP was HERP (homocysteine-responsive ER protein), a 43-kDa ER membrane–integrated protein that is an essential component of ER-associated protein degradation. Pharmacological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of the ER-Golgi secretory pathway also suppressed R-BiP formation. Finally, we showed that cytosolic R-BiP induced by ER stress and proteasomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion was routed to autophagic vacuoles and possibly additional metabolic fates. These results suggest that Nt-arginylation is a posttranslational modification that modulates the function, localization, and metabolic fate of ER-resident proteins.</p>

Aberrant Rac1-cofilin signaling mediates defects in dendritic spines, synaptic function, and sensory perception in fragile X syndrome
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disabilities and a leading cause of autism. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the gene <i>FMR1</i> on the X chromosome. The neuroanatomical hallmark of FXS is an overabundance of immature dendritic spines, a factor thought to underlie synaptic dysfunction and impaired cognition. We showed that aberrantly increased activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin, a major determinant of dendritic spine structure, and caused disease-associated spine abnormalities in the somatosensory cortex of FXS model mice. Increased cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization coincided with abnormal dendritic spines and impaired synaptic maturation. Viral delivery of a constitutively active cofilin mutant (cofilinS3A) into the somatosensory cortex of <i>Fmr1</i>-deficient mice rescued the immature dendritic spine phenotype and increased spine density. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of the Rac1 effector PAK1 with a small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or rescued cofilin signaling in FXS mice, indicating a causal relationship between PAK1 and cofilin signaling. PAK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion rescued synaptic signaling (specifically the synaptic ratio of NMDA/AMPA in layer V pyramidal neurons) and improved sensory processing in FXS mice. These findings suggest a causal relationship between increased Rac1-cofilin signaling, synaptic defects, and impaired sensory processing in FXS and uncover a previously unappreciated role for impaired Rac1-cofilin signaling in the aberrant spine morphology and spine density associated with FXS.</p>

TGF-β receptor I/II trafficking and signaling at primary cilia are inhibited by ceramide to attenuate cell migration and tumor metastasis
<p>Signaling by the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) receptors I and II (TβRI/II) and the primary cilia-localized sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway promote cell migration and, consequently, tumor metastasis. In contrast, the sphingolipid ceramide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s cell proliferation and tumor metastasis. We investigated whether ceramide metabolism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed TβRI/II trafficking to primary cilia to attenuate cross-talk between TβRI/II and the Shh pathway. We found that ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4)–generated ceramide stabilized the association between TβRI and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ory factor Smad7, which limited the trafficking of TβRI/II to primary cilia. Expression of a mutant TβRI that signals but does not interact with Smad7 prevented the CerS4-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of migration in various cancer cells. Genetic deletion or knockdown of CerS4 prevented the formation of the Smad7-TβRI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ory complex and increased the association between TβRI and the transporter Arl6 through a previously unknown cilia-targeting signal (Ala<sup>31</sup>Thr<sup>32</sup>Ala<sup>33</sup>Leu<sup>34</sup>Gln<sup>35</sup>) in TβRI. Mutating the cilia-targeting signal abolished the trafficking of TβRI to the primary cilia. Localization of TβRI to primary cilia activated a key mediator of Shh signaling, Smoothened (Smo), which stimulated cellular migration and invasion. TβRI-Smo cross-talk at the cilia in CerS4-deficient 4T1 mammary cancer cells induced liver metastasis from orthotopic allografts in both wild-type and CerS4-deficient mice, which was prevented by overexpression of Smad7 or knockdown of intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88). Overall, these data reveal a ceramide-dependent mechanism that suppresses cell migration and invasion by restricting TβRI/II-Shh signaling selectively at the plasma membrane of the primary cilium.</p>

Bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino acids suppress sinonasal innate immunity through sweet taste receptors in solitary chemosensory cells
<p>In the upper respiratory epithelium, bitter and sweet taste receptors present in solitary chemosensory cells influence antimicrobial innate immune defense responses.

This mechanism is thought to control the magnitude of antimicrobial peptide release based on the sugar content of airway surface liquid. We hypothesized that <sc>d</sc>-amino acids, which are produced by various bacteria and activate T1R in taste receptor cells in the mouth, may also activate T1R in the airway. We showed that both the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits of the sweet taste receptor (T1R2/3) were present in the same chemosensory cells of primary human sinonasal epithelial cultures. Respiratory isolates of <i>Staphylococcus</i> species, but not <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, produced at least two <sc>d</sc>-amino acids that activate the sweet taste receptor.

AMPK promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and function by phosphorylating the epigenetic factors DNMT1, RBBP7, and HAT1
<p>Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis by directly phosphorylating metabolic enzymes and nutrient transporters and by indirectly promoting the transactivation of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. We explored the mechanism of AMPK-mediated induction of gene expression. We identified AMPK consensus phosphorylation sequences in three proteins involved in nucleosome remodeling: DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), retinoblastoma binding protein 7 (RBBP7), and histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1). DNMT1 mediates DNA methylation that limits transcription factor access to promoters and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed by RBBP7. Acetylation of histones by HAT1 creates a more relaxed chromatin-DNA structure that favors transcription. AMPK-mediated phosphorylation resulted in the activation of HAT1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of DNMT1. For DNMT1, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion was both a direct effect of phosphorylation and the result of increased interaction with RBBP7. In human umbilical vein cells, pharmacological AMPK activation or pulsatile shear stress triggered nucleosome remodeling and decreased cytosine methylation, leading to increased expression of nuclear genes encoding factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function, such as peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma coactivator–1α (PGC-1α), transcription factor A (Tfam), and uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 (UCP2 and UCP3). Similar effects were seen in the aortas of mice given pharmacological AMPK activators, and these effects required AMPK2α. These results enhance our understanding of AMPK-mediated mitochondrial gene expression through nucleosome remodeling.</p>

Tudor-SN–mediated endonucleolytic decay of human cell microRNAs promotes G<sub>1</sub>/S phase transition
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. The pathways that mediate mature miRNA decay are less well understood than those that mediate miRNA biogenesis. We found that functional miRNAs are degraded in human cells by the endonuclease Tudor-SN (TSN). In vitro, recombinant TSN initiated the decay of both protein-free and Argonaute 2–loaded miRNAs via endonucleolytic cleavage at CA and UA dinucleotides, preferentially at scissile bonds located more than five nucleotides away from miRNA ends.

Genetic Dissection of Fe-Dependent Signaling in Root Developmental Responses to Phosphate Deficiency
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of primary root (PR) growth is a major developmental response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Previous studies have independently uncovered key roles of the LOW PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (LPR1) ferroxidase, the tonoplast-localized ALUMINUM SENSITIVE3 (ALS3)/SENSITIVE TO ALUMINUM RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STAR1) transporter complex, and the SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1; a transcription factor)-ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (ALMT1; a malate transporter) regulatory module in mediating this response by controlling iron (Fe) homeostasis in roots, but how these three components interact to regulate PR growth under Pi deficiency remains unknown. Here, we dissected genetic relationships among these three key components and found that (1) STOP1, ALMT1, and LPR1 act downstream of ALS3/STAR1 in controlling PR growth under Pi deficiency; (2) ALS3/STAR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway by repressing STOP1 protein accumulation in the nucleus; and (3) STOP1-ALMT1 and LPR1 control PR growth under Pi deficiency in an interdependent manner involving the promotion of malate-dependent Fe accumulation in roots. Furthermore, this malate-mediated Fe accumulation depends on external Pi availability. We also performed a detailed analysis of the dynamic changes in the tissue-specific Fe accumulation patterns in the root tips of plants exposed to Pi deficiency. The results indicate that the degree of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of PR growth induced by Pi deficiency is not linked to the level of Fe accumulated in the root apical meristem or the elongation zone. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism that regulates the root developmental response to Pi deficiency.</p>

VAMP711 Is Required for Abscisic Acid-Mediated Inhibition of Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity
<p>Drought stress is a limiting environmental factor that affects plant growth and development. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in plant drought responses. Previous studies have indicated that ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) activity, and the decrease in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity promotes stomatal closure under drought stress, thereby reducing water loss. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we found that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), ABA induces an <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein, namely, VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 711 (VAMP711), to interact with the Arabidopsis PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases AHA1 and AHA2. The interaction occurs at their C-termini and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. Deletion of <i>VAMP711</i> in Arabidopsis results in a higher PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and slower stomatal closure in response to ABA and drought treatments. In addition, overexpression of <i>VAMP711</i> partially rescues the drought-sensitive phenotype of <i>ost2-2D</i>, a mutation in <i>AHA1</i> resulting in a constitutive activated PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Our results demonstrate that VAMP711 is involved in regulating ABA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and stomatal closure in response to drought stress.</p>

Hydrogen Sulfide Disturbs Actin Polymerization via <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration Resulting in Stunted Root Hair Growth
<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important signaling molecule in plants. Our previous report suggested that H<sub>2</sub>S signaling affects the actin cytoskeleton and root hair growth. However, the underlying mechanisms of its effects are not understood. <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration of proteins is regulated directly by H<sub>2</sub>S, which converts the thiol groups of cysteine (Cys) residues to persulfides and alters protein function. In this work, we studied the effects of <i>S</i>-sulfhydration on actin dynamics in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We generated transgenic plants overexpressing the H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis-related genes <i><sc>l</sc>-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE</i> (<i>LCD</i>) and <i><sc>d</sc>-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE</i> in the <i>O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase isoform a1</i> (<i>oasa1</i>) mutant and Columbia-0 backgrounds. The H<sub>2</sub>S content increased significantly in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. The density of filamentous actin (F-actin) bundles and the F-actin/globular actin ratio decreased in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration also was enhanced in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. An analysis of actin dynamics suggested that <i>S</i>-sulfhydration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed actin polymerization. We also found that ACTIN2 (ACT2) was <i>S</i>-sulfhydrated at Cys-287. Cys-287 is adjacent to the D-loop, which acts as a central region for hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and stabilizes F-actin filaments. Overaccumulation of H<sub>2</sub>S caused the depolymerization of F-actin bundles and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed root hair growth. Introduction of <i>ACT2</i> carrying a Cys-287-to-Ser mutation into an <i>act2-1</i> mutant partially suppressed H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of root hair growth.

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Oxidation of Translation Factor EF-Tu Inhibits the Repair of Photosystem II<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The repair of photosystem II (PSII) is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of repair is associated with oxidative damage to the translational elongation system in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion are unknown. We previously demonstrated in vitro that EF-Tu, a translation factor that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, is inactivated by reactive oxygen species via oxidation of the Cys residue Cys-82. In this study, we examined the physiological role of the oxidation of EF-Tu in <i>Synechocystis</i>. Under strong light, EF-Tu was rapidly oxidized to yield oxidized monomers in vivo. We generated a <i>Synechocystis</i> transformant that expressed mutated EF-Tu in which Cys-82 had been replaced with a Ser residue. Under strong light, the de novo synthesis of proteins that are required for PSII repair, such as D1, was enhanced in the transformant and photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of PSII was alleviated. However, photodamage to PSII, measured in the presence of lincomycin, was similar between the transformant and wild-type cells, suggesting that expression of mutated EF-Tu might enhance the repair of PSII. Alleviating photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion through mutation of EF-Tu did not alter cell growth under strong light, perhaps due to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. These observations suggest that the oxidation of EF-Tu under strong light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s PSII repair, resulting in the stimulation of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

UV-B Inhibits Leaf Growth through Changes in Growth Regulating Factors and Gibberellin Levels
<p>Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation affects leaf growth in a wide range of species. In this work, we demonstrate that UV-B levels present in solar radiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong> maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf growth without causing any other visible stress symptoms, including the accumulation of DNA damage. We conducted kinematic analyses of cell division and expansion to understand the impact of UV-B radiation on these cellular processes. Our results demonstrate that the decrease in leaf growth in UV-B-irradiated leaves is a consequence of a reduction in cell production and a shortened growth zone (GZ). To determine the molecular pathways involved in UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of leaf growth, we performed RNA sequencing on isolated GZ tissues of control and UV-B-exposed plants. Our results show a link between the observed leaf growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion and the expression of specific cell cycle and developmental genes, including growth-regulating factors (GRFs) and transcripts for proteins participating in different hormone pathways. Interestingly, the decrease in the GZ size correlates with a decrease in the concentration of GA19, the immediate precursor of the active gibberellin, GA1, by UV-B in this zone, which is regulated, at least in part, by the expression of GRF1 and possibly other transcription factors of the GRF family.</p>

ABA Suppresses Root Hair Growth via the OBP4 Transcriptional Regulator
<p>Plants modify organ growth and tune morphogenesis in response to various endogenous and environmental cues. At the cellular level, organ growth is often adjusted by alterations in cell growth, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this control remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify the DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (DOF)-type transcription regulator OBF BINDING PROTEIN4 (OBP4) as a repressor of cell growth. Ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s cell growth, resulting in severe dwarfism and the repression of genes involved in the regulation of water transport, root hair development, and stress responses. Among the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors known to control root hair growth, OBP4 binds the <i>ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE6-LIKE2</i> (<i>RSL2</i>) promoter to repress its expression. The accumulation of OBP4 proteins is detected in expanding root epidermal cells, and its expression level is increased by the application of abscisic acid (ABA) at concentrations sufficient to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong> root hair growth. ABA-dependent induction of <i>OBP4</i> is associated with the reduced expression of <i>RSL2</i>. Furthermore, ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> or loss of <i>RSL2</i> function results in ABA-insensitive root hair growth. Taken together, our results suggest that OBP4-mediated transcriptional repression of <i>RSL2</i> contributes to the ABA-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of root hair growth in Arabidopsis.</p>

Nitric Oxide Modulates Histone Acetylation at Stress Genes by Inhibition of Histone Deacetylases
<p>Histone acetylation, which is an important mechanism to regulate gene expression, is controlled by the opposing action of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In animals, several HDACs are subjected to regulation by nitric oxide (NO); in plants, however, it is unknown whether NO affects histone acetylation. We found that treatment with the physiological NO donor <i>S</i>-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) increased the abundance of several histone acetylation marks in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), which was strongly diminished in the presence of the NO scavenger 2-4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide. This increase was likely triggered by NO-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of HDAC activity, since GSNO and <i>S</i>-nitroso-<i>N</i>-acetyl-<sc>dl</sc>-penicillamine significantly and reversibly reduced total HDAC activity in vitro (in nuclear extracts) and in vivo (in protoplasts). Next, genome-wide H3K9/14ac profiles in Arabidopsis seedlings were generated by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and changes induced by GSNO, GSNO/2-4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide or trichostatin A (an HDAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or) were quantified, thereby identifying genes that display putative NO-regulated histone acetylation. Functional classification of these genes revealed that many of them are involved in the plant defense response and the abiotic stress response. Furthermore, salicylic acid, which is the major plant defense hormone against biotrophic pathogens, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed HDAC activity and increased histone acetylation by inducing endogenous NO production. These data suggest that NO affects histone acetylation by targeting and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing HDAC complexes, resulting in the hyperacetylation of specific genes. This mechanism might operate in the plant stress response by facilitating the stress-induced transcription of genes.</p>

cis-Cinnamic Acid Is a Novel, Natural Auxin Efflux Inhibitor That Promotes Lateral Root Formation
<p>Auxin steers numerous physiological processes in plants, making the tight control of its endogenous levels and spatiotemporal distribution a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms, including auxin biosynthesis, metabolic conversions, degradation, and transport. Here, we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (<i>c</i>-CA) as a novel and unique addition to a small group of endogenous molecules affecting in planta auxin concentrations. <i>c-CA</i> is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (<i>t</i>-CA). When grown on <i>c</i>-CA-containing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of plant species were shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high auxin levels, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of primary root growth, induction of root hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral rooting. By molecular docking and receptor binding assays, we showed that <i>c</i>-CA itself is neither an auxin nor an anti-auxin, and auxin profiling data revealed that <i>c</i>-CA does not significantly interfere with auxin biosynthesis. Single cell-based auxin accumulation assays showed that <i>c</i>-CA, and not <i>t</i>-CA, is a potent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or of auxin efflux. Auxin signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal distribution of the auxin response along the root of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants, and long-distance auxin transport assays showed no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of rootward auxin transport. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants are the consequence of a local change in auxin accumulation, induced by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of auxin efflux. This work reveals a novel mechanism how plants may regulate auxin levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of auxin homeostasis.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

An acquired distaste: sugar discrimination by the larval parasitoid <i>Microplitis croceipes</i> (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is affected by prior sugar exposure
<p>We examined gustatory responses of the larval parasitoid <i>Microplitis croceipes</i> to determine whether the adults discriminate among common sugars, including fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose, found in plants. When given single sugar solutions of sucrose, glucose, fructose and maltose at concentrations of 0.008–2.0 mol l<sup>−1</sup>, the estimated concentrations at which 50% of wasps initiated feeding ranged between 0.054 and 0.085 mol l<sup>−1</sup> for sucrose, glucose and fructose, which was significantly lower than for maltose. Wasps showed a strong decrease in feeding time for maltose or fructose following a brief exposure to other sugars, suggesting that wasps can distinguish maltose and fructose from the other sugars tested. The higher acceptance threshold and short feeding time in the case of maltose appears adaptive in light of the relatively poor nutritional quality of the sugar in the longevity trial. The pronounced feeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion seen for fructose following exposure to other sugars is not linked with lower nutritional performance. This feeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion was even seen in wasps that had fed on glucose at the lowest acceptance threshold (0.031 mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and persisted for 24 h.

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate concentration. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate concentrations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate concentration might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate concentrations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed, suggesting that SDH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate concentrations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.</p>

The fraction of strongly bound cross-bridges is increased in mice that carry the myopathy-linked myosin heavy chain mutation MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>
<p>Myosinopathies have emerged as a new group of diseases and are caused by mutations in genes encoding myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. One major hallmark of these diseases is skeletal muscle weakness or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paralysi</span></strong>s, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of muscle fibers from <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i> mice, which carry a mutation that provokes an L342Q change within the catalytic domain of the type IIb skeletal muscle myosin protein MYH4. Because homozygous animals develop rapid muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paralysi</span></strong>s, they must be killed by postnatal day 13, so all experiments were performed using skeletal muscles from adult heterozygous animals (<i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+). <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice contain MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup> expressed at 7% of the levels of the wild-type (WT) protein, and are overtly and histologically normal. However, mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized fibers revealed, upon maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, higher stiffness as well as altered meridional and equatorial reflections in <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice when compared with age-matched WT animals. Under rigor conditions, by contrast, no difference was observed between <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ and WT mice. Altogether, these findings prove that, in adult <i>MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup></i> heterozygous mice, the transition from weak to strong myosin cross-bridge binding is facilitated, increasing the number of strongly attached myosin heads, thus enhancing force production. These changes are predictably exacerbated in the type IIb fibers of homozygous mice, in which the embryonic myosin isoform is fully replaced by MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>, leading to a hypercontraction, muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paralysi</span></strong>s. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of skeletal myosinopathies.</p>

Olfactomedin-1 activity identifies a cell invasion checkpoint during epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the chick embryonic heart
<p>Endothelia in the atrioventricular (AV) canal of the developing heart undergo a prototypical epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) to begin heart valve formation. Using an <i>in vitro</i> invasion assay, an extracellular matrix protein, Olfactomedin-1 (OLFM1), was found to increase mesenchymal cell numbers in AV canals from embryonic chick hearts. Treatment with both anti-OLFM1 antibody and siRNA targeting OLFM1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s mesenchymal cell formation. OLFM1 does not alter cell proliferation, migration or apoptosis. Dispersion, but lack of invasion in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing antibody, identifies a specific role for OLFM1 in cell invasion during EMT. This role is conserved in other epithelia, as OLFM1 similarly enhances invasion by MDCK epithelial cells in a transwell assay. Synergy is observed when TGFβ2 and OLFM1 are added to MDCK cell cultures, indicating that OLFM-1 activity is cooperative with TGFβ. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of both OLFM1 and TGFβ in heart invasion assays shows a similar cooperative role during development. To explore OLFM1 activity during EMT, representative EMT markers were examined. Effects of OLFM1 protein and anti-OLFM1 on transcripts of cell-cell adhesion molecules and the transcription factors <i>Snail-1, Snail-2, Twist1</i> and <i>Sox-9</i> argue that OLFM1 does not initiate EMT. Rather, regulation of transcripts of <i>Zeb1</i> and <i>Zeb2</i>, secreted proteases and mesenchymal cell markers by both OLFM1 and anti-OLFM1 is consistent with regulation of the cell invasion step of EMT. We conclude that OLFM1 is present and necessary during EMT in the embryonic chick heart. Its role in cell invasion and mesenchymal cell gene regulation suggests an invasion checkpoint in EMT where OLFM1 acts to promote cell invasion into the three-dimensional matrix.</p>

Ligand-dependent Notch signaling strength orchestrates lateral induction and lateral inhibition in the developing inner ear
<p>During inner ear development, Notch exhibits two modes of operation: lateral induction, which is associated with prosensory specification, and lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion, which is involved in hair cell determination. These mechanisms depend respectively on two different ligands, jagged 1 (Jag1) and delta 1 (Dl1), that rely on a common signaling cascade initiated after Notch activation. In the chicken otocyst, expression of Jag1 and the Notch target Hey1 correlates well with lateral induction, whereas both Jag1 and Dl1 are expressed during lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion, as are Notch targets Hey1 and Hes5. Here, we show that Jag1 drives lower levels of Notch activity than Dl1, which results in the differential expression of Hey1 and Hes5. In addition, Jag1 interferes with the ability of Dl1 to elicit high levels of Notch activity. Modeling the sensory epithelium when the two ligands are expressed together shows that ligand regulation, differential signaling strength and ligand competition are crucial to allow the two modes of operation and for establishing the alternate pattern of hair cells and supporting cells. Jag1, while driving lateral induction on its own, facilitates patterning by lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion in the presence of Dl1. This novel behavior emerges from Jag1 acting as a competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or of Dl1 for Notch signaling. Both modeling and experiments show that hair cell patterning is very robust. The model suggests that autoactivation of proneural factor Atoh1, upstream of Dl1, is a fundamental component for robustness. The results stress the importance of the levels of Notch signaling and ligand competition for Notch function.</p>

Residual Inflammatory Risk on Treatment With PCSK9 Inhibition and Statin Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The combination of statin therapy and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion markedly lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduces cardiovascular event rates. Whether residual inflammatory risk as measured by on-treatment high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) remains an important clinical issue in such patients is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We evaluated residual inflammatory risk among 9738 patients participating in the SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2 cardiovascular outcomes trials (Studies of PCSK9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion and the Reduction in Vascular Events), who were receiving both statin therapy and bococizumab, according to on-treatment levels of hsCRP (hsCRP<sub>OT</sub>) and LDL-C<sub>OT</sub> measured 14 weeks after drug initiation. The primary end point was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina requiring urgent revascularization, or cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At 14 weeks, the mean percentage change in LDL-C among statin-treated patients who additionally received bococizumab was −60.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], −61.2 to −59.8; <i>P</i><0.001; median change, −65.4%) as compared to 6.6% (95% CI, −1.0 to 14.1; <i>P</i>=0.09; median change, 0.0%) for hsCRP. Incidence rates for future cardiovascular events for patients treated with both statin therapy and bococizumab according to hsCRP<sub>OT</sub> <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/L were 1.96, 2.50, and 3.59 events per 100 person-years, respectively, corresponding to multivariable adjusted hazard ratios of 1.0, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.81–1.66), and 1.62 (95% CI, 1.14–2.30) (<i>P</i>-trend=0.001) after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and LDL-C<sub>OT</sub>. Comparable adjusted hazard ratios for LDL-C<sub>OT</sub> (<30, 30–50, >50 mg/dL) were 1.0, 0.87, and 1.21, respectively (<i>P</i>-trend=0.16).

Novel Adipokine, FAM19A5, Inhibits Neointima Formation After Injury Through Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 2
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Obesity plays crucial roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanisms that link obesity and cardiovascular diseases remain elusive. Compelling evidence indicates that adipokines play an important role in obesity-related cardiovascular diseases. Here, we found a new adipokine-named family with sequence similarity 19, member A5 (FAM19A5), a protein with unknown function that was predicted to be distantly related to the CC-chemokine family. We aimed to test whether adipose-derived FAM19A5 regulates vascular pathology on injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>DNA cloning, protein expression, purification, and N-terminal sequencing were applied to characterize FAM19A5. Adenovirus infection and siRNA transfection were performed to regulate FAM19A5 expression. Balloon and wire injury were performed in vivo on the rat carotid arteries and mouse femoral arteries, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis, radioactive ligand-receptor binding assays, receptor internalization, and calcium mobilization assays were used to identify the functional receptor for FAM19A5.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We first characterized FAM19A5 as a secreted protein, and the first 43 N-terminal amino acids were the signal peptides. Both FAM19A5 mRNA and protein were abundantly expressed in the adipose tissue but were downregulated in obese mice. Overexpression of FAM19A5 markedly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration and neointima formation in the carotid arteries of balloon-injured rats. Accordingly, FAM19A5 silencing in adipocytes significantly promoted vascular smooth muscle cell activation. Adipose-specific FAM19A5 transgenic mice showed greater attenuation of neointima formation compared with wild-type littermates fed with or without Western-style diet. We further revealed that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 was the functional receptor for FAM19A5, with a dissociation constant (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) of 0.634 nmol/L. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 or its downstream G12/13-RhoA signaling circumvented the suppressive effects of FAM19A5 on vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We revealed that a novel adipokine, FAM19A5, was capable of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing postinjury neointima formation via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2-G12/13-RhoA signaling. Downregulation of FAM19A5 during obesity may trigger cardiometabolic diseases.</p></sec>

CD73 on T Cells Orchestrates Cardiac Wound Healing After Myocardial Infarction by Purinergic Metabolic Reprogramming
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>T cells are required for proper healing after myocardial infarction. The mechanism of their beneficial action, however, is unknown. The proinflammatory danger signal ATP, released from damaged cells, is degraded by the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 to the anti-inflammatory mediator adenosine. Here, we investigate the contribution of CD73-derived adenosine produced by T cells to cardiac remodeling after ischemia/reperfusion and define its mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Myocardial ischemia (50 minutes followed by reperfusion) was induced in global CD73<sup>−/−</sup> and CD4-CD73<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup> mice. Tissue injury, T-cell purinergic signaling, cytokines, and cardiac function (magnetic resonance tomography at 9.4 T over 4 weeks) were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Changes in functional parameters of CD4-CD73<sup>−/−</sup> mice were identical to those in global CD73 knockouts (KOs). T cells infiltrating the injured heart significantly upregulated at the gene (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and protein (enzymatic activity) levels critical transporters and enzymes (connexin43, connexin37, pannexin-1, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1, CD39, CD73, ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3, CD157, CD38) for the accelerated release and hydrolysis of ATP, cAMP, AMP, and NAD to adenosine. It is surprising that a lack of CD39 on T cells (from CD39<sup>−/−</sup> mice) did not alter ATP hydrolysis and very likely involves pyrophosphatases (ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3). Circulating T cells predominantly expressed A<sub>2a</sub> receptor (A<sub>2a</sub>R) transcripts. After myocardial infarction, A<sub>2b</sub> receptor (A<sub>2b</sub>R) transcription was induced in both T cells and myeloid cells in the heart. Thus, A<sub>2a</sub>R and A<sub>2b</sub>R signaling may contribute to myocardial responses after myocardial infarction. In the case of T cells, this was associated with an accelerated secretion of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines (interleukin-2, interferon-γ, and interleukin-17) when CD73 was lacking. Cytokine production by T cells from peripheral lymph nodes was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed by A<sub>2a</sub>R activation (CGS-21680). The A<sub>2b</sub>R agonist BAY 60-6583 showed off-target effects. The adenosine receptor agonist NECA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed interferon-γ and stimulated interleukin-6 production, each of which was antagonized by a specific A<sub>2b</sub>R antagonist (PSB-603).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work demonstrates that CD73 on T cells plays a crucial role in the cardiac wound healing process after myocardial infarction. The underlying mechanism involves a profound increase in the hydrolysis of ATP/NAD and AMP, resulting primarily from the upregulation of pyrophosphatases and CD73. We also define A<sub>2b</sub>R/A<sub>2a</sub>R–mediated autacoid feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of proinflammatory/profibrotic cytokines by T cell–derived CD73.</p></sec>

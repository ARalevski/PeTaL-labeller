Inhibition of somatosensory mechanotransduction by annexin A6
<p>Mechanically activated, slowly adapting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s in sensory neurons have been linked to noxious mechanosensation. The conotoxin NMB-1 (noxious mechanosensation blocker-1) blocks such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s and inhibits mechanical pain. Using a biotinylated form of NMB-1 in mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 67 binding proteins in sensory neurons and a sensory neuron–derived cell line, of which the top candidate was annexin A6, a membrane-associated calcium-binding protein. Annexin A6–deficient mice showed increased sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. Sensory neurons from these mice showed increased activity of the cation channel Piezo2, which mediates a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly adapting mechano-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> linked to proprioception and touch, and a decrease in mechanically activated, slowly adapting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s. Conversely, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory neurons inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly adapting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s that were partially mediated by Piezo2. Furthermore, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory neurons attenuated mechanical pain in a mouse model of osteoarthritis, a disease in which mechanically evoked pain is particularly problematic. These data suggest that annexin A6 can be exploited to inhibit chronic mechanical pain.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> induced by muscarinic stimulation (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by application of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrations (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions and distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>–voltage relationship with a very small inward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> is not affected by either exclusion of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfusion with K<sup>+</sup>-free solution. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> by 95%, when applied into the pipette solution. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activation, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervation.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Actin Reorganization Triggers Rapid Cell Elongation in Roots
<p>Root growth is controlled by mechanisms underlying cell division and cell elongation, which respond to various internal and external factors. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), cells produced in the proximal meristem (PM) elongate and differentiate in the transition zone (TZ) and the elongation/differentiation zone (EDZ). Previous studies have demonstrated that endoreplication is involved in root cell elongation; however, the manner by which cells increase in length by more than 2-fold remains unknown. Here, we show that epidermal and cortical cells in Arabidopsis roots undergo two modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> cell elongation: the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> cell elongation occurs at the border of the proximal meristem and the TZ, and the second mode occurs during the transition from the TZ to the EDZ. Our previous study showed that cytokinin signaling promotes endoreplication, which triggers the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> cell elongation. Our cytological and genetic data revealed that the second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> cell elongation involves dynamic actin reorganization independent of endoreplication. Cytokinins promote actin bundling and the resultant second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> cell elongation through activating the signaling pathway involving the cytokinin receptors ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE3 (AHK3) and AHK4 and the B-type transcription factor ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR2. Our results suggest that cytokinins promote the two modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> cell elongation by controlling distinct cellular events: endoreplication and actin reorganization.</p>

Impact of Smoking on Circulating Cardiac Troponin I Concentrations and Cardiovascular Events in the General Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both tobacco smoking and circulating cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels are associated with the risk of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. However, whether cTnI levels differ according to smoking status and whether smoking modifies the prognostic relationship between cTnI and outcomes remain unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using data from a large, population-based cohort, we assessed the association between smoking and cTnI and the impact of smoking on the associations between cTnI levels and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. cTnI was measured with a high-sensitivity assay in 3824 never smokers, 2341 former smokers, and 2550 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> smokers participating in the prospective observational HUNT Study (Nord-Trøndelag Health Study). All subjects were free from known prior cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The age of the participants ranged from 19 to 94 years; 55.5% were women. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> smokers exhibited significantly lower levels of cTnI (median, 2.9 ng/L; interquartile range, 2.0–4.1 ng/L) than never smokers (3.2 ng/L; interquartile range, 2.2–4.7 ng/L; <i>P</i><0.001) and former smokers (3.4 ng/L; interquartile range, 2.3–5.0 ng/L; <i>P</i><0.001). This association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders (B=−0.098; 95% confidence interval, −0.129 to −0.068). We observed an association between increasing concentrations of cTnI and clinical end points in the total study cohort (adjusted hazard ratio per log unit increase in cTnI, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–1.54). This association was attenuated for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> smokers (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.40) and was significantly weaker than in never/former smokers (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.003). Prognostic accuracy, as assessed by C statistics, was significantly lower in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> smokers than in never smokers (<i>P</i><0.001). In addition, cTnI provided no incremental prognostic information to the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease risk score in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> smokers (<i>P</i>=0.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> smoking is associated with lower concentrations of cTnI, suggesting that substances in tobacco smoke may affect cardiomyocyte injury. The association between cTnI levels and cardiovascular end points is stronger in never/former smokers than in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> smokers, compatible with the theory that the detrimental cardiovascular impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> smoking is mediated via mechanisms other than subclinical myocardial injury.</p></sec>

SOCE mediated by STIM and Orai is essential for pacemaker activity in the interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract
<p>Electrical pacemaker activity generates phasic contractions and motility patterns such as segmentation and peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract. Pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s are generated in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores that stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>−</sup> channels (CaCCs) in the plasma membrane. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores must be maintained to sustain pacemaker activity. Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) facilitates the refilling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by a mechanism dependent upon interactions between STIM and Orai proteins. We investigated the role of SOCE in ICC pacemaker activity. Reintroduction of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in store-depleted ICC resulted in CaCC activation. Blocking CaCCs revealed an inwardly rectifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> with properties of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release–activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub>). An inhibitory pep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tide</span></strong> that interfered with the STIM-Orai interaction blocked <i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub> in HEK 293 cells expressing STIM1 and Orai1 and blocked spontaneous transient inward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s (STICs) and slow wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s in ICC. STICs, which are fundamental pacemaker events in ICC, were blocked by an Orai antagonist. Imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients linked to pacemaker activity in ICC in intact muscles showed that the Orai antagonist blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC. These data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> recovery through STIM-Orai interactions is necessary to maintain ICC pacemaker activity.</p>

Delayed Repolarization Underlies Ventricular Arrhythmias in Rats With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents approximately half of heart failure, and its incidence continues to increase. The leading cause of mortality in HFpEF is sudden death, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) from 7 weeks of age to induce HFpEF (n=38). Rats fed a normal-salt diet (0.3% NaCl) served as controls (n=13). Echocardiograms were performed to assess systolic and diastolic function from 14 weeks of age. HFpEF-verified and control rats underwent programmed electrical stimulation. Corrected QT interval was measured by surface ECG. The mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) were probed by optical mapping, whole-cell patch clamp to measure action potential duration and ionic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to investigate changes in ion channel expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After 7 weeks of a high-salt diet, 31 of 38 rats showed diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction along with signs of heart failure and hence were diagnosed with HFpEF. Programmed electric stimulation demonstrated increased susceptibility to VA in HFpEF rats (<i>P</i><0.001 versus controls). The arrhythmogenicity index was increased (<i>P</i><0.001) and the corrected QT interval on ECG was prolonged (<i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF rats. Optical mapping of HFpEF hearts demonstrated prolonged action potentials (<i>P</i><0.05) and multiple reentry circuits during induced VA. Single-cell recordings of cardiomyocytes isolated from HFpEF rats confirmed a delay of repolarization (<i>P</i>=0.001) and revealed downregulation of transient outward potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>; <i>P</i><0.05). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> components of the delayed rectifier potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>Kr</sub>) and the inward rectifier potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>K1</sub>) were also downregulated (<i>P</i><0.05), but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> densities were much lower than for <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>.

Counter-propagating charge transport in the quantum Hall effect regime
<p>The quantum Hall effect, observed in a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field, imposes a 1D-like chiral, downstream, transport of charge carriers along the sample edges. Although this picture remains valid for electrons and Laughlin’s fractional quasiparticles, it no longer holds for quasiparticles in the so-called hole-conjugate states. These states are expected, when disorder and interactions are weak, to harbor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> charge modes. However, so far, charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s were observed to flow exclusively downstream in the quantum Hall regime. Studying the canonical spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized <i>v</i> = 2/3 hole-like states in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures, we observed a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> at short propagation distances in the spin unpolarized state.</p>

Imaging of pure spin-valley diffusion current in WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures
<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials are promising for spintronic and valleytronic applications because valley-polarized excitations can be generated and manipulated with circularly polarized photons and the valley and spin degrees of freedom are locked by strong spin-orbital interactions. In this study we demonstrate efficient generation of a pure and locked spin-valley diffusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> in tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>)–tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) heterostructures without any driving electric field. We imaged the propagation of valley <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> in real time and space by pump-probe spectroscopy. The valley <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> in the heterostructures can live for more than 20 microseconds and propagate over 20 micrometers; both the lifetime and the diffusion length can be controlled through electrostatic gating. The high-efficiency and electric-field–free generation of a locked spin-valley <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> in TMDC heterostructures holds promise for applications in spin and valley devices.</p>

Large Numbers of Novel miRNAs Originate from DNA Transposons and Are Coincident with a Large Species Radiation in Bats
<p>Vesper bats (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> adaptive radiation beginning around 36 Ma that resulted in the second most species-rich mammalian family (>400 species). Coincident with that radiation was an initial burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present in some species. Such extensive and recent DNA transposon activity has not been seen in any other extant mammal. Indeed, retrotransposon activity is much more common in all other sequenced mammal genomes. Deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction from a vespertilionid bat, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, as well as a dog and horse revealed large numbers of 17–24 bp putative miRNAs (p/miRNAs). Although the origination rate of p/miRNAs is similar in all three taxa, 61.1% of postdivergence p/miRNAs in <i>Eptesicus</i> are derived from transposable elements (TEs) compared with only 23.9% and 16.5% in the dog and horse, respectively. Not surprisingly, given the retrotransposon bias of dog and horse, the majority of TE-derived p/miRNAs are associated with retrotransposons. In <i>Eptesicus</i>, however, 58.7% of the TE-derived and 35.9% of the total p/miRNAs arose not from retrotransposons but from bat-specific DNA transposons. Notably, we observe that the timing of the DNA transposon expansion and the resulting introduction of novel p/miRNAs coincide with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> diversification of the family Vespertilionidae. Furthermore, potential targets of the DNA transposon-derived p/miRNAs are identifiable and enriched for genes that are important for regulation of transcription. We propose that lineage-specific DNA transposon activity lead to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> and repeated introduction of novel p/miRNAs. Some of these p/miRNAs are likely functional miRNAs and potentially influenced the diversification of Vespertilionidae. Our observations suggest a mechanism for introducing functional genomic variation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly through the expansion of DNA transposons that fits within the TE-thrust hypothesis.</p>

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C allocation to both reproductive and vegetative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in fruiting and non-fruiting trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of reproduction on C allocation to vegetative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting trees, fruiting reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting trees than non-fruiting trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of allocation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C allocation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Selective control of up-regulated and down-regulated genes by temporal patterns and doses of insulin
<p>Secretion of insulin transiently increases after eating, resulting in a high circulating concentration. Fasting limits insulin secretion, resulting in a low concentration of insulin in the circulation. We analyzed transcriptional responses to different temporal patterns and doses of insulin in the hepatoma FAO cells and identified 13 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated insulin-responsive genes (IRGs). The up-regulated IRGs responded more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly than did the down-regulated IRGs to transient stepwise or pulsatile increases in insulin concentration, whereas the down-regulated IRGs were repressed at lower concentrations of insulin than those required to stimulate the up-regulated IRGs. Mathematical modeling of the insulin response as two stages—(i) insulin signaling to transcription and (ii)transcription and mRNA stability—indicated that the first stage was the more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> stage for the down-regulated IRGs, whereas the second stage of transcription was the more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> stage for the up-regulated IRGs. A subset of the IRGs that were up-regulated or down-regulated in the FAO cells was similarly regulated in the livers of rats injected with a single dose of insulin. Thus, not only can cells respond to insulin but they can also interpret the intensity and pattern of signal to produce distinct transcriptional responses. These results provide insight that may be useful in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes associated with aberrant insulin production or tissue responsiveness.</p>

Coordinating the overall stomatal response of plants: Rapid leaf-to-leaf communication during light stress
<p>The plant canopy functions as an aerial array of light-harvesting antennas. To achieve maximal yield, each leaf within this array and the array as a whole need to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly adjust to naturally occurring fluctuations in light intensity and quality. Excessive light stress triggers the closing of pores in leaves called stomata to minimize moisture loss. We found that different leaves within the canopy of an <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plant, including leaves not directly exposed to light, coordinated stomatal closure in response to light stress by sending and receiving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> systemic signals. This response required the plant hormones abscisic acid and jasmonic acid and was mediated by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> autopropagating wave of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, this response depended on the function of genes encoding the ROS-generating NADPH oxidase RBOHD and various stomatal regulators, such as the anion channel SLAC1, GHR1 (guard cell hydrogen peroxide resistant 1), and lipoxygenase 1 (LOX1). Our findings reveal that plants function as highly dynamic and coordinated organisms, optimizing the overall response of their canopies to fluctuating light intensities.</p>

Dampening oncogenic RAS signaling
<p>The control of normal cellular homeostasis is a function of signaling by the RAS guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS and their downstream signaling proteins, such as the RAF kinases (BRAF and CRAF), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), which together constitute the RAS-MAPK pathway (<i>1</i>). This pathway is dysregulated in human diseases, particularly cancer, in which mutations or other nongenetic events hyperactivate the pathway in more than 50% of cases (<i>1</i>). Activating mutations in RAS genes occur in more than 30% of all cancers and seemingly lock RAS into a constitutively active, GTP-bound state to signal autonomously without the need for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> input (<i>1</i>). Therapeutic suppression of pathogenic RASMAPK signaling to maximize disease control in cancer patients remains an elusive goal. Multiple strategies targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> [e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)] or downstream (e.g., MEK) RAS pathway proteins to limit RAS-GTP–mediated signaling in RAS-MAPK pathway–driven cancers are under evaluation (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). However, recent studies have extended our knowledge of how certain forms of oncogenic RAS and other oncogenic MAPK pathway proteins function not in an autonomous manner but instead semiautonomously, such that they still respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> regulation (<i>4</i>–<i>8</i>). These findings reveal mechanisms by which RAS signaling is dysregulated in cancer and highlight newly identified therapeutic strategies with the potential to target oncogenic RAS-MAPK signaling.</p>

Dirac-source field-effect transistors as energy-efficient, high-performance electronic switches
<p>An efficient way to reduce the power consumption of electronic devices is to lower the supply voltage, but this voltage is restricted by the thermionic limit of subthreshold swing (SS), 60 millivolts per decade, in field-effect transistors (FETs). We show that a graphene Dirac source (DS) with a much narrower electron density distribution around the Fermi level than that of conventional FETs can lower SS. A DS-FET with a carbon nanotube channel provided an average SS of 40 millivolts per decade over four decades of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> at room temperature and high device <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> <i>I</i><sub>60</sub> of up to 40 microamperes per micrometer at 60 millivolts per decade. When compared with state-of-the-art silicon 14-nanometer node FETs, a similar on-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> <i>I</i><sub>on</sub> is realized but at a much lower supply voltage of 0.5 volts (versus 0.7 volts for silicon) and a much steeper SS below 35 millivolts per decade in the off-state.</p>

Self-heating–induced healing of lithium dendrites
<p>Lithium (Li) metal electrodes are not deployable in rechargeable batteries because electrochemical plating and stripping invariably leads to growth of dendrites that reduce coulombic efficiency and eventually short the battery. It is generally accepted that the dendrite problem is exacerbated at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> densities. Here, we report a regime for dendrite evolution in which the reverse is true. In our experiments, we found that when the plating and stripping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> density is raised above ~9 milliamperes per square centimeter, there is substantial self-heating of the dendrites, which triggers extensive surface migration of Li. This surface diffusion heals the dendrites and smoothens the Li metal surface. We show that repeated doses of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>-density healing treatment enables the safe cycling of Li-sulfur batteries with high coulombic efficiency.</p>

Current-induced strong diamagnetism in the Mott insulator Ca<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>
<p>Mott insulators can host a surprisingly diverse set of quantum phenomena when their frozen electrons are perturbed by various stimuli. Superconductivity, metal-insulator transition, and colossal magnetoresistance induced by element substitution, pressure, and magnetic field are prominent examples. Here we report strong diamagnetism in the Mott insulator calcium ruthenate (Ca<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>) induced by dc electric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>. The application of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> density of merely 1 ampere per centimeter squared induces diamagnetism stronger than that in other nonsuperconducting materials. This change is coincident with changes in the transport properties as the system becomes semimetallic. These findings suggest that dc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> may be a means to control the properties of materials in the vicinity of a Mott insulating transition.</p>

Decoupled ecomorphological evolution and diversification in Neogene-Quaternary horses
<p>Evolutionary theory has long proposed a connection between trait evolution and diversification rates. In this work, we used phylogenetic methods to evaluate the relationship of lineage-specific speciation rates and the mode of evolution of body size and tooth morphology in the Neogene and Quaternary radiation of horses (7 living and 131 extinct species). We show that diversification pulses are a re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> feature of equid evolution but that these pulses are not correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> bursts in phenotypic evolution. Instead, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> cladogenesis seems repeatedly associated with extrinsic factors that relaxed diversity bounds, such as increasing productivity and geographic dispersals into the Old World. This evidence suggests that diversity dynamics in Equinae were controlled mainly by ecological limits under diversity dependence rather than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> ecomorphological differentiation.</p>

Evolution of protein phosphorylation across 18 fungal species
<p>Living organisms have evolved protein phosphorylation, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> and versatile mechanism that drives signaling and regulates protein function. We report the phosphoproteomes of 18 fungal species and a phylogenetic-based approach to study phosphosite evolution. We observe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> divergence, with only a small fraction of phosphosites conserved over hundreds of millions of years. Relative to recently acquired phosphosites, ancient sites are enriched at protein interfaces and are more likely to be functionally important, as we show for sites on H2A1 and eIF4E. We also observe a change in phosphorylation motif frequencies and kinase activities that coincides with the whole-genome duplication event. Our results provide an evolutionary history for phosphosites and suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> evolution of phosphorylation can contribute strongly to phenotypic diversity.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> resuscitation.</p>

A New Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus Allows Large Protein Overexpression for Rapid Function Analysis
<p>Understanding the genetic and molecular bases of gene function is of increasing importance to harness their potential to produce plants with novel traits. One important objective is the improvement of plant productivity to meet future demands in food crop production. Gene function is mostly characterized through overexpression or silencing in transgenic plants. This approach is a lengthy procedure, especially in cereals. Plant viral expression systems can be used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> expression of proteins. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> systems have a small cargo capacity and have mostly been used for gene silencing. Here, a four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based system with high cargo capacity was constructed for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> and stable expression of recombinant proteins in different plant species, allowing function analyses at different stages of development. Fluorescent marker proteins are expressed at high levels within 1 week, and a proof of efficient function analysis is shown using the aluminum malate transporter1 gene. In addition to the ability of gene cotransformation, this work demonstrates that the four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based system allows the overexpression of cDNAs of up to 2,100 nucleo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tide</span></strong>s (encoding a protein of ∼78 kD), thereby providing an invaluable tool to accelerate functional genomics and proteomic research in monocot and dicot species.</p>

The Impacts of Fluctuating Light on Crop Performance
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly changing light conditions can reduce carbon gain and productivity in field crops because photosynthetic responses to light fluctuations are not instantaneous. Plant responses to fluctuating light occur across levels of organizational complexity from entire canopies to the biochemistry of a single reaction and across orders of magnitude of time. Although light availability and variation at the top of the canopy are largely dependent on the solar angle and degree of cloudiness, lower crop canopies rely more heavily on light in the form of sunflecks, the quantity of which depends mostly on canopy structure but also may be affected by wind. The ability of leaf photosynthesis to respond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly to these variations in light intensity is restricted by the relatively slow opening/closing of stomata, activation/deactivation of C<sub>3</sub> cycle enzymes, and up-regulation/down-regulation of photoprotective processes. The metabolic complexity of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis creates the apparently contradictory possibilities that C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis may be both more and less resilient than C<sub>3</sub> to dynamic light regimes, depending on the frequency at which these light fluctuations occur. We review the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these limitations to photosynthesis in fluctuating light that have shown promise in improving the response times of photosynthesis-related processes to changes in light intensity.</p>

Protoplast Swelling and Hypocotyl Growth Depend on Different Auxin Signaling Pathways
<p>Members of the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN (TIR1/AFB) family are known auxin receptors. To analyze the possible receptor function of AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1), an auxin receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>ly under debate, we performed different approaches. We performed a pharmacological approach using α-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (auxinole), α-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-acetic acid (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We used a pep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tide</span></strong> of the carboxyl-terminal region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of <i>ABP1</i>, <i>abp1-c1</i> and <i>abp1-TD1</i>, and the TILLING mutant <i>abp1-5</i>. We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino acid exchange in the auxin-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl growth, both at high temporal resolution. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast swelling; instead, it showed auxin activity in the hypocotyl growth test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an auxin-like swelling response but no hypocotyl growth. The carboxyl-terminal pep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tide</span></strong> of AtABP1 induced an auxin-like swelling response. In the <i>ABP1</i>-related mutants and Coimbra, no auxin-induced protoplast swelling occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> auxin-induced protoplast swelling, but it is not involved in the control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> auxin-induced growth.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In addition, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG accumulation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in addition to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

MAP Kinase PrMPK9-1 Contributes to the Self-Incompatibility Response
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) form important signaling modules for a variety of cellular responses in eukaryotic cells. In plants, MAPKs play key roles in growth and development as well as in immunity/stress responses. Pollen-pistil interactions are critical early events regulating pollination and fertilization and involve many signaling events. Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism to prevent self-fertilization and inbreeding in higher plants and also is known to utilize signaling to achieve incompatible pollen rejection. Although several pollen-expressed MAPKs exist, very little is known about their function. We previously identified a pollen-expressed MAPK (p56) from <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> that was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly activated during SI; several studies implicated its role in signaling to SI-induced programmed cell death involving a DEVDase. However, to date, the identity of the MAPK involved has been unknown. Here, we have identified and cloned a pollen-expressed <i>P. rhoeas</i> threonine-aspartate-tyrosine (TDY) MAPK, <i>PrMPK9-1</i>. Rather few data relating to the function of TDY MAPKs in plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>ly exist. We provide evidence that <i>PrMPK9-1</i> has a cell type-specific function, with a distinct role from <i>AtMPK9</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first study implicating a function for a TDY MAPK in pollen. We show that PrMPK9-1 corresponds to p56 and demonstrate that it is functionally involved in mediating SI in <i>P. rhoeas</i> pollen: PrMPK9-1 is a key regulator for SI in pollen and acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of programmed cell death involving actin and activation of a DEVDase. Our study provides an important advance in elucidating functional roles for this class of MAPKs.</p>

Boron-Dependent Translational Suppression of the Borate Exporter <i>BOR1</i> Contributes to the Avoidance of Boron Toxicity
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants; however, as high B concentrations are toxic, B transport must be tightly regulated. BOR1 is a borate exporter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that facilitates B translocation into shoots under B deficiency conditions. When the B supply is sufficient, <i>BOR1</i> expression is down-regulated by selective degradation of BOR1 protein, while additional <i>BOR1</i> regulatory mechanisms are proposed to exist. In this study, we identified a novel B-dependent <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression mechanism. In vivo and in vitro reporter assays demonstrated that <i>BOR1</i> translation was reduced in a B-dependent manner and that the 5′-untranslated region was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Mutational analysis revealed that multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> open reading frames in the 5′-untranslated region were required for <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression, and this process depended on the efficiency of translational reinitiation at the <i>BOR1</i> open reading frame after translation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> open reading frames. To understand the physiological significance of <i>BOR1</i> regulation, we characterized transgenic plants defective in either one or both of the <i>BOR1</i> regulation mechanisms. <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression was induced at higher B concentrations than those triggering BOR1 degradation. Plants lacking both regulation mechanisms exhibited more severe shoot growth reduction under high-B conditions than did plants lacking BOR1 degradation alone, thus demonstrating the importance of <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression. This study demonstrates that two mechanisms of posttranscriptional <i>BOR1</i> regulation, each induced under different B concentrations, contribute to the avoidance of B toxicity in plants.</p>

Darkened Leaves Use Different Metabolic Strategies for Senescence and Survival
<p>In plants, an individually darkened leaf initiates senescence much more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly than a leaf from a whole darkened plant. Combining transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we present an overview of the metabolic strategies that are employed in response to different darkening treatments. Under darkened plant conditions, the perception of carbon starvation drove a profound metabolic readjustment in which branched-chain amino acids and potentially monosaccharides released from cell wall loosening became important substrates for maintaining minimal ATP production. Concomitantly, the increased accumulation of amino acids with a high nitrogen-carbon ratio may provide a safety mechanism for the storage of metabolically derived cytotoxic ammonium and a pool of nitrogen for use upon returning to typical growth conditions. Conversely, in individually darkened leaf, the metabolic profiling that followed our <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment assays revealed a temporal and differential exchange of metabolites, including sugars and amino acids, between the darkened leaf and the rest of the plant. This active transport could be the basis for a progressive metabolic shift in the substrates fueling mitochondrial activities, which are central to the catabolic reactions facilitating the retrieval of nutrients from the senescing leaf. We propose a model illustrating the specific metabolic strategies employed by leaves in response to these two darkening treatments, which support either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> senescence or a strong capacity for survival.</p>

Control of Retrograde Signaling by Rapid Turnover of GENOMES UNCOUPLED1
<p>The exchange of signals between cellular compartments coordinates development and differentiation, modulates metabolic pathways, and triggers responses to environmental conditions. The proposed central regulator of plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, GENOMES UNCOUPLED1 (GUN1), is present at very low levels, which has hampered the discovery of its precise molecular function. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GUN1 protein accumulates to detectable levels only at very early stages of leaf development, where it functions in the regulation of chloroplast biogenesis. <i>GUN1</i> mRNA is present at high levels in all tissues, but GUN1 protein undergoes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> degradation (with an estimated half-life of ∼4 h) in all tissues where chloroplast biogenesis has been completed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> turnover of GUN1 is controlled mainly by the chaperone ClpC1, suggesting degradation of GUN1 by the Clp protease. Degradation of GUN1 slows under stress conditions that alter retrograde signaling, thus ensuring that the plant has sufficient GUN1 protein. We also find that the pentatricopep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tide</span></strong> repeat motifs of GUN1 are important determinants of GUN1 stability. Moreover, overexpression of <i>GUN1</i> causes an early flowering phenotype, suggesting a function of GUN1 in developmental phase transitions beyond chloroplast biogenesis. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the regulation of GUN1 by proteolytic degradation, uncover its function in early chloroplast biogenesis, and suggest a role in developmental phase transitions.</p>

Ethylene Signaling Modulates Cortical Microtubule Reassembly in Response to Salt Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Regulation of cortical microtubule reorganization is essential for plant cell survival under high salinity conditions. In response to salt stress, microtubules undergo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> depolymerization followed by reassembly to form a new microtubule network that promotes cell survival; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> regulatory mechanisms for this recovery response are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that ethylene signaling facilitates salt stress-induced reassembly of cortical microtubules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Microtubule depolymerization was not affected under salt stress following the suppression of ethylene signaling with Ag<sup>+</sup> or in ethylene-insensitive mutants, whereas microtubule reassembly was significantly inhibited. ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3, a key transcription factor in the ethylene signaling pathway, was shown to play a central role in microtubule reassembly under salt stress. In addition, we performed functional characterization of the microtubule-stabilizing protein WAVE-DAMPENED2-LIKE5 (WDL5), which was found to promote ethylene-associated microtubule reassembly and plant salt stress tolerance. These findings indicate that ethylene signaling regulates microtubule reassembly by up-regulating <i>WDL5</i> expression in response to salt stress, thereby implicating ethylene signaling in salt-stress tolerance in plants.</p>

Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>ly thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>

A SIMPLE Pipeline for Mapping Point Mutations
<p>A forward genetic screen is one of the best methods for revealing the function of genes. In plants, this technique is highly efficient, as it is relatively easy to grow and screen hundreds or thousands of individuals. The cost efficiency and ease of data production afforded by next-generation sequencing have created new opportunities for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> mapping of induced mutations. Current mapping tools are often not user friendly, are complicated, or require extensive preparation steps. To simplify the process of mapping new mutations, we developed a pipeline that takes next-generation sequencing fastq files as input, calls on several well-established and freely available genome-analysis tools, and outputs the most likely causal DNA changes. The pipeline has been validated in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (Arabidopsis) and can be readily applied to other species, with the possibility of mapping either dominant or recessive mutations.</p>

Transcription Factors PvERF15 and PvMTF-1 Form a Cadmium Stress Transcriptional Pathway
<p>In plants, cadmium (Cd)-responsive transcription factors are key downstream effectors of Cd stress transcriptional pathways, which are capable of converging Cd stress signals through triggering the expression of Cd detoxification genes. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> transcriptional regulatory pathways that modulate their responses to Cd are less clear. Previously, we identified the bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) METAL RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (PvMTF-1) that responds to Cd and confers Cd tolerance in planta. Here, we demonstrate an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> transcriptional regulation of the <i>PvMTF-1</i> response to Cd. Using a yeast one-hybrid system, we cloned the bean ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR15 (PvERF15) that binds to the <i>PvMTF-1</i> promoter. <i>PvERF15</i> was strongly induced by Cd stress, and its overexpression resulted in the up-regulation of <i>PvMTF-1</i>. DNA-protein interaction assays further revealed that PvERF15 binds directly to a 19-bp AC-rich element in the <i>PvMTF-1</i> promoter. The AC-rich element serves as a positive element bound by PvERF15 to activate gene expression. More importantly, knockdown of <i>PvERF15</i> by RNA interference resulted in reduced Cd-induced expression of <i>PvMTF-1</i>. <i>PvERF15</i> seems to be involved in Cd tolerance, since knockdown of <i>PvERF15</i> by RNA interference in bean leaf discs decreased Cd tolerance in a transient assay. Since PvERF15 is a component of the Cd stress transcriptional pathway in beans and <i>PvMTF-1</i> is one of its downstream targets, our findings provide a PvERF15/PvMTF-1 transcriptional pathway and thereby contribute to the understanding of Cd stress transcriptional regulatory pathways in plants.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> measurements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were measured with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside measurements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a measure of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for measured and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional measurements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) Regulates Cell Walls in the Leaf Epidermis
<p>The plant epidermis is crucial to survival, regulating interactions with the environment and controlling plant growth. The phytocalpain DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) is a master regulator of epidermal differentiation and maintenance, acting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of epidermis-specific transcription factors, and is required for correct cell adhesion. It is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>ly unclear how changes in DEK1 lead to cellular defects in the epidermis and the pathways through which DEK1 acts. We have combined growth kinematic studies, cell wall analysis, and transcriptional analysis of genes downstream of DEK1 to determine the cause of phenotypic changes observed in DEK1-modulated lines of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We reveal a novel role for DEK1 in the regulation of leaf epidermal cell wall structure. Lines with altered DEK1 activity have epidermis-specific changes in the thickness and polysaccharide composition of cell walls that likely underlie the loss of adhesion between epidermal cells in plants with reduced levels of DEK1 and changes in leaf shape and size in plants constitutively overexpressing the active CALPAIN domain of DEK1. Calpain-overexpressing plants also have increased levels of cellulose and pectins in epidermal cell walls, and this is correlated with the expression of several cell wall-related genes, linking transcriptional regulation downstream of DEK1 with cellular effects. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the role of the epidermal cell walls in growth regulation and establish a new role for DEK1 in pathways regulating epidermal cell wall deposition and remodeling.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Ultrafast Approximation for Phylogenetic Bootstrap
<p>Nonparametric bootstrap has been a widely used tool in phylogenetic analysis to assess the clade support of phylogenetic trees. However, with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly growing amount of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, approximation methods such as the RAxML <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to compute the support of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch support values to automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate trees. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66–33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32–41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the support values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap support. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at <ext-link>http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree</ext-link>) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive radiations on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such radiations remain unclear. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> morphological and ecological evolution during island radiations suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong selection, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive selection. Positively selected genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying selection and more widespread positive selection in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive radiations.</p>

Changes in protein expression in the salt marsh mussel <i>Geukensia demissa</i>: evidence for a shift from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism during prolonged aerial exposure
<p>During aerial exposure (emersion), most sessile intertidal invertebrates experience cellular stress caused by hypoxia, and the amount and types of hypoxia-induced stress will differ as exposure time increases, likely leading to altered metabolic responses. We examined proteomic responses to increasing emersion times and decreasing recovery (immersion) times in the mussel <i>Geukensia demissa</i>, which occurs in salt marshes along the east coast of North America. Individuals are found above mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tide</span></strong> level, and can be emersed for over 18 h during spring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tide</span></strong>s. We acclimated mussels to full immersion at 15°C for 4 weeks, and compared changes in gill protein expression between groups of mussels that were continually immersed (control), were emersed for 6 h and immersed during recovery for 18 h (6E/18R), were emersed for 12 h and recovered for 12 h (12E/12R), or were emersed for 18 h with a 6 h recovery (18E/6R). We found clear differences in protein expression patterns among the treatments. Proteins associated with anaerobic fermentation increased in abundance in 6E/18R but not in 12E/12R or 18E/6R. Increases in oxidative stress proteins were most apparent in 12E/12R, and in 18E/6R changes in cytoskeletal protein expression predominated. We conclude that <i>G. demissa</i> alters its strategy for coping with emersion stress over time, relying on anaerobic metabolism for short- to medium-duration exposure, but switching to an air-gaping strategy for long-term exposure, which reduces hypoxia stress but may cause structural damage to gill tissue.</p>

Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives
<p>Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of oxygen store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) while diving. We investigated dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in five adult female California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min<sup>−1</sup>), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> below resting (<54 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) at some point during the dive. Both dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and minimum instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> decline in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> resulting in the lowest instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min<sup>−1</sup> in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> to ~10–40 beats min<sup>−1</sup> during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> during ascent with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> increase prior to surfacing. Thus, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung oxygen store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound oxygen store, (c) conserve the blood oxygen store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.</p>

The effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
<p>The effects of flight behavior on physiology and senescence may be profound in insects because of the extremely high metabolic costs of flight. Flight capacity in insects decreases with age; in contrast, limiting flight behavior extends lifespan and slows the age-related loss of antioxidant capacity and accumulation of oxidative damage in flight muscles. In this study, we tested the effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity by measuring wingbeat frequency, the ability to fly in a hypo-dense gas mixture, and metabolic rate in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Specifically, 5-day-old adult flies were separated into three life-long treatments: (1) those not allowed to fly (no flight), (2) those allowed – but not forced – to fly (voluntary flight) and (3) those mechanically stimulated to fly (induced flight). Flight capacity senesced earliest in flies from the no-flight treatment, followed by the induced-flight group and then the voluntary flight group. Wingbeat frequency senesced with age in all treatment groups, but was most apparent in the voluntary- and induced-flight groups. Metabolic rate during agitated flight senesced earliest and most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly in the induced flight group, and was low and uniform throughout age in the no-flight group. Early senescence in the induced-flight group was likely due to the acceleration of deleterious aging phenomena such as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> accumulation of damage at the cellular level, while the early loss of flight capacity and low metabolic rates in the no-flight group demonstrate that disuse effects can also significantly alter senescence patterns of whole-insect performance.</p>

The functional role of caudal and anal/dorsal fins during the C-start of a bluegill sunfish
<p>Fast starts are crucial in the survival of aquatic swimmers to capture prey or avoid predators. Currently, it is widely accepted that during C-starts: (1) the caudal fin generates a considerable hydrodynamic force; and (2) anal/dorsal fins are erected to significantly increase the hydrodynamic force. In this work, the above hypotheses on the role of fins during C-starts are studied using experimentally guided numerical simulations of four bluegill sunfish, whose fins are removed or erected. The amount of force created by the body and fins at each time instant was not constant and varied during the C-start. Nevertheless, in agreement with hypothesis (1), up to 70% of the instantaneous hydrodynamic force was generated by the tail during Stage 2 of the C-start, when the sunfish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly bends out of the C-shape. Additionally, the contribution in Stage 1, when the sunfish bends into a C-shape, is less than 20% at each instant. Most of the force in Stage 1 was produced by the body of the sunfish. In contrast to hypothesis (2), the effect of erection/removal of the fins was less than 5% of the instantaneous force in both Stages 1 and 2, except for a short period of time (2 ms) just before Stage 2. However, it is known that the anal/dorsal fins are actively controlled during the C-start from muscle activity measurements. Based on the results presented here, it is suggested that the active control of the anal/dorsal fins can be related to retaining the stability of the sunfish against roll and pitch movements during the C-start. Furthermore, the erection of the fins increases the moment of inertia to make the roll and pitch movements more difficult.</p>

Rapid mitochondrial adjustments in response to short-term hypoxia and re-oxygenation in the Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>
<p>As oxygen concentrations in marine coastal habitats can fluctuate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong>ly and drastically, sessile marine organisms such as the oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> can experience marked and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rapid</span></strong> oxygen variations. In this study, we investigated the responses of oyster gill mitochondria to short-term hypoxia (3 and 12 h, at 1.7 mg O<sub>2</sub> l<sup>−1</sup>) and subsequent re-oxygenation. Mitochondrial respiratory rates (states 3 and 4 stimulated by glutamate) and phosphorylation efficiency [respiratory control ratio (RCR) and the relationship between ADP and oxygen consumption (ADP/O)] were measured. Cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (CCO) activity and cytochrome concentrations (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>c</i>) were measured to investigate the rearrangements of respiratory chain subunits. The potential implication of an alternative oxidase (AOX) was investigated using an inhibitor of the respiratory chain (antimycin A) and through gene expression analysis in gills and digestive gland. Results indicate a downregulation of mitochondrial capacity, with 60% inhibition of respiratory rates after 12 h of hypoxia. RCR remained stable, while ADP/O increased after 12 h of hypoxia and 1 h of re-oxygenation, suggesting increased phosphorylation efficiency. CCO showed a fast and remarkable increase of its catalytic activity only after 3 h of hypoxia. AOX mRNA levels showed similar patterns in gills and digestive gland, and were upregulated after 12 and 24 h of hypoxia and during re-oxygenation. Results suggest a set of controls regulating mitochondrial functions in response to oxygen fluctuations, and demonstrate the fast and extreme plasticity of oyster mitochondria in response to oxygen variations.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding butterflies.</p>

Templated nanofiber synthesis via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystalline films
<p>Extrusion, electrospinning, and microdrawing are widely used to create fibrous polymer mats, but these approaches offer limited access to oriented arrays of nanometer-scale fibers with controlled size, shape, and lateral organization. We show that chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong> polymerization can be performed on surfaces coated with thin films of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> crystals to synthesize organized assemblies of end-attached polymer nanofibers. The process uses low concentrations of radical monomers formed initially in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> and then diffused into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-crystal template. This minimizes monomer-induced changes to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> and enables access to nanofiber arrays with complex yet precisely defined structures and compositions. The nanofiber arrays permit tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, including adhesion that depends on nanofiber chirality.</p>

A liquid phase of synapsin and lipid vesicles
<p>Neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles (SVs) form tight clusters at synapses. These clusters act as a reservoir from which SVs are drawn for exocytosis during sustained activity. Several components associated with SVs that are likely to help form such clusters have been reported, including synapsin. Here we found that synapsin can form a distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phas</span></strong>e in an aqueous environment. Other scaffolding proteins could coassemble into this condensate but were not necessary for its formation. Importantly, the synapsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> could capture small lipid vesicles. The synapsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> rapidly disassembled upon phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, mimicking the dispersion of synapsin 1 that occurs at presynaptic sites upon stimulation. Thus, principles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phas</span></strong>e separation may apply to the clustering of SVs at synapses.</p>

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins
<p>Prion-like RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP43 and FUS are largely soluble in the nucleus but form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> pathological aggregates when mislocalized to the cytoplasm. What keeps these proteins soluble in the nucleus and promotes aggregation in the cytoplasm is still unknown. We report here that RNA critically regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> behavior of prion-like RBPs. Low RNA/protein ratios promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation and the formation of cytotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> transitions.</p>

An on/off Berry phase switch in circular graphene resonators
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> of a quantum state may not return to its original value after the system’s parameters cycle around a closed path; instead, the wave function may acquire a measurable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> difference called the Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>. Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s typically have been accessed through interference experiments. Here, we demonstrate an unusual Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>–induced spectroscopic feature: a sudden and large increase in the energy of angular-momentum states in circular graphene p-n junction resonators when a relatively small critical magnetic field is reached. This behavior results from turning on a π Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> associated with the topological properties of Dirac fermions in graphene. The Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> can be switched on and off with small magnetic field changes on the order of 10 millitesla, potentially enabling a variety of optoelectronic graphene device applications.</p>

Terahertz field–induced ferroelectricity in quantum paraelectric SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
<p>“Hidden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s” are metastable collective states of matter that are typically not accessible on equilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> diagram</span></strong>s. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s can host exotic properties in otherwise conventional materials and hence may enable novel functionality and applications, but their discovery and access are still in early stages. Using intense terahertz electric field excitation, we found that an ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> transition into a hidden ferroelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> can be dynamically induced in quantum paraelectric strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>). The induced lowering in crystal symmetry yields substantial changes in the phonon excitation spectra.

Chemically reversible isomerization of inorganic clusters
<p>Structural transformations in molecules and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s have generally been studied in isolation, whereas intermediate systems have eluded characterization. We show that a pair of cadmium sulfide (CdS) cluster isomers provides an advantageous experimental platform to study isomerization in well-defined, atomically precise systems. The clusters coherently interconvert over an ~1–electron volt energy barrier with a 140–milli–electron volt shift in their excitonic energy gaps. There is a diffusionless, displacive reconfiguration of the inorganic core (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> transformation) with first order (isomerization-like) transformation kinetics. Driven by a distortion of the ligand-binding motifs, the presence of hydroxyl species changes the surface energy via physisorption, which determines “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>” stability in this system. This reaction possesses essential characteristics of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> transformations and molecular isomerizations and bridges these disparate length scales.</p>

mRNA structure determines specificity of a polyQ-driven phase separation
<p>RNA promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phas</span></strong>e separation (LLPS) to build membraneless compartments in cells. How distinct molecular compositions are established and maintained in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> compartments is unknown. Here, we report that secondary structure allows messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to self-associate and determines whether an mRNA is recruited to or excluded from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> compartments. The polyQ-protein Whi3 induces conformational changes in RNA structure and generates distinct molecular fluctuations depending on the RNA sequence. These data support a model in which structure-based, RNA-RNA interactions promote assembly of distinct droplets and protein-driven, conformational dynamics of the RNA maintain this identity. Thus, the shape of RNA can promote the formation and coexistence of the diverse array of RNA-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> compartments found in a single cell.</p>

Emission of volatile organic compounds from petunia flowers is facilitated by an ABC transporter
<p>Plants synthesize a diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>e molecules that are important for reproduction and defense, serve as practical products for humans, and influence atmospheric chemistry and climate. Despite progress in deciphering plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>e biosynthesis, their release from the cell has been poorly understood. The default assumption has been that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>es passively diffuse out of cells. By characterization of a <i>Petunia hybrida</i> adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette (ABC) transporter, PhABCG1, we demonstrate that passage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>es across the plasma membrane relies on active transport. <i>PhABCG1</i> down-regulation by RNA interference results in decreased emission of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>es, which accumulate to toxic levels in the plasma membrane. This study provides direct proof of a biologically mediated mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>e emission.</p>

Establishment of Photosynthesis through Chloroplast Development Is Controlled by Two Distinct Regulatory Phases
<p>Chloroplasts develop from undifferentiated proplastids present in meristematic tissue. Thus, chloroplast biogenesis is closely connected to leaf development, which restricts our ability to study the process of chloroplast biogenesis per se. As a consequence, we know relatively little about the regulatory mechanisms behind the establishment of the photosynthetic reactions and how the activities of the two genomes involved are coordinated during chloroplast development. We developed a single cell-based experimental system from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with high temporal resolution allowing for investigations of the transition from proplastids to functional chloroplasts. Using this unique cell line, we could show that the establishment of photosynthesis is dependent on a regulatory mechanism involving two distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. The first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> is triggered by rapid light-induced changes in gene expression and the metabolome. The second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> is dependent on the activation of the chloroplast and generates massive changes in the nuclear gene expression required for the transition to photosynthetically functional chloroplasts. The second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> also is associated with a spatial transition of the chloroplasts from clusters around the nucleus to the final position at the cell cortex. Thus, the establishment of photosynthesis is a two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> process with a clear checkpoint associated with the second regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> allowing coordination of the activities of the nuclear and plastid genomes.</p>

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The binding of DNA to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which activates innate immune responses. We have shown that DNA binding to cGAS robustly induced the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>like droplets in which cGAS was activated. The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation by increasing the valencies of DNA binding. Long DNA was more efficient in promoting cGAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phas</span></strong>e separation and cGAS enzyme activity than short DNA. Moreover, free zinc ions enhanced cGAS enzyme activity both in vitro and in cells by promoting cGAS-DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation. These results demonstrated that the DNA-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> transition of cGAS promotes cGAMP production and innate immune signaling.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> transition between two supercooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> states, but so far this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> transition between two homogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with yeast prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical yeast prion protein Sup35. In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation followed by gelation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH sensor domain. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation promoted yeast cell survival by rescuing the essential Sup35 translation factor from stress-induced damage. Thus, prion-like domains represent conserved environmental stress sensors that facilitate rapid adaptation in unstable environments by modifying protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> behavior.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

A Novel Mechanism, Linked to Cell Density, Largely Controls Cell Division in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>Many studies have investigated the various genetic and environmental factors regulating cyanobacterial growth. Here, we investigated the growth and metabolism of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 under different nitrogen sources, light intensities, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Cells grown on urea showed the highest growth rates. However, for all conditions tested, the daily growth rates in batch cultures decreased steadily over time, and stationary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> was obtained with similar cell densities. Unexpectedly, metabolic and physiological analyses showed that growth rates during log <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> were not controlled primarily by the availability of photoassimilates. Further physiological investigations indicated that nutrient limitation, quorum sensing, light quality, and light intensity (self-shading) were not the main factors responsible for the decrease in the growth rate and the onset of the stationary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>. Moreover, cell division rates in fed-batch cultures were positively correlated with the dilution rates. Hence, not only light, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nutrients can affect growth but also a cell-cell interaction. Accordingly, we propose that cell-cell interaction may be a factor responsible for the gradual decrease of growth rates in batch cultures during log <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, culminating with the onset of stationary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>.</p>

Regulation of Vegetative Phase Change by SWI2/SNF2 Chromatin Remodeling ATPase BRAHMA
<p>Plants progress from a juvenile vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> of development to an adult vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> of development before they enter the reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>. miR156 has been shown to be the master regulator of the juvenile-to-adult transition in plants. However, the mechanism of how miR156 is transcriptionally regulated still remains elusive. In a forward genetic screen, we identified that a mutation in the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) exhibited an accelerated vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> change phenotype by reducing the expression of miR156, which in turn caused a corresponding increase in the levels of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> genes. BRM regulates miR156 expression by directly binding to the <i>MIR156A</i> promoter. Mutations in <i>BRM</i> not only increased occupancy of the −2 and +1 nucleosomes proximal to the transcription start site at the <i>MIR156A</i> locus but also the levels of trimethylated histone H3 at Lys 27. The precocious phenotype of <i>brm</i> mutant was partially suppressed by a second mutation in <i>SWINGER</i> (<i>SWN</i>), but not by a mutation in <i>CURLEY LEAF</i>, both of which are key components of the Polycomb Group Repressive Complex 2 in plants. Our results indicate that BRM and SWN act antagonistically at the nucleosome level to fine-tune the temporal expression of miR156 to regulate vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> change in Arabidopsis.</p>

Evolution of Protein Domain Repeats in Metazoa
<p>Repeats are ubiquitous elements of proteins and they play important roles for cellular function and during evolution. Repeats are, however, also notoriously difficult to capture computationally and large scale studies so far had difficulties in linking genetic causes, structural properties and evolutionary trajectories of protein repeats. Here we apply recently developed methods for repeat detection and analysis to a large dataset comprising over hundred metazoan genomes. We find that repeats in larger protein families experience generally very few insertions or deletions (indels) of repeat units but there is also a significant fraction of noteworthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>e outliers with very high indel rates. Analysis of structural data indicates that repeats with an open structure and independently folding units are more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>e and more likely to be intrinsically disordered. Such disordered repeats are also significantly enriched in sites with a high functional potential such as linear motifs. Furthermore, the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>e repeats have a high sequence similarity between their units. Since many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>e repeats also show signs of recombination, we conclude they are often shaped by concerted evolution. Intriguingly, many of these conserved yet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>e repeats are involved in host-pathogen interactions where they might foster fast but subtle adaptation in biological arms races.</p><p><bold><i>Key Words</i>:</bold> protein evolution, domain rearrangements, protein repeats, concerted evolution.</p>

Metastable ferroelectricity in optically strained SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
<p>Fluctuating orders in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s are generally considered high-temperature precursors of broken symmetry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. However, in some cases, these fluctuations persist to zero temperature and prevent the emergence of long-range order. Strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>) is a quantum paraelectric in which dipolar fluctuations grow upon cooling, although a long-range ferroelectric order never sets in. Here, we show that optical excitation of lattice vibrations can induce polar order. This metastable polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, observed up to temperatures exceeding 290 kelvin, persists for hours after the optical pump is interrupted. Furthermore, hardening of a low-frequency vibration points to a photoinduced ferroelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> transition, with a spatial domain distribution suggestive of a photoflexoelectric coupling.</p>

A molecular perovskite solid solution with piezoelectricity stronger than lead zirconate titanate

Stoichiometry controls activity of phase-separated clusters of actin signaling proteins
<p>Biomolecular condensates concentrate macromolecules into foci without a surrounding membrane. Many condensates appear to form through multivalent interactions that drive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phas</span></strong>e separation (LLPS). LLPS increases the specific activity of actin regulatory proteins toward actin assembly by the Arp2/3 complex. We show that this increase occurs because LLPS of the Nephrin–Nck–N-WASP signaling pathway on lipid bilayers increases membrane dwell time of N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex, consequently increasing actin assembly. Dwell time varies with relative stoichiometry of the signaling proteins in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>-separated clusters, rendering N-WASP and Arp2/3 activity stoichiometry dependent. This mechanism of controlling protein activity is enabled by the stoichiometrically undefined nature of biomolecular condensates. Such regulation should be a general feature of signaling systems that assemble through multivalent interactions and drive nonequilibrium outputs.</p>

Tuning superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene
<p>Materials with flat electronic bands often exhibit exotic quantum phenomena owing to strong correlations. An isolated low-energy flat band can be induced in bilayer graphene by simply rotating the layers by 1.1°, resulting in the appearance of gate-tunable superconducting and correlated insulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to the twist angle, the interlayer coupling can be varied to precisely tune these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. We induce superconductivity at a twist angle larger than 1.1°—in which correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s are otherwise absent—by varying the interlayer spacing with hydrostatic pressure. Our low-disorder devices reveal details about the superconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> diagram</span></strong> and its relationship to the nearby insulator. Our results demonstrate twisted bilayer graphene to be a distinctively tunable platform for exploring correlated states.</p>

Ultrafast disordering of vanadium dimers in photoexcited VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>Many ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> transitions are treated as chemical reactions that transform the structures between two different unit cells along a reaction coordinate, but this neglects the role of disorder. Although ultrafast diffraction provides insights into atomic dynamics during such transformations, diffraction alone probes an averaged unit cell and is less sensitive to randomness in the transition pathway. Using total scattering of femtosecond x-ray pulses, we show that atomic disordering in photoexcited vanadium dioxide (VO<sub>2</sub>) is central to the transition mechanism and that, after photoexcitation, the system explores a large volume of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> space on a time scale comparable to that of a single phonon oscillation. These results overturn the current understanding of an archetypal ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> transition and provide new microscopic insights into rapid evolution toward equilibrium in photoexcited matter.</p>

Hybrid molecular-colloidal liquid crystals

Both types of uniaxial building blocks, while freely diffusing, interact to form an orthorhombic nematic fluid, in which like-sized rods are roughly parallel to each other and the molecular ordering direction is orthogonal to that of colloidal rods.

Wrapping with a splash: High-speed encapsulation with ultrathin sheets

Thin elastic sheets can wrap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> drops in a spontaneous process driven by capillary forces.

We exploit the fast dynamics of droplet impact to achieve wrapping of oil droplets by ultrathin polymer films in a water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>. Despite the violence of splashing events, the process robustly yields wrappings that are optimally shaped to maximize the enclosed fluid volume and have near-perfect seams.

Signatures of exciton condensation in a transition metal dichalcogenide

Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to condense into either a superfluid or an insulating electronic crystal.

Near the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the electronic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of the valence electrons into an exciton condensate.

Quantized electric multipole insulators

Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. Furthermore, they host topologically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary.

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth’s deep mantle

CYP79D73 Participates in Biosynthesis of Floral Scent Compound 2-Phenylethanol in <i>Plumeria rubra</i>
<p>Plumeria (<i>Plumeria rubra</i>), well known for its brightly colored and fragrant flowers, emits a number of floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>e organic compounds (VOCs). Plumeria flowers emit a total of 43 VOCs including nine phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, such as 2-phenylethanol (2PE), benzaldehyde, 2-phenylacetaldehyde (PAld), (<i>E/Z</i>)<i>-</i>phenylacetaldoxime (PAOx), benzyl nitrile (BN), and 2-phenylnitroethane (PN). To identify genes and pathways involved in the production of the major compound 2PE, we analyzed the plumeria floral transcriptome and found a highly expressed, flower-specific gene encoding a cytochrome P450 family 79D protein (PrCYP79D73), which catalyzed the formation of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx. Feeding experiments with deuterated phenylalanine or deuterated (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx showed that (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 2PE, as are two nitrogen-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>es, BN and PN, in plumeria flowers. Crude enzyme extracts from plumeria flowers converted <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx, PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN. The biosynthesis of these compounds increased with addition of PrCYP79D73-enriched microsomes but was blocked by pretreatment with 4-phenylimidazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Moreover, overexpression of <i>PrCYP79D73</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> resulted in the emission of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx as well as PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN, all of which were also found among plumeria floral VOCs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PrCYP79D73 is a crucial player in the biosynthesis of the major floral VOC 2PE and other nitrogen-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>es. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volatil</span></strong>es may be required for plant defense as well as to attract pollinators for the successful reproduction of plumeria.</p>

Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p>Flooding is detrimental for nearly all higher plants, including crops. The compound stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light levels under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to plant death. The endogenous concentrations of four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>ous compounds, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and nitric oxide, change during the submergence of plant organs in water. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s play a pivotal role in signal transduction cascades, leading to adaptive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early flooding stress, most likely in tight interaction with the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells during flooding and directly after subsidence, during which the plant is confronted with high light and oxygen levels, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled levels of ROS are essential for adaptive signaling pathways, in interaction with the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>ous flooding signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for plants. Therefore, a fine-tuned balance is important, with a major role for ROS production and scavenging. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing flooding conditions and subsequent adaptive responses.</p>

Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control

Experimental results and computations enabled us to measure the spatial correlations and strain response of softness, as well as two measures of plasticity: the size of rearrangements and the yield strain. All four quantities maintained remarkable commonality in their values for disordered packings of objects ranging from atoms to grains, spanning seven orders of magnitude in diameter and 13 orders of magnitude in elastic modulus.

Mutations in the promoter of the telomerase gene <i>TERT</i> contribute to tumorigenesis by a two-step mechanism

Here, we show that TPMs acquired at the transition from benign nevus to malignant melanoma do not support telomere maintenance. In vitro experiments revealed that TPMs do not prevent telomere attrition, resulting in cells with critically short and unprotected telomeres. Immortalization by TPMs requires a gradual up-regulation of telomerase, coinciding with telomere fusions. These data suggest that TPMs contribute to tumorigenesis by promoting immortalization and genomic instability in two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. In an initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, TPMs do not prevent bulk telomere shortening but extend cellular life span by healing the shortest telomeres. In the second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, the critically short telomeres lead to genome instability and telomerase is further up-regulated to sustain cell proliferation.</p>

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid
<p>Charge ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which electrons in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s crystallize into a periodic pattern of charge-rich and charge-poor sites owing to strong electron correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In geometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy electronic state without long-range CO has been observed. We found that a charge-ordered organic material with an isosceles triangular lattice shows charge dynamics associated with crystallization and vitrification of electrons, which can be understood in the context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO patterns. The dynamics suggest that the same nucleation and growth processes that characterize conventional glass-forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>s guide the crystallization of electrons. These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-glass transition.</p>

Electronic crystal growth
<p>Interacting atoms or molecules condense into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>, and, when cooled further, they form a crystal. The time evolution of the atomic or molecular ordering has been widely studied as a nonequilibrium emergence of order from a supercooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> or a glass. Interacting electrons in a variety of correlated electron systems also form crystals, but observing the time evolution of electronic crystallization has been experimentally challenging. Here, working with an organic conductor exhibiting a supercooled charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> or charge glass as a metastable state, we observed electronic crystal growth through resistivity and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The temperature profile of the crystal growth is similar to those observed in classical systems and reveals two distinct regimes for the mechanism of electronic crystallization.</p>

Angular momentum–induced delays in solid-state photoemission enhanced by intra-atomic interactions
<p>Attosecond time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that photoemission from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s is not yet fully understood. The relative emission delays between four photoemission channels measured for the van der Waals crystal tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) can only be explained by accounting for both propagation and intra-atomic delays. The intra-atomic delay depends on the angular momentum of the initial localized state and is determined by intra-atomic interactions. For the studied case of WSe<sub>2</sub>, the photoemission events are time ordered with rising initial-state angular momentum. Including intra-atomic electron-electron interaction and angular momentum of the initial localized state yields excellent agreement between theory and experiment. This has required a revision of existing models for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-state photoemission, and thus, attosecond time-resolved photoemission from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s provides important benchmarks for improved future photoemission models.</p>

Soft x-ray excitonics
<p>The dynamic response of excitons in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s is central to modern condensed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> physics, material sciences, and photonic technologies. However, study and control have hitherto been limited to photon energies lower than the fundamental band gap. Here we report application of attosecond soft x-ray and attosecond optical pulses to study the dynamics of core-excitons at the L<sub>2,3</sub> edge of Si in silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>). This attosecond x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (AXANES) technique enables direct probing of the excitons’ quasiparticle character, tracking of their subfemtosecond relaxation, the measurement of excitonic polarizability, and observation of dark core-excitonic states. Direct measurement and control of core-excitons in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s lay the foundation of x-ray excitonics.</p>

Bloch oscillations in the absence of a lattice
<p>The interplay of strong quantum correlations and far-from-equilibrium conditions can give rise to striking dynamical phenomena. We experimentally investigated the quantum motion of an impurity atom immersed in a strongly interacting one-dimensional Bose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> and subject to an external force. We found that the momentum distribution of the impurity exhibits characteristic Bragg reflections at the edge of an emergent Brillouin zone. Although Bragg reflections are typically associated with lattice structures, in our strongly correlated quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> they result from the interplay of short-range crystalline order and kinematic constraints on the many-body scattering processes in the one-dimensional system. As a consequence, the impurity exhibits periodic dynamics, reminiscent of Bloch oscillations, although the quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> is translationally invariant. Our observations are supported by large-scale numerical simulations.</p>

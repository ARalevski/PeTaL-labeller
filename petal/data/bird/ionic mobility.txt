Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair. The dynamic, reversible format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multinuclear sites from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ized single atoms represents a distinct phenomenon that falls outside the convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al boundaries of a heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>).   Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA.

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolyte with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper–lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF<sub>3</sub>) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and defluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in a fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature. Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–mediated electrochemistry offers a pathway toward developing capacities beyond that of lithium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> technology.</p>

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s approaching the size of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and water molecules. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong>s of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, molecular separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

Quantum correlations from a room-temperature optomechanical cavity
<p>The act of posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> measurement alters the mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of an object being measured. This quantum measurement backact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is typically much smaller than the thermal mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a room-temperature object and thus difficult to observe. By shining laser light through a nanomechanical beam, we measure the beam’s thermally driven vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and perturb its mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with optical force fluctuat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s at a level dictated by the Heisenberg measurement-disturbance uncertainty relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We demonstrate a cross-correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> technique to distinguish optically driven mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from thermally driven mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, observing this quantum backact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> signature up to room temperature. We use the scale of the quantum correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, which is determined by fundamental constants, to gauge the size of thermal mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, demonstrating a path toward absolute thermometry with quantum mechanically calibrated ticks.</p>

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> (NHX-type) antiporters are important regulators of intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and are critical for cell expans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and plant stress acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and pH homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth phenotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar pH and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles. These results highlight the importance of NHX-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the maintenance of cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> homeostasis and in growth and development.</p>

Risk factors for wear-related failures after hip resurfacing in patients with a low contact patch to rim distance

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other monatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for proton channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

The fading American dream: Trends in absolute income mobility since 1940

We found that rates of absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity have fallen from approximately 90% for children born in 1940 to 50% for children born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity to the rates experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would reverse more than 70% of the decline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity. These results imply that reviving the “American dream” of high rates of absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity would require economic growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Elucidation of the Mechanisms of Long-Distance mRNA Movement in a <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>/Tomato Heterograft System
<p>Recent heterograft analyses showed that large-scale messenger RNA (mRNA) movement takes place in the phloem, but the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e transcripts reported varies widely. However, our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying large-scale mRNA movement remains limited. In this study, using a <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>/tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) heterograft system and a transgenic approach involving potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>), we found that: (1) the overall mRNA abundance in the leaf is not a good indicator of transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity to the root; (2) increasing the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels of non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e mRNAs in the comp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> cells does not promote their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity; (3) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e mRNAs undergo degradat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> during their movement; and (4) some mRNAs arriving in roots move back to shoots. These results indicate that mRNA movement has both regulated and unregulated components. The cellular origins of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e mRNAs may differ between herbaceous and woody species. Taken together, these findings suggest that the long-distance movement of mRNAs is a complex process and that elucidating the physiological roles associated with this movement is challenging but remains an important task for future research.</p>

Iodide management in formamidinium-lead-halide–based perovskite layers for efficient solar cells

The long-run poverty and gender impacts of mobile money
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e money, a service that allows monetary value to be stored on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e phone and sent to other users via text messages, has been adopted by the vast majority of Kenyan households. We estimate that access to the Kenyan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e money system M-PESA increased per capita consumpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels and lifted 194,000 households, or 2% of Kenyan households, out of poverty. The impacts, which are more pronounced for female-headed households, appear to be driven by changes in financial behavior—in particular, increased financial resilience and saving—and labor market outcomes, such as occupat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al choice, especially for women, who moved out of agriculture and into business. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e money has therefore increased the efficiency of the allo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> of consumpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> over time while allowing a more efficient allo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> of labor, resulting in a meaningful reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of poverty in Kenya.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Mobility of Antiflorigen and PEBP mRNAs in Tomato-Tobacco Heterografts
<p>Photoperiodic floral induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is controlled by the leaf-derived and antagonistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e signals florigen and antiflorigen. In response to photoperiodic variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, florigen and antiflorigen are produced in leaves and translocated through phloem to the apex, where they counteract floral initiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Florigen and antiflorigen are encoded by a pair of homologs belonging to <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>)- or <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>)-like clades in the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding domain protein (PEBP) family. The PEBP gene family contains <i>FT</i>-, <i>TFL1</i>-, and <i>MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1</i> (<i>MFT</i>)-like clades. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary analysis suggests that <i>FT</i>- and <i>TFL1</i>-like clades arose from an ancient <i>MFT</i>-like clade. The protein movement of the PEBP family is an evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>arily conserved mechanism in many plants; however, the mRNA movement of the PEBP family remains controversial. Here, we examined the mRNA movement of PEBP genes in different plant species. We identified a tobacco (<i>Nicotiana sylvestris</i>) <i>CENTRORADIALIS-like1</i> gene, denoted <i>NsCET1</i>, and showed that <i>NsCET1</i> is an ortholog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) antiflorigen <i>ATC</i>. In tobacco, <i>NsCET1</i> acts as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e molecule that non-cell-autonomously inhibits flowering. Grafting experiments showed that endogenous and ectopically expressed <i>NsCET1</i> mRNAs move long distances in tobacco and Arabidopsis. Heterografts of tobacco and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) showed that, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to <i>NsCET1</i>, multiple members of the <i>FT</i>-, <i>TFL1</i>-, and <i>MFT</i>-like clades of tobacco and tomato PEBP gene families are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e mRNAs. Our results suggest that the mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity is a common feature of the three clades of PEBP-like genes among different plant species.</p>

Selective Targeting of Mobile mRNAs to Plasmodesmata for Cell-to-Cell Movement
<p>Many plant mRNAs move from cell to cell or long distance to execute non-cell-autonomous funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e mRNAs traffic through the phloem to regulate many developmental processes, but despite the burgeoning discovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e mRNAs, little is known about the mechanism underlying the intracellular sorting of these mRNAs. Here, we exploited a fluorescence-based mRNA labeling system, using the bacteriophage coat protein MS2, fused to GFP (MS2-GFP) and an MS2 recognit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> site in the RNA of interest, to visualize the intracellular trafficking of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e mRNAs in living plant cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We first improved this system by using the nuclear localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> sequence from FD, which substantially reduced the fluorescent background of MS2-GFP in the cytoplasm. The modified system allowed us to observe the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci dependent on MS2-binding sites. Coexpressing the MS2-GFP system with a virus movement protein, which is a plasmodesmata (PD)-localized nonspecific RNA-binding protein, targeted cytoplasmic fluorescent foci to the PD, suggesting that the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci contain mRNA and MS2-GFP. Our ex vivo RNA imaging revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e but not non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e mRNAs were selectively targeted to PD. Real-time images of intracellular translo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> revealed that the translo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> of mRNA and organelles in the transvacuolar strands may be governed by the same mechanism. Our study suggests that PD targeting of mRNA is a selective step in determining mRNA cell-to-cell movement of mRNAs.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Rac signal adaptation controls neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of neutrophils from the bone marrow determines neutrophil blood counts and thus is medically important. Balanced neutrophil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from the bone marrow depends on the retent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-promoting chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 and the egress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-promoting chemokine CXCL2 and its receptor CXCR2. Both pathways activate the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, leaving the role of this signaling event in neutrophil retent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and egress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> ambiguous. On the assumpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that active Rac determines persistent direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al cell migrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, we generated a mathematical model to link chemokine-mediated Rac modulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to neutrophil egress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> time. Our computer simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> indicated that, in the bone marrow, where the retent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> signal predominated, egress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> time strictly depended on the time it took Rac to return to its basal activity (namely, adaptat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>). This predict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was validated in mice lacking the Rac inhibitor ArhGAP15. Neutrophils in these mice showed prolonged Rac adaptat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and cell-autonomous retent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the bone marrow. Our model thus demonstrates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the presence of two spatially defined opposing chemotactic cues strictly depends on inhibitors shaping the time course of signal adaptat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Furthermore, our findings might help to find new modes of intervent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to treat condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s characterized by excessively low or high circulating neutrophils.</p>

mTORC1 controls lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the two-pore channel TPC2
<p>Two-pore segment channel 2 (TPC2) is a ubiquitously expressed, lysosomally targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel that aids in terminating autophagy and is inhibited upon its associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). It is controversial whether TPC2 mediates lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release or selectively conducts Na<sup>+</sup> and whether the binding of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) or phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>] is required for the activity of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We show that TPC2 is required for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in response to NAADP or to mTOR inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by rapamycin. In pulmonary arterial myocytes, rapamycin and NAADP evoked global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that were blocked by deplet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. Preincubat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of cells with high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of rapamycin resulted in desensitizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and blocked NAADP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Moreover, rapamycin and NAADP did not evoke discernable Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in myocytes derived from <i>Tpcn2</i> knockout mice, which showed normal responses to other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>izing signals. In HEK293 cells stably overexpressing human TPC2, shRNA-mediated knockdown of mTOR blocked rapamycin- and NAADP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Confocal imaging of a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator fused to TPC2 demonstrated that rapamycin-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals localized to lysosomes and were in close proximity to TPC2. Therefore, inactivat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of mTOR may activate TPC2 and consequently lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</p>

Teaching an old carbocation new tricks: Intermolecular C–H insertion reactions of vinyl cations
<p>Vinyl carbo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong>s have been the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical studies over the past five decades. Despite this long history in chemistry, the utility of vinyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong>s in chemical synthesis has been limited, with most reactivity studies focusing on solvolysis react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s or intramolecular processes.

Here, we report that merging hydrogen bonding and phase-transfer catalysis provides an effective mode of activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> for nucleophiles that are insoluble in organic solvents. This catalytic manifold relies on hydrogen bonding complexat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to render nucleophiles soluble and reactive, while simultaneously inducing asymmetry in the ensuing transformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We demonstrate the concept using a chiral bis-urea catalyst to form a tridentate hydrogen bonding complex with fluoride from its cesium salt, thereby enabling highly efficient enantioselective ring opening of episulfonium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. This fluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> method is synthetically valuable considering the scarcity of alternative protocols and points the way to wider appli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> of the catalytic approach with diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong>ic nucleophiles.</p>

Phosphoric acid as a precursor to chemicals traditionally synthesized from white phosphorus
<p>White phosphorus, generated in the legacy thermal process for phosphate rock upgrading, has long been the key industrial intermediate for the synthesis of phosphorus-containing chemicals, including herbicides, flame-retardants, catalyst ligands, battery electrolytes, pharmaceuticals, and detergents. In contrast, phosphate fertilizers are made on a much larger scale from phosphoric acid, obtained by treating phosphate rock with sulfuric acid. Dehydrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of phosphoric acid using sodium chloride gives trimetaphosphate, and here we report that trichlorosilane, primarily used for the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of high-purity silicon, reduces trimetaphosphate to the previously unknown bis(trichlorosilyl)phosphide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong>. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> offers an entry point to value-added organophosphorus chemicals such as primary and secondary alkyl phosphines, and thus to organophosphinates, and can also be used to prepare phosphine gas and the hexafluorophosphate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong>, all previously available only downstream from white phosphorus.</p>

Transcription-coupled changes in nuclear mobility of mammalian cis-regulatory elements
<p>To achieve guide RNA (gRNA) multiplexing and an efficient delivery of tens of distinct gRNAs into single cells, we developed a molecular assembly strategy termed chimeric array of gRNA oligonucleotides (CARGO). We coupled CARGO with dCas9 (catalytically dead Cas9) imaging to quantitatively measure the movement of enhancers and promoters that undergo differentiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-associated activity changes in live embryonic stem cells. Whereas all examined funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al elements exhibited subdiffusive behavior, their relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity increased concurrently with transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Furthermore, acute perturbat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of RNA polymerase II activity can reverse these activity-linked increases in loci <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity. Through quantitative CARGO-dCas9 imaging, we provide direct measurements of cis-regulatory element dynamics in living cells and distinct cellular and activity states and uncover an intrinsic connect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between cis-regulatory element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity and transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Toward an optically controlled brain
<p>Neurons can be modified with light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels, which cause them to become excited upon illuminat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). This discovery has given rise to the field of optogenetics, with impressive examples such as triggering the beat of a heart with light (<i>3</i>). There is, however, one technical limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>: Light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels are typically stimulated with blue-green light, which is heavily scattered by tissue. Thus, deep brain stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, focused on small reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, is a major challenge. On page 679 of this issue, Chen <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) use transgenic mice implanted with upconverting nanoparticles (NPs) to locally activate light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels and modulate neuronal activity, even deep inside the brain. This method might eventually lead the way for clinical appli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong>s to optically control neuronal dysfunct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, such as Parkinson's disease or even paralysis.</p>

Arylation of hydrocarbons enabled by organosilicon reagents and weakly coordinating anions
<p>Over the past 80 years, phenyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> intermediates have been implicated in a variety of C–H arylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Although these examples have inspired several theoretical and mechanistic studies, aryl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> equivalents have received limited attent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in organic methodology. Their high-energy, promiscuous reactivity profiles have hampered appli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong>s in selective intermolecular processes. We report a react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> design that overcomes these challenges.

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Highly stretchable polymer semiconductor films through the nanoconfinement effect
<p>Soft and conformable wearable electronics require stretchable semiconductors, but existing ones typically sacrifice charge transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity to achieve stretchability. We explore a concept based on the nanoconfinement of polymers to substantially improve the stretchability of polymer semiconductors, without affecting charge transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity. The increased polymer chain dynamics under nanoconfinement significantly reduces the modulus of the conjugated polymer and largely delays the onset of crack format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> under strain. As a result, our fabricated semiconducting film can be stretched up to 100% strain without affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ity, retaining values comparable to that of amorphous silicon. The fully stretchable transistors exhibit high biaxial stretchability with minimal change in on current even when poked with a sharp object. We demonstrate a skinlike finger-wearable driver for a light-emitting diode.</p>

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental quest<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades.

A Functional Unfolded Protein Response Is Required for Normal Vegetative Development
<p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in plants in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and plays an important role in mitigating stress damage. Multiple factors act in the UPR, including the membrane-associated transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor, BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER 17 (bZIP17), and the membrane-associated RNA splicing factor, INOSITOL REQUIRING ENZYME1 (IRE1). We have analyzed an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>ire1a ire1b bzip17</i> triple mutant, with defects in stress signaling, and found that the mutant is also impaired in vegetative plant growth under condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s without externally applied stress. This raised the possibility that the UPR funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in plant development in the same manner as it does in responding to stress. bZIP17 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ized to the nucleus in response to stress, and through the analysis of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-defective bZIP17 mutant, we found that to support normal plant development bZIP17 must be capable of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Likewise, through the analysis of <i>ire1</i> mutants defective in either protein kinase or RNase activities, we found that both must be operative to promote normal development.

Synaptotagmin-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum-Plasma Membrane Contact Sites Are Localized to Immobile ER Tubules
<p>The plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is morphologically divided into tubules and sheets, seems to flow continuously as a whole, but locally, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e and im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exist. In eukaryotes, the ER physically and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) at domains called ER-PM contact sites (EPCSs). Extended synaptotagmin family proteins are concentrated in the cortical ER to form one type of EPCS; however, it is unclear whether the localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extended synaptotagmin corresponds to the EPCS and where in the cortical ER the EPCSs are formed. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of SYNAPTOTAGMIN1 (SYT1), a synaptotagmin in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), to investigate the precise distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of SYT1-associated EPCSs in the cortical ER. Three-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al imaging using superresolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> confocal live imaging microscopy demonstrated that SYT1 was specifically localized to the ER-PM boundary. Time-lapse imaging revealed that SYT1 was distributed to im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e ER tubules, but not to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e tubules. Moreover, SYT1 was frequently localized to the edges of ER sheets that were transformed into im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e ER tubules over time. A lower intracellular calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> resulted in an increased EPCS area and disrupted the ER network. Finally, SYT1 deficiency caused a reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e tubules and enlargement of the ER meshes. Taken together, our findings show that SYT1-associated EPCS are distributed to im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>e tubules and play an important role in the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the tubular ER network. This provides important insight into the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and dynamics/morphology of the cortical ER.</p>

Guard Cell Salicylic Acid Signaling Is Integrated into Abscisic Acid Signaling via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-Dependent Pathway

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad appli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> of this technology, including low seed oil and low proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>ized, fueling fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

Physiological studies proved that <i>SlCBL10</i> gene is required to maintain a proper low Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio in growing tissues allowing tomato growth under salt stress. Express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> analysis of the main responsible genes for Na<sup>+</sup> compartmentalizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (i.e. <i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> EXCHANGERs</i>, <i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE</i>, <i>HIGH-AFFINITY K+ TRANSPORTER 1;2</i>, <i>H<sup>+</sup>-pyrophosphatase AVP1</i> [<i>SlAVP1</i>] and V-ATPase [<i>SlVHA-A1</i>]) supported a reduced capacity to accumulate Na<sup>+</sup> in <i>Slcbl10</i> mutant leaves, which resulted in a lower uploading of Na<sup>+</sup> from xylem, allowing the toxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to reach apex and flowers. Likewise, the tomato <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> EXCHANGER 1</i> and <i>TWO-PORE CHANNEL 1</i> (<i>SlTPC1</i>), key genes for Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes to the vacuole, showed abnormal express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Slcbl10</i> plants indicating an impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from vacuole. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally, complementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> assay revealed that <i>SlCBL10</i> is a true ortholog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>CBL10</i> gene, supporting that the essential funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of CBL10 is conserved in Arabidopsis and tomato. Together, the findings obtained in this study provide new insights into the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>SlCBL10</i> in salt stress tolerance. Thus, it is proposed that SlCBL10 mediates salt tolerance by regulating Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes in the vacuole, cooperating with the vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> channel <i>SlTPC1</i> and the two vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-pumps, <i>SlAVP1</i> and <i>SlVHA-A1</i>, which in turn are revealed as potential targets of <i>SlCBL10</i>.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, with particle mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secret<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by the intestine generates luminal carbonate precipitates of divalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong>s that play a key role in water and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal inject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secret<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-inject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> either PTHrP(1–34) or immunizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> but also the concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> current induced by muscarinic stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by appli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and distinct current–voltage relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with K<sup>+</sup>-free solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Pharmacological preconditioning with erythropoietin attenuates the organ injury and dysfunction induced in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock
<p>Pre-treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) has been demonstrated to exert tissue-protective effects against ‘ischemia-reperfus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>’-type injuries. This protect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> might be mediated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are thought to secrete paracrine factors. These effects could be exploited to protect against tissue injury induced in cases where hemorrhage is foreseeable, for example, prior to major surgery. Here, we investigate the effects of EPO pre-treatment on the organ injury and dysfunct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> induced by hemorrhagic shock (HS). Recombinant human EPO (1000 IU/kg/day i.p.) was administered to rats for 3 days. Rats were subjected to HS on day 4 (pre-treatment protocol). Mean arterial pressure was reduced to 35±5 mmHg for 90 minutes, followed by resuscitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with 20 ml/kg Ringer’s lactate for 10 minutes and 50% of the shed blood for 50 minutes. Rats were sacrificed 4 hours after the onset of resuscitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. EPC (CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cell) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was measured following the 3-day pre-treatment with EPO and was significantly increased compared with rats pre-treated with phosphate-buffered saline. EPO pre-treatment significantly attenuated organ injury and dysfunct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (renal, hepatic and neuromuscular) caused by HS. In livers from rats subjected to HS, EPO enhanced the phosphorylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Akt (activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β; inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>). In the liver, HS also caused an increase in nuclear translo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></span></strong> of p65 (activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of NF-κB), which was attenuated by EPO. This data suggests that repetitive dosing with EPO prior to injury might protect against the organ injury and dysfunct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> induced by HS, by a mechanism that might involve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mobil</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cells, resulting in the activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the Akt-eNOS survival pathway and inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of GSK-3β and NF-κB.</p>

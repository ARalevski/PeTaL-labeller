Uncertainty boosts Brexit jitters for U.K. scientists
<p>U.K. scientists dreading the country's impending departure from the European Union, known as Brexit, now face possible outcomes ranging from undesirable to potentially disastrous. On 11 December, Parliament will vote on a withdrawal agreement that lays out the terms of a costly but smooth departure from the European Union, starting in March 2019. If the agreement is rejected, the United Kingdom could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crash</span></strong> out instead, triggering chaos at the border, food shortages, and economic hardship. A no-deal exit would also immediately void many research agreements. Regardless of how the United Kingdom departs, it will have to negotiate new science agreements with the European Union and come up with a new EU immigration policy. A long-awaited government white paper on immigration is expected to be published this month. Two and a half years after the divisive popular referendum that launched the Brexit process, some scientists hold out hope for a reprieve: A growing number of politicians are agitating for a second referendum that might reverse the first one.</p>

Pervasive Externalities at the Population, Consumption, and Environment Nexus
<sec><title>Sticky Responses</title><p>A textbook example of an unaccounted-for consequence (externality) of commercial or industrial activity is the production of pollutants where neither the producer nor the buyer bears the cost of using common environmental resources. <bold>Dasgupta and Ehrlich</bold> (p. 324) offer a theoretical analysis of externalities in two other areas of modern lifeâ€”human fertility and material consumption. For example, when fertility decline lags mortality decline, the consequence could be environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crash</span></strong>, the likelihood of which is greater if the environmental effects of consumption or population growth are external to the market.</p></sec>

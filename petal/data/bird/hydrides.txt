Cobalt-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of enamides enabled by single-electron reduction
<p>Identifying catalyst activation modes that exploit one-electron chemistry and overcome associated deactivation pathways will be transformative for developing first-row transition metal catalysts with performance equal or, ideally, superior to precious metals. Here we describe a zinc-activation method compatible with high-throughput reaction discovery that identified scores of cobalt-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphin</span></strong>e combinations for the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes. An optimized catalyst prepared from (<i>R</i>,<i>R</i>)-Ph-BPE {Ph-BPE, 1,2-bis[(2<i>R</i>,5<i>R</i>)-2,5-diphenylphospholano]ethane} and cobalt chloride [CoCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O] exhibited high activity and enantioselectivity in protic media and enabled the asymmetric synthesis of the epilepsy medication levetiracetam at 200-gram scale with 0.08 mole % catalyst loading. Stoichiometric studies established that the cobalt (II) catalyst precursor (<i>R</i>,<i>R</i>)-Ph-BPECoCl<sub>2</sub> underwent ligand displacement by methanol, and zinc promoted facile one-electron reduction to cobalt (I), which more stably bound the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphin</span></strong>e.</p>

Phosphoric acid as a precursor to chemicals traditionally synthesized from white phosphorus
<p>White phosphorus, generated in the legacy thermal process for phosphate rock upgrading, has long been the key industrial intermediate for the synthesis of phosphorus-containing chemicals, including herbicides, flame-retardants, catalyst ligands, battery electrolytes, pharmaceuticals, and detergents. In contrast, phosphate fertilizers are made on a much larger scale from phosphoric acid, obtained by treating phosphate rock with sulfuric acid. Dehydration of phosphoric acid using sodium chloride gives trimetaphosphate, and here we report that trichloro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silan</span></strong>e, primarily used for the production of high-purity silicon, reduces trimetaphosphate to the previously unknown bis(trichlorosilyl)phosphide anion. This anion offers an entry point to value-added organophosphorus chemicals such as primary and secondary alkyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphin</span></strong>es, and thus to organo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphin</span></strong>ates, and can also be used to prepare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphin</span></strong>e gas and the hexafluorophosphate anion, all previously available only downstream from white phosphorus.</p>

Photocatalytic decarboxylative alkylations mediated by triphenylphosphine and sodium iodide
<p>Most photoredox catalysts in current use are precious metal complexes or synthetically elaborate organic dyes, the cost of which can impede their application for large-scale industrial processes. We found that a combination of triphenyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphin</span></strong>e and sodium iodide under 456-nanometer irradiation by blue light–emitting diodes can catalyze the alkylation of silyl enol ethers by decarboxylative coupling with redox-active esters in the absence of transition metals. Deaminative alkylation using Katritzky’s N-alkylpyridinium salts and trifluoromethylation using Togni’s reagent are also demonstrated. Moreover, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphin</span></strong>e/iodide-based photoredox system catalyzes Minisci-type alkylation of N-heterocycles and can operate in tandem with chiral phosphoric acids to achieve high enantioselectivity in this reaction.</p>

Enantiodivergent Pd-catalyzed C–C bond formation enabled through ligand parameterization
<p>Despite the enormous potential for the use of stereospecific cross-coupling reactions to rationally manipulate the three-dimensional structure of organic molecules, the factors that control the transfer of stereochemistry in these reactions remain poorly understood. Here we report a mechanistic and synthetic investigation into the use of enantioenriched alkylboron nucleophiles in stereospecific Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. By developing a suite of molecular descriptors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphin</span></strong>e ligands, we could apply predictive statistical models to select or design distinct ligands that respectively promoted stereoinvertive and stereoretentive cross-coupling reactions. Stereodefined branched structures were thereby accessed through the predictable manipulation of absolute stereochemistry, and a general model for the mechanism of alkylboron transmetallation was proposed.</p>

Coordination-induced weakening of ammonia, water, and hydrazine X–H bonds in a molybdenum complex
<p>Although scores of transition metal complexes incorporating ammonia or water ligands have been characterized over the past century, little is known about how coordination influences the strength of the nitrogen-hydrogen and oxygen-hydrogen bonds. Here we report the synthesis of a molybdenum ammonia complex supported by terpyridine and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphin</span></strong>e ligands that lowers the nitrogen-hydrogen bond dissociation free energy from 99.5 (gas phase) to an experimentally measured value of 45.8 kilocalories per mole (agreeing closely with a value of 45.1 kilocalories per mole calculated by density functional theory). This bond weakening enables spontaneous dihydrogen evolution upon gentle heating, as well as the hydrogenation of styrene. Analogous molybdenum complexes promote dihydrogen evolution from coordinated water and hydrazine. Electrochemical and theoretical studies elucidate the contributions of metal redox potential and ammonia acidity to this effect.</p>

A 28-year clinical and radiological follow-up of alumina ceramic-on-crosslinked polyethylene total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim in this study was to describe a continuing review of   11 total hip arthroplasties using 22.225 mm Alumina ceramic femoral   heads on a Charnley flanged femoral component, articulating against   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silan</span></strong>e crosslinked polyethylene.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Nine patients (11 THAs) were reviewed at a mean of 27.5 years   (26 to 28) post-operatively. Outcome was assessed using the d’Aubigne   and Postel, and Charnley scores and penetration was recorded on   radiographs. In addition, the oxidation of a 29-year-old shelf-aged   acetabular component was analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean clinical outcome scores remained excellent at final   follow-up. The mean total penetration remained 0.41 mm (0.40 to   0.41). There was no radiographic evidence of acetabular or femoral   loosening or osteolysis. There was negligible oxidation in the shelf-aged   sample despite gamma irradiation and storage in air.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results highlight the long-term stability and durability   of this type of crosslinked, antioxidant containing polyethylene   when used in combination with a small diameter alumina ceramic femoral   head.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1286–9.</p></sec>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral gap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were identified as novel mRNA targets of FXR1 by using a BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and stabilization of its mRNA targets in heart muscle. In addition, introduction of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of gap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in disease progression by regulating gap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> remodeling. Together this study provides a novel function of FXR1, namely, that it directly regulates major gap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> components, contributing to proper cell-cell communication in the heart.</p></sec>

Characterizing mutagenic effects of recombination through a sequence-level genetic map
<p>Genetic diversity arises from recombination and de novo mutation (DNM). Using a combination of microarray genotype and whole-genome sequence data on parent-child pairs, we identified 4,531,535 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>over recombinations and 200,435 DNMs. The resulting genetic map has a resolution of 682 base pairs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs exhibit a mutagenic effect, with overrepresentation of DNMs within 1 kilobase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs in males and females. In females, a higher mutation rate is observed up to 40 kilobases from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs, particularly for complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs, which increase with maternal age. We identified 35 loci associated with the recombination rate or the location of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs, demonstrating extensive genetic control of meiotic recombination, and our results highlight genes linked to the formation of the synaptonemal complex as determinants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs.</p>

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons transmitted a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> a ballistic semiconductor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> are expected to undergo refraction, analogous to light rays a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> an optical boundary. In graphene, the linear dispersion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the propagation of carriers a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> an electrostatically defined graphene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>.

Resonant transmission a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> the p-n <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent transmission coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> width, providing guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for realizing electron optics based on graphene p-n <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s.</p>

An atrial-fibrillation-linked connexin40 mutant is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and impairs the function of atrial gap-junction channels
<p>Connexin40 (Cx40)-containing gap-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> channels are expressed in the atrial myocardium and provide a low-resistance passage for rapid impulse propagation. A germline mutation in the <i>GJA5</i> gene, which encodes Cx40, resulting in a truncated Cx40 (Q49X) was identified in a large Chinese family with lone (idiopathic) atrial fibrillation (AF). This mutation co-segregated with seven AF probands in an autosomal-dominant way over generations. To test the hypothesis that this Cx40 mutant affects the distribution and function of atrial gap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s, we studied the Q49X mutant in gap-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>-deficient HeLa and N2A cells. The Q49X mutant, unlike wild-type Cx40, was typically localized in the cytoplasm and failed to form gap-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> plaques at cell-cell interfaces. When the Q49X mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43, the mutant substantially reduced the gap-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> plaque formation of Cx40 and Cx43. Electrophysiological studies revealed no electrical coupling of cell pairs expressing the mutant alone and a significant decrease in the coupling conductance when the mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43. Further colocalization experiments with the organelle residential proteins indicate that Q49X was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings provide evidence that the Q49X mutant is capable of impairing gap-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> distribution and function of key atrial connexins, which might play a role in the predisposition to and onset of AF.</p>

Late-phase synthesis of IκBα insulates the TLR4-activated canonical NF-κB pathway from noncanonical NF-κB signaling in macrophages
<p>The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors coordinate the inflammatory immune response during microbial infection. Pathogenic substances engage canonical NF-κB signaling through the heterodimer RelA:p50, which is subjected to rapid negative feedback by inhibitor of κBα (IκBα). The noncanonical NF-κB pathway is required for the differentiation of immune cells; however, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-talk between both pathways can occur. Concomitantly activated noncanonical signaling generates p52 from the p100 precursor. The synthesis of p100 is induced by canonical signaling, leading to the formation of the late-acting RelA:p52 heterodimer. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-talk prolongs inflammatory RelA activity in epithelial cells to ensure pathogen clearance. We found that the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–activated canonical NF-κB signaling pathway is insulated from lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR)–induced noncanonical signaling in mouse macrophage cell lines. Combined computational and biochemical studies indicated that the extent of NF-κB–responsive expression of <i>Nfkbia</i>, which encodes IκBα, inversely correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-talk. The <i>Nfkbia</i> promoter showed enhanced responsiveness to NF-κB activation in macrophages compared to that in fibroblasts. We found that this hyperresponsive promoter engaged the RelA:p52 dimer generated during costimulation of macrophages through TLR4 and LTβR to trigger synthesis of IκBα at late time points, which prevented the late-acting RelA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-talk response. Together, these data suggest that, despite the presence of identical signaling networks in cells of diverse lineages, emergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-talk between signaling pathways is subject to cell type–specific regulation. We propose that the insulation of canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways limits the deleterious effects of macrophage-mediated inflammation.</p>

Factors influencing meiotic recombination revealed by whole-genome sequencing of single sperm
<p>Recombination is critical to meiosis and evolution, yet many aspects of the physical exchange of DNA via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs remain poorly understood. We report an approach for single-cell whole-genome DNA sequencing by which we sequenced 217 individual hybrid mouse sperm, providing a kilobase-resolution genome-wide map of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs. Combining this map with molecular assays measuring stages of recombination, we identified factors that affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>over probability, including PRDM9 binding on the non-initiating template homolog and telomere proximity. These factors also influence the time for sites of recombination-initiating DNA double-strand breaks to find and engage their homologs, with rapidly engaging sites more likely to form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs. We show that chromatin environment on the template homolog affects positioning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>over breakpoints. Our results also offer insights into recombination in the pseudoautosomal region.</p>

WDFY4 is required for cross-presentation in response to viral and tumor antigens
<p>During the process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-presentation, viral or tumor-derived antigens are presented to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by <i>Batf3-</i>dependent CD8α<sup>+</sup>/XCR1<sup>+</sup> classical dendritic cells (cDC1s). We designed a functional CRISPR screen for previously unknown regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-presentation, and identified the BEACH domain–containing protein WDFY4 as essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-presentation of cell-associated antigens by cDC1s in mice.

In contrast to <i>Batf3</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice, <i>Wdfy4</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice displayed normal lymphoid and nonlymphoid cDC1 populations that produce interleukin-12 and protect against <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> infection.

Holliday junction resolvases mediate chloroplast nucleoid segregation
<p>Holliday <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s, four-stranded DNA structures formed during homologous recombination, are disentangled by resolvases that have been found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes but not in plant organelles. Here, we identify monokaryotic chloroplast 1 (MOC1) as a Holliday <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> resolvase in chloroplasts by analyzing a green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> mutant defective in chloroplast nucleoid (DNA-protein complex) segregation. <i>MOC1</i> is structurally similar to a bacterial Holliday <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> resolvase, resistance to ultraviolet (Ruv) C, and genetically conserved among green plants. Reduced or no expression of <i>MOC1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> leads to growth defects and aberrant chloroplast nucleoid segregation. In vitro biochemical analysis and high-speed atomic force microscopic analysis revealed that <i>A. thaliana</i> MOC 1 (AtMOC1) binds and cleaves the core of Holliday <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s symmetrically. MOC1 may mediate chloroplast nucleoid segregation in green plants by resolving Holliday <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s.</p>

Proximity biotinylation identifies a set of conformation-specific interactions between Merlin and cell junction proteins
<p>Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited, neoplastic disease associated with schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas and that is caused by inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene <i>NF2</i>. The <i>NF2</i> gene product, Merlin, has no intrinsic catalytic activity; its tumor suppressor function is mediated through the proteins with which it interacts. We used proximity biotinylation followed by mass spectrometry and direct binding assays to identify proteins that associated with wild-type and various mutant forms of Merlin in immortalized Schwann cells. We defined a set of 52 proteins in close proximity to wild-type Merlin. Most of the Merlin-proximal proteins were components of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>al signaling complexes, suggesting that additional potential interaction partners may exist in adherens <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s, tight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s, and focal adhesions. With mutant forms of Merlin that cannot bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) or that constitutively adopt a closed conformation, we confirmed a critical role for PIP<sub>2</sub> binding in Merlin function and identified a large cohort of proteins that specifically interacted with Merlin in the closed conformation. Among these proteins, we identified a previously unreported Merlin-binding protein, apoptosis-stimulated p53 protein 2 (ASPP2, also called Tp53bp2), that bound to closed-conformation Merlin predominately through the FERM domain. Our results demonstrate that Merlin is a component of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>al mechanosensing complexes and defines a specific set of proteins through which it acts.</p>

PDZRN3 destabilizes endothelial cell-cell junctions through a PKCζ-containing polarity complex to increase vascular permeability
<p>Endothelial cells serve as a barrier between blood and tissues. Maintenance of the endothelial cell barrier depends on the integrity of intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s, which is regulated by a polarity complex that includes the ζ isoform of atypical protein kinase C (PKCζ) and partitioning defective 3 (PAR3). We revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase PDZ domain–containing ring finger 3 (PDZRN3) regulated endothelial intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> integrity. Endothelial cell–specific overexpression of <i>Pdzrn3</i> led to early embryonic lethality with severe hemorrhaging and altered organization of endothelial intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s. Conversely, endothelial-specific loss of <i>Pdzrn3</i> prevented vascular leakage in a mouse model of transient ischemic stroke, an effect that was mimicked by pharmacological inhibition of PKCζ. PDZRN3 regulated Wnt signaling and associated with a complex containing PAR3, PKCζ, and the multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1 (Discs Lost–multi-PDZ domain protein 1) and targeted MUPP1 for proteasomal degradation in transfected cells. Transient ischemic stroke increased the ubiquitination of MUPP1, and deficiency of MUPP1 in endothelial cells was associated with decreased localization of PKCζ and PAR3 at intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s. In endothelial cells, <i>Pdzrn3</i> overexpression increased permeability through a PKCζ-dependent pathway. In contrast, <i>Pdzrn3</i> depletion enhanced PKCζ accumulation at cell-cell contacts and reinforced the cortical actin cytoskeleton under stress conditions. These findings reveal how PDZRN3 regulates vascular permeability through a PKCζ-containing complex.</p>

Lacteal junction zippering protects against diet-induced obesity
<p>Excess dietary lipid uptake causes obesity, a major global health problem. Enterocyte-absorbed lipids are packaged into chylomicrons, which enter the bloodstream through intestinal lymphatic vessels called lacteals. Here, we show that preventing lacteal chylomicron uptake by inducible endothelial genetic deletion of <i>Neuropilin1</i> (<i>Nrp1</i>) and <i>Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1</i> (<i>Vegfr1</i>; also known as <i>Flt1</i>) renders mice resistant to diet-induced obesity. Absence of NRP1 and FLT1 receptors increased VEGF-A bioavailability and signaling through VEGFR2, inducing lacteal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> zippering and chylomicron malabsorption. Restoring permeable lacteal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s by VEGFR2 and vascular endothelial (VE)–cadherin signaling inhibition rescued chylomicron transport in the mutant mice. Zippering of lacteal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s by disassembly of cytoskeletal VE-cadherin anchors prevented chylomicron uptake in wild-type mice. These data suggest that lacteal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s may be targets for preventing dietary fat uptake.</p>

Toughening elastomers using mussel-inspired iron-catechol complexes
<p>Materials often exhibit a trade-off between stiffness and extensibility; for example, strengthening elastomers by increasing their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-link density leads to embrittlement and decreased toughness. Inspired by cuticles of marine mussel byssi, we circumvent this inherent trade-off by incorporating sacrificial, reversible iron-catechol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-links into a dry, loosely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-linked epoxy network. The iron-containing network exhibits two to three orders of magnitude increases in stiffness, tensile strength, and tensile toughness compared to its iron-free precursor while gaining recoverable hysteretic energy dissipation and maintaining its original extensibility. Compared to previous realizations of this chemistry in hydrogels, the dry nature of the network enables larger property enhancement owing to the cooperative effects of both the increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-link density given by the reversible iron-catecholate complexes and the chain-restricting ionomeric nanodomains that they form.</p>

Control of meiotic pairing and recombination by chromosomally tethered 26<i>S</i> proteasome
<p>During meiosis, paired homologous chromosomes (homologs) become linked via the synaptonemal complex (SC) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs mediate homolog segregation and arise from self-inflicted double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we identified a role for the proteasome, the multisubunit protease that degrades proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm, in homolog juxtaposition and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>ing over. Without proteasome function, homologs failed to pair and instead remained associated with nonhomologous chromosomes. Although dispensable for non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>over formation, a functional proteasome was required for a coordinated transition that entails SC assembly between longitudinally organized chromosome axes and stable strand exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>over-designated DSBs. Notably, proteolytic core and regulatory proteasome particles were recruited to chromosomes by Zip3, the ortholog of mammalian E3 ligase RNF212, and SC protein Zip1 . We conclude that proteasome functions along meiotic chromosomes are evolutionarily conserved.</p>

Identification of ASYNAPTIC4, a Component of the Meiotic Chromosome Axis
<p>During the leptotene stage of prophase I of meiosis, chromatids become organized into a linear looped array via a protein axis that forms along the loop bases. Establishment of the axis is essential for the subsequent synapsis of the homologous chromosome pairs and the progression of recombination to form genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs. Here, we describe ASYNAPTIC4 (ASY4), a meiotic axis protein in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). ASY4 is a small coiled-coil protein that exhibits limited sequence similarity with the carboxyl-terminal region of the axis protein ASY3. We used enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged ASY4 to show that ASY4 localizes to the chromosome axis throughout prophase I. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that ASY4 interacts with ASY1 and ASY3, and yeast two-hybrid analysis confirmed a direct interaction between ASY4 and ASY3. Mutants lacking full-length ASY4 exhibited defective axis formation and were unable to complete synapsis. Although the initiation of recombination appeared to be unaffected in the <i>asy4</i> mutant, the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs was reduced significantly, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>overs tended to group in the distal parts of the chromosomes. We conclude that ASY4 is required for normal axis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>over formation. Furthermore, our data suggest that ASY3/ASY4 are the functional homologs of the mammalian SYCP2/SYCP3 axial components.</p>

The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   rotation, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program.

CD45 exclusion– and cross-linking–based receptor signaling together broaden FcεRI reactivity
<p>For many years, the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) FcεRI, which is expressed by mast cells and basophils, has been widely held to be the exemplar of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-linking (that is, aggregation dependent) signaling receptors. We found, however, that FcεRI signaling could occur in the presence or absence of receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-linking. Using both cell and cell-free systems, we showed that FcεRI signaling was stimulated by surface-associated monovalent ligands through the passive, size-dependent exclusion of the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase CD45 from plasma membrane regions of FcεRI-ligand engagement. Similarly to the T cell receptor, FcεRI signaling could also be initiated in a ligand-independent manner. These data suggest that a simple mechanism of CD45 exclusion–based receptor triggering could function together with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-linking–based FcεRI signaling, b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>ening mast cell and basophil reactivity by enabling these cells to respond to both multivalent and surface-presented monovalent antigens. These findings also strengthen the case that a size-dependent, phosphatase exclusion–based receptor triggering mechanism might serve generally to facilitate signaling by noncatalytic immune receptors.</p>

Thrombospondin-1 promotes matrix homeostasis by interacting with collagen and lysyl oxidase precursors and collagen cross-linking sites
<p>Fibrillar collagens of the extracellular matrix are critical for tissue structure and physiology; however, excessive or abnormal deposition of collagens is a defining feature of fibrosis. Regulatory mechanisms that act on collagen fibril assembly potentially offer new targets for antifibrotic treatments. Tissue weakening, altered collagen fibril morphologies, or both, are shared phenotypes of mice lacking matricellular thrombospondins. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) plays an indirect role in collagen homeostasis through interactions with matrix metalloproteinases and transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1). We found that TSP1 also affects collagen fibril formation directly. Compared to skin from wild-type mice, skin from <i>Thbs1</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice had reduced collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-linking and reduced prolysyl oxidase (proLOX) abundance with increased conversion to catalytically active LOX. In vitro, TSP1 bound to both the C-propeptide domain of collagen I and the highly conserved KGHR sequences of the collagen triple-helical domain that participate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-linking. TSP1 also bound to proLOX and inhibited proLOX processing by bone morphogenetic protein-1. In human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), TSP1 and collagen I colocalized in intracellular vesicles and on extracellular collagen fibrils, whereas TSP1 and proLOX colocalized only in intracellular vesicles. Inhibition of LOX-mediated collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-linking did not prevent the extracellular association between collagen and TSP1; however, treatment of HDFs with KGHR-containing, TSP1-binding, triple-helical peptides disrupted the collagen-TSP1 association, perturbed the collagen extracellular matrix, and increased myofibroblastic differentiation in a manner that depended on TGF-β receptor 1. Thus, the extracellular KGHR-dependent interaction of TSP1 with fibrillar collagens contributes to fibroblast homeostasis.</p>

We found that this limited abundance of γ<sub>c</sub> reduced interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-21 responses after IL-7 preexposure but not vice versa. Computational modeling combined with quantitative experimental assays indicated that the asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-talk resulted from the ability of the “private” IL-7 receptor subunits (IL-7Rα) to bind to many of the γ<sub>c</sub> molecules even before stimulation with cytokine. Upon exposure of T cells to IL-7, the high affinity of the IL-7Rα:IL-7 complex for γ<sub>c</sub> further reduced the amount of free γ<sub>c</sub> in a manner dependent on the concentration of IL-7. Measurements of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between IL-4Rα and γ<sub>c</sub> were reduced when IL-7Rα was overexpressed. Furthermore, in a system expressing IL-7Rα, IL-4Rα, and γ<sub>c</sub>, BRET between IL-4Rα and γ<sub>c</sub> increased after IL-4 binding and decreased when cells were preexposed to IL-7, supporting the assumption that IL-7Rα and the IL-7Rα:IL-7 complex limit the accessibility of γ<sub>c</sub> for other cytokine receptor complexes. We propose that in complex inflammatory environments, such asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-talk establishes a hierarchy of cytokine responsiveness.</p>

Pharmaceutical diversification via palladium oxidative addition complexes
<p>Palladium-catalyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-coupling reactions have transformed the exploration of chemical space in the search for materials, medicines, chemical probes, and other functional molecules. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-coupling of densely functionalized substrates remains a major challenge. We devised an alternative approach using stoichiometric quantities of palladium oxidative addition complexes (OACs) derived from drugs or drug-like aryl halides as substrates. In most cases, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-coupling reactions using OACs proceed under milder conditions and with higher success than the analogous catalytic reactions. OACs exhibit remarkable stability, maintaining their reactivity after months of benchtop storage under ambient conditions. We demonstrated the utility of OACs in a variety of experiments including automated nanomole-scale couplings between an OAC derived from rivaroxaban and hundreds of diverse nucleophiles, as well as the late-stage derivatization of the natural product k252a.</p>

Enantiodivergent Pd-catalyzed C–C bond formation enabled through ligand parameterization
<p>Despite the enormous potential for the use of stereospecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-coupling reactions to rationally manipulate the three-dimensional structure of organic molecules, the factors that control the transfer of stereochemistry in these reactions remain poorly understood. Here we report a mechanistic and synthetic investigation into the use of enantioenriched alkylboron nucleophiles in stereospecific Pd-catalyzed Suzuki <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-coupling reactions. By developing a suite of molecular descriptors of phosphine ligands, we could apply predictive statistical models to select or design distinct ligands that respectively promoted stereoinvertive and stereoretentive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-coupling reactions. Stereodefined branched structures were thereby accessed through the predictable manipulation of absolute stereochemistry, and a general model for the mechanism of alkylboron transmetallation was proposed.</p>

Autonomous vehicles: No driver…no regulation?

<i>C1orf106</i> is a colitis risk gene that regulates stability of epithelial adherens junctions
<p>Polymorphisms in <i>C1orf106</i> are associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the function of C1orf106 and the consequences of disease-associated polymorphisms are unknown. Here we demonstrate that C1orf106 regulates adherens <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong> stability by regulating the degradation of cytohesin-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that controls activation of ARF6. By limiting cytohesin-1–dependent ARF6 activation, C1orf106 stabilizes adherens <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s. Consistent with this model, <i>C1orf106</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice exhibit defects in the intestinal epithelial cell barrier, a phenotype observed in IBD patients that confers increased susceptibility to intestinal pathogens. Furthermore, the IBD risk variant increases C1orf106 ubiquitination and turnover with consequent functional impairments. These findings delineate a mechanism by which a genetic polymorphism fine-tunes intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and elucidate a fundamental mechanism of cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>al control.</p>

Quantized thermal transport in single-atom junctions
<p>Thermal transport in individual atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s and chains is of great fundamental interest because of the distinctive quantum effects expected to arise in them. By using novel, custom-fabricated, picowatt-resolution calorimetric scanning probes, we measured the thermal conductance of gold and platinum metallic wires down to single-atom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s. Our work reveals that the thermal conductance of gold single-atom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s is quantized at room temperature and shows that the Wiedemann-Franz law relating thermal and electrical conductance is satisfied even in single-atom contacts. Furthermore, we quantitatively explain our experimental results within the Landauer framework for quantum thermal transport. The experimental techniques reported here will enable thermal transport studies in atomic and molecular chains, which will be key to investigating numerous fundamental issues that thus far have remained experimentally inaccessible.</p>

The cytotoxic <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> PSMα3 reveals a cross-α amyloid-like fibril
<p>Amyloids are ordered protein aggregates, found in all kingdoms of life, and are involved in aggregation diseases as well as in physiological activities. In microbes, functional amyloids are often key virulence determinants, yet the structural basis for their activity remains elusive. We determined the fibril structure and function of the highly toxic, 22-residue phenol-soluble modulin α3 (PSMα3) peptide secreted by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. PSMα3 formed elongated fibrils that shared the morphological and tinctorial characteristics of canonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-β eukaryotic amyloids. However, the crystal structure of full-length PSMα3, solved de novo at 1.45 angstrom resolution, revealed a distinctive “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-α” amyloid-like architecture, in which amphipathic α helices stacked perpendicular to the fibril axis into tight self-associating sheets.

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition

After <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>ing the critical point, the condensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Regulation of Strigolactone Biosynthesis by Gibberellin Signaling
<p>Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of plant hormones that regulate diverse physiological processes, including shoot branching and root development. They also act as rhizosphere signaling molecules to stimulate the germination of root parasitic weeds and the branching of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Although various types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> talk between SLs and other hormones have been reported in physiological analyses, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> talk between gibberellin (GA) and SLs is poorly understood. We screened for chemicals that regulate the level of SLs in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and identified GA as, to our knowledge, a novel SL-regulating molecule. The regulation of SL biosynthesis by GA is dependent on the GA receptor GID1 and F-box protein GID2. GA treatment also reduced the infection of rice plants by the parasitic plant witchers weed (<i>Striga hermonthica</i>). These data not only demonstrate, to our knowledge, the novel plant hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> talk between SL and GA, but also suggest that GA can be used to control parasitic weed infections.</p>

Cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness is associated with diapause, but not the non-diapause developmental pathway, in the blow fly <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Predicting insect responses to global climate change involves understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-generation effects of temperature. The majority of temperate insects overwinter in a state of diapause, a pre-emptive response to winter conditions associated with increased cold hardiness. Diapause is often induced following maternal adult detection of an environmental cue signifying the onset of winter, whilst diapause is initiated in a subsequent life stage and/or generation. Continued global warming will expose adults to higher late-autumn temperatures, whilst diapause life stages will still experience prolonged winter cold. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-generation effect of temperature was investigated by acclimating adult <i>Calliphora vicina</i> to present-day (15°C) and future (20°C) late-autumn conditions and assessing cold-hardiness in diapause (D15 and D20) and non-diapause (ND15 and ND20) progeny. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-generation plasticity in cold hardiness was associated with D but not ND larvae. D15 larvae exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress internal freezing (supercooling point=−18.9±0.9°C) compared with D20 (−15.3±0.8°C), and displayed a greater tolerance of prolonged exposure to −4°C (LT<sub>50</sub>=26.0±1.0 and 11.4±1.1 days, respectively) and −8°C (5.1±1.1 and 3.0±1.1 days, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduced glucose content in D15 (2.4±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) compared with D20 (3.0±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) larvae. In conclusion, <i>C. vicina</i> adults exposed to warmer autumn conditions during diapause induction will produce larvae with a reduced cold hardiness capacity, which could negatively impact winter survival. Given that maternal regulation of diapause is common among temperate insects, this could be a widespread phenomenon.</p>

Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>
<p>The structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale have been well studied in animals with rigid skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in animals with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of mechanically important morphological features of the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> over an ontogenetic size range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that <i>L. terrestris</i> becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with size means that, when normalized for mass, adult worms gain ~117% mechanical advantage during radial expansion, compared with hatchling worms. We also found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-sectional area of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 power a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 power predicted by isometry. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-sectional area of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 power a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-sectional area and mechanical advantage, we calculate that the force output generated during both circular and longitudinal muscle contraction scales near isometry. We hypothesize that the allometric scaling of earthworms may reflect changes in soil properties and burrowing mechanics with size.</p>

Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by increasing bone mass under increased mechanical loads. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical bone response to applied load decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous bone, the tissue most impacted by age-related bone loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> tibial loading model to characterize the load-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-bone responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied load on tibial morphology and stiffness were determined using microcomputed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> bone strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied loading. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied load produced larger midshaft cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous bone volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the loaded tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. Load-induced tibial stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following loading, which corresponded to increased <i>in vivo</i> tibial stiffness. Stiffness in the loaded tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-sectional geometry, suggesting load-induced changes in bone material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-bone functional stiffness.</p>

Percutaneous Therapies for Peripheral Artery Disease
<p>Percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery disease continue to evolve with new techniques and devices. Although guidelines-recommended therapies have impacted cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, endovascular interventions have been shown to reduce limb pain, improve quality of life, and prolong walking distance for those with claudication and to reduce amputation rates among those with critical limb ischemia. Novel devices such as drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons have improved patency for moderate-length lesions, whereas others allow treatment of heavily calcified and tortuous segments. New adjunctive devices to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> lesions and reduce or modify associated plaque have also been developed, although level 1 data regarding their efficacy are sparse. There has also been a better mechanistic understanding of lower extremity endovascular treatment using tools such as intravascular ultrasound. This information has highlighted the need for better stent size selection for the femoropopliteal arterial segments and larger balloon diameters for the tibial arteries. Moreover, a wound perfusion approach with direct in-line flow, the so-called angiosome approach, and reconstruction of the pedal loop have been advocated for improved wound healing. Technical advances such as the tibiopedal access and reentry methods have allowed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>ing of lesions that were considered no option for the endovascular approach in the past. Collectively, there has been increased awareness, interest, and commitment by various specialty societies and organizations to advance the treatment of peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia. This is also evident by the recent coalition of 7 professional societies and organizations that represented >150 000 allied health professionals and millions of patients with peripheral artery disease at the 2015 Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Analysis Committee meeting. The percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery disease continue to evolve with longer follow-up with randomized data and larger prospective registries. In the future, it is hopeful that we will treat the lower extremity arteries according to segments, taking into account plaque morphology, luminal versus subintimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>ing, location, and stenotic versus occlusive disease. Until then, we must identify the most cost-effective, efficacious, and safe treatment for each patient. The goal of this article is to aid the practicing vascular specialist consider the optimal choices for the management of patients with vascular disease.</p>

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor ductility owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency.

Citywide effects of high-occupancy vehicle restrictions: Evidence from “three-in-one” in Jakarta

We studied Jakarta’s “three-in-one” policy, which required all private cars on two major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>s to carry at least three passengers during peak hours. After the policy was abruptly abandoned in April 2016, delays rose from 2.1 to 3.1 minutes per kilometer (min/km) in the morning peak and from 2.8 to 5.3 min/km in the evening peak. The lifting of the policy led to worse traffic throughout the city, even on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>s that had never been restricted or at times when restrictions had never been in place. In short, we find that HOV policies can greatly improve traffic conditions.</p>

Radical-polar crossover reactions of vinylboron ate complexes

The valuable boronic ester moiety remains in the product and can be used in follow-up chemistry, enlarging the chemical space of the method. The cascade uses commercial starting materials and provides access to perfluoroalkylated alcohols, γ-lactones, γ-hydroxy alkylnitriles, and compounds bearing quaternary carbon centers.</p>

We found that the SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier)–modification and ubiquitin-proteasome systems regulate the major events of meiotic prophase in mouse. Interdependent localization of SUMO, ubiquitin, and proteasomes along chromosome axes was mediated largely by RNF212 and HEI10, two E3 ligases that are also essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>over recombination. RNF212-dependent SUMO conjugation effected a checkpointlike process that stalls recombination by rendering the turnover of a subset of recombination factors dependent on HEI10-mediated ubiquitylation. We propose that SUMO conjugation establishes a precondition for designating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>over sites via selective protein stabilization. Thus, meiotic chromosome axes are hubs for regulated proteolysis via SUMO-dependent control of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.</p>

Braiding a molecular knot with eight crossings
<p>Knots may ultimately prove just as versatile and useful at the nanoscale as at the macroscale. However, the lack of synthetic routes to all but the simplest molecular knots currently prevents systematic investigation of the influence of knotting at the molecular level. We found that it is possible to assemble four building blocks into three braided ligand strands. Octahedral iron(II) ions control the relative positions of the three strands at each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>ing point in a circular triple helicate, while structural constraints on the ligands determine the braiding connections. This approach enables two-step assembly of a molecular 8<sub>19</sub> knot featuring eight nonalternating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>ings in a 192-atom closed loop ~20 nanometers in length. The resolved metal-free 8<sub>19</sub> knot enantiomers have pronounced features in their circular dichroism spectra resulting solely from topological chirality.</p>

A global map of roadless areas and their conservation status
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>s fragment landscapes and trigger human colonization and degradation of ecosystems, to the detriment of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. The planet’s remaining large and ecologically important tracts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>less areas sustain key refugia for biodiversity and provide globally relevant ecosystem services. Applying a 1-kilometer buffer to all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>s, we present a global map of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>less areas and an assessment of their status, quality, and extent of coverage by protected areas. About 80% of Earth’s terrestrial surface remains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>less, but this area is fragmented into ~600,000 patches, more than half of which are <1 square kilometer and only 7% of which are larger than 100 square kilometers. Global protection of ecologically valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>less areas is inadequate. International recognition and protection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>less areas is urgently needed to halt their continued loss.</p>

Characterization of a dynamic metabolon producing the defense compound dhurrin in sorghum
<p>Metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">highway</span></strong>s may be orchestrated by the assembly of sequential enzymes into protein complexes, or metabolons, to facilitate efficient channeling of intermediates and to prevent undesired metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-talk while maintaining metabolic flexibility. Here we report the isolation of the dynamic metabolon that catalyzes the formation of the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin, a defense compound produced in sorghum plants. The metabolon was reconstituted in liposomes, which demonstrated the importance of membrane surface charge and the presence of the glucosyltransferase for metabolic channeling. We used in planta fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to study functional and structural characteristics of the metabolon. Understanding the regulation of biosynthetic metabolons offers opportunities to optimize synthetic biology approaches for efficient production of high-value products in heterologous hosts.</p>

Increased spatiotemporal resolution reveals highly dynamic dense tubular matrices in the peripheral ER
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an expansive, membrane-enclosed organelle that plays crucial roles in numerous cellular functions. We used emerging superresolution imaging technologies to clarify the morphology and dynamics of the peripheral ER, which contacts and modulates most other intracellular organelles. Peripheral components of the ER have classically been described as comprising both tubules and flat sheets. We show that this system consists almost exclusively of tubules at varying densities, including structures that we term ER matrices. Conventional optical imaging technologies had led to misidentification of these structures as sheets because of the dense clustering of tubular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s and a previously uncharacterized rapid form of ER motion. The existence of ER matrices explains previous confounding evidence that had indicated the occurrence of ER “sheet” proliferation after overexpression of tubular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>–forming proteins.</p>

Restoration of Large Damage Volumes in Polymers
<sec><title>Self-Healing Larger Wounds</title><p>By loading a polymer with pockets of monomer, it is possible to heal small cracks in a sample through the polymerization of the monomer following the formation of a crack.

After injecting a damaged site with precursors, a gel with reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-links rapidly formed, so the material stayed in place that then solidified further upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-linking.

Alternative Oxidase Capacity of Mitochondria in Microsporophylls May Function in Cycad Thermogenesis
<p>Cone thermogenesis is a widespread phenomenon in cycads and may function to promote volatile emissions that affect pollinator behavior. Given their large population size and intense and durable heat-producing effects, cycads are important organisms for comprehensive studies of plant thermogenesis. However, knowledge of mitochondrial morphology and function in cone thermogenesis is limited. Therefore, we investigated these mitochondrial properties in the thermogenic cycad species <i>Cycas revoluta</i>. Male cones generated heat even in cool weather conditions. Female cones produced heat, but to a lesser extent than male cones. Ultrastructural analyses of the two major tissues of male cones, microsporophylls and microsporangia, revealed the existence of a population of mitochondria with a distinct morphology in the microsporophylls. In these cells, we observed large mitochondria (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-sectional area of 2 μm<sup>2</sup> or more) with a uniform matrix density that occupied >10% of the total mitochondrial volume. Despite the size difference, many nonlarge mitochondria (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-sectional area <2 μm<sup>2</sup>) also exhibited a shape and a matrix density similar to those of large mitochondria. Alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and expression levels in microsporophylls were much higher than those in microsporangia. The <i>AOX</i> genes expressed in male cones revealed two different <i>AOX</i> complementary DNA sequences: <i>CrAOX1</i> and <i>CrAOX2</i>. The expression level of <i>CrAOX1</i> mRNA in the microsporophylls was 100 times greater than that of <i>CrAOX2</i> mRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that distinctive mitochondrial morphology and CrAOX1-mediated respiration in microsporophylls might play a role in cycad cone thermogenesis.</p>

Reduction in Root Secondary Growth as a Strategy for Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>We tested the hypothesis that reduced root secondary growth of dicotyledonous species improves phosphorus acquisition. Functional-structural modeling in SimRoot indicates that, in common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), reduced root secondary growth reduces root metabolic costs, increases root length, improves phosphorus capture, and increases shoot biomass in low-phosphorus soil. Observations from the field and greenhouse confirm that, under phosphorus stress, resource allocation is shifted from secondary to primary root growth, genetic variation exists for this response, and reduced secondary growth improves phosphorus capture from low-phosphorus soil. Under low phosphorus in greenhouse mesocosms, genotypes with reduced secondary growth had 39% smaller root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-sectional area, 60% less root respiration, 27% greater root length, 78% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 68% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary growth. In the field under low phosphorus, these genotypes had 43% smaller root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong>-sectional area, 32% greater root length, 58% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 80% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary growth. Secondary growth eliminated arbuscular mycorrhizal associations as cortical tissue was destroyed. These results support the hypothesis that reduced root secondary growth is an adaptive response to low phosphorus availability and merits investigation as a potential breeding target.</p>

PaCeQuant: A Tool for High-Throughput Quantification of Pavement Cell Shape Characteristics
<p>Pavement cells (PCs) are the most frequently occurring cell type in the leaf epidermis and play important roles in leaf growth and function. In many plant species, PCs form highly complex jigsaw-puzzle-shaped cells with interlocking lobes. Understanding of their development is of high interest for plant science research because of their importance for leaf growth and hence for plant fitness and crop yield. Studies of PC development, however, are limited, because robust methods are lacking that enable automatic segmentation and quantification of PC shape parameters suitable to reflect their cellular complexity. Here, we present our new ImageJ-based tool, PaCeQuant, which provides a fully automatic image analysis workflow for PC shape quantification. PaCeQuant automatically detects cell boundaries of PCs from confocal input images and enables manual correction of automatic segmentation results or direct import of manually segmented cells. PaCeQuant simultaneously extracts 27 shape features that include global, contour-based, skeleton-based, and PC-specific object descriptors. In addition, we included a method for classification and analysis of lobes at two-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s and three-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">junction</span></strong>s, respectively. We provide an R script for graphical visualization and statistical analysis. We validated PaCeQuant by extensive comparative analysis to manual segmentation and existing quantification tools and demonstrated its usability to analyze PC shape characteristics during development and between different genotypes. PaCeQuant thus provides a platform for robust, efficient, and reproducible quantitative analysis of PC shape characteristics that can easily be applied to study PC development in large data sets.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Plant Glandular Trichomes: Natural Cell Factories of High Biotechnological Interest
<p>Multicellular glandular trichomes are epidermal outgrowths characterized by the presence of a head made of cells that have the ability to secrete or store large quantities of specialized metabolites. Our understanding of the transcriptional control of glandular trichome initiation and development is still in its infancy. This review points to some central questions that need to be addressed to better understand how such specialized cell structures arise from the plant protodermis. A key and unique feature of glandular trichomes is their ability to synthesize and secrete large amounts, relative to their size, of a limited number of metabolites. As such, they qualify as true cell factories, making them interesting targets for metabolic engineering. In this review, recent advances regarding terpene metabolic engineering are highlighted, with a special focus on tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). In particular, the choice of transcriptional promoters to drive transgene expression and the best ways to sink existing pools of terpene precursors are discussed. The bioavailability of existing pools of natural precursor molecules is a key parameter and is controlled by so-called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> talk between different biosynthetic pathways. As highlighted in this review, the exact nature and extent of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross</span></strong> talk are only partially understood at present. In the future, awareness of, and detailed knowledge on, the biology of plant glandular trichome development and metabolism will generate new leads to tap the largely unexploited potential of glandular trichomes in plant resistance to pests and lead to the improved production of specialized metabolites with high industrial or pharmacological value.</p>

Selective Targeting of Mobile mRNAs to Plasmodesmata for Cell-to-Cell Movement
<p>Many plant mRNAs move from cell to cell or long distance to execute non-cell-autonomous functions. These mobile mRNAs traffic through the phloem to regulate many developmental processes, but despite the burgeoning discovery of mobile mRNAs, little is known about the mechanism underlying the intracellular sorting of these mRNAs. Here, we exploited a fluorescence-based mRNA labeling system, using the bacteriophage coat protein MS2, fused to GFP (MS2-GFP) and an MS2 recognition site in the RNA of interest, to visualize the intracellular trafficking of mobile mRNAs in living plant cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We first improved this system by using the nuclear localization sequence from FD, which substantially reduced the fluorescent background of MS2-GFP in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>. The modified system allowed us to observe the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic fluorescent foci dependent on MS2-binding sites. Coexpressing the MS2-GFP system with a virus movement protein, which is a plasmodesmata (PD)-localized nonspecific RNA-binding protein, targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic fluorescent foci to the PD, suggesting that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic fluorescent foci contain mRNA and MS2-GFP. Our ex vivo RNA imaging revealed that mobile but not nonmobile mRNAs were selectively targeted to PD. Real-time images of intracellular translocation revealed that the translocation of mRNA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es in the transvacuolar strands may be governed by the same mechanism. Our study suggests that PD targeting of mRNA is a selective step in determining mRNA cell-to-cell movement of mRNAs.</p>

MerTK signaling in macrophages promotes the synthesis of inflammation resolution mediators by suppressing CaMKII activity
<p>Inflammation resolution counterbalances excessive inflammation and restores tissue homeostasis after injury. Failure of resolution contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. Resolution is mediated by endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), which are derived from long-chain fatty acids by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. 5-LOX plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of two classes of SPMs: lipoxins and resolvins. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic localization of the nonphosphorylated form of 5-LOX is essential for SPM biosynthesis, whereas nuclear localization of phosphorylated 5-LOX promotes proinflammatory leukotriene production. We previously showed that MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor on macrophages, promotes SPM biosynthesis by increasing the abundance of nonphosphorylated, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic 5-LOX. We now show that activation of MerTK in human macrophages led to ERK-mediated expression of the gene encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which decreased the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and suppressed the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This, in turn, reduced the activities of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and the kinase MK2, resulting in the increased abundance of the nonphosphorylated, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic form of 5-LOX and enhanced SPM biosynthesis. In a zymosan-induced peritonitis model, an inflammatory setting in which macrophage MerTK activation promotes resolution, inhibition of ERK activation delayed resolution, which was characterized by an increased number of neutrophils and decreased amounts of SPMs in tissue exudates. These findings contribute to our understanding of how MerTK signaling induces 5-LOX–derived SPM biosynthesis and suggest a therapeutic strategy to boost inflammation resolution in settings where defective resolution promotes disease progression.</p>

A cytoplasmic role of Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional cofactors Bcl9, Bcl9l, and Pygopus in tooth enamel formation
<p>Wnt-stimulated β-catenin transcriptional regulation is necessary for the development of most organs, including teeth. Bcl9 and Bcl9l are tissue-specific transcriptional cofactors that cooperate with β-catenin. In the nucleus, Bcl9 and Bcl9l simultaneously bind β-catenin and the transcriptional activator Pygo2 to promote the transcription of a subset of Wnt target genes. We showed that Bcl9 and Bcl9l function in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong> during tooth enamel formation in a manner that is independent of Wnt-stimulated β-catenin–dependent transcription. Bcl9, Bcl9l, and Pygo2 localized mainly to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong> of the epithelial-derived ameloblasts, the cells responsible for enamel production. In ameloblasts, Bcl9 interacted with proteins involved in enamel formation and proteins involved in exocytosis and vesicular trafficking. Conditional deletion of both Bcl9 and Bcl9l or both Pygo1 and Pygo2 in mice produced teeth with defective enamel that was bright white and deficient in iron, which is reminiscent of human tooth enamel pathologies. Overall, our data revealed that these proteins, originally defined through their function as β-catenin transcriptional cofactors, function in odontogenesis through a previously uncharacterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic mechanism, revealing that they have roles beyond that of transcriptional cofactors.</p>

Calibrated mitotic oscillator drives motile ciliogenesis
<p>Cell division and differentiation depend on massive and rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e remodeling. The mitotic oscillator, centered on the cyclin-dependent kinase 1–anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (CDK1-APC/C) axis, spatiotemporally coordinates this reorganization in dividing cells. Here we discovered that nondividing cells could also implement this mitotic clocklike regulatory circuit to orchestrate subcellular reorganization associated with differentiation. We probed centriole amplification in differentiating mouse-brain multiciliated cells. These postmitotic progenitors fine-tuned mitotic oscillator activity to drive the orderly progression of centriole production, maturation, and motile ciliation while avoiding the mitosis commitment threshold. Insufficient CDK1 activity hindered differentiation, whereas excessive activity accelerated differentiation yet drove postmitotic progenitors into mitosis. Thus, postmitotic cells can redeploy and calibrate the mitotic oscillator to uncouple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic from nuclear dynamics for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e remodeling associated with differentiation.</p>

Assembly principles and structure of a 6.5-MDa bacterial microcompartment shell

Organelle inheritance—what players have skin in the game?

A Poly(A) Ribonuclease Controls the Cellotriose-Based Interaction between <i>Piriformospora indica</i> and Its Host Arabidopsis
<p><i>Piriformospora indica</i>, an endophytic root-colonizing fungus, efficiently promotes plant growth and induces resistance to abiotic stress and biotic diseases. <i>P. indica</i> fungal cell wall extract induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic calcium elevation in host plant roots. Here, we show that cellotriose (CT) is an elicitor-active cell wall moiety released by <i>P. indica</i> into the medium. CT induces a mild defense-like response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, changes in membrane potential, and the expression of genes involved in growth regulation and root development. CT-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic calcium elevation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots does not require the BAK1 coreceptor or the putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels TPC1, GLR3.3, GLR2.4, and GLR2.5 and operates synergistically with the elicitor chitin. We identified an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant (<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic</i> <i>calcium elevation mutant</i>) impaired in the response to CT and various other cellooligomers (<i>n</i> = 2–7), but not to chitooligomers (<i>n</i> = 4–8), in roots. The mutant contains a single nucleotide exchange in the gene encoding a poly(A) ribonuclease (AtPARN; At1g55870) that degrades the poly(A) tails of specific mRNAs. The wild-type <i>PARN</i> cDNA, expressed under the control of a 35S promoter, complements the mutant phenotype. Our identification of cellotriose as a novel chemical mediator casts light on the complex <i>P. indica</i>-plant mutualistic relationship.</p>

Three-Dimensional Analysis of Chloroplast Structures Associated with Virus Infection
<p>Chloroplasts are multifunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es whose morphology is affected by environmental stresses. Although the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of thylakoid membranes has been reported previously, a 3D visualization of chloroplast under stress has not been explored. In this work, we used a positive-strand RNA ((+)RNA) virus, barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) to observe chloroplast structural changes during infection by electron tomography. The analyses revealed remodeling of the chloroplast membranes, characterized by the clustering of outer membrane-invaginated spherules in inner membrane-derived packets. Diverse morphologies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic invaginations (CIs) were evident with spherules at the periphery and different sized openings connecting the CIs to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>. Immunoelectron microscopy of these viral components verified that the aberrant membrane structures were sites for BSMV replication. The BSMV αa replication protein localized at the surface of the chloroplasts and played a prominent role in eliciting chloroplast membrane rearrangements. In sum, our results have revealed the 3D structure of the chloroplasts induced by BSMV infection. These findings contribute to our understanding of chloroplast morphological changes under stress conditions and during assembly of plant (+)RNA virus replication complexes.</p>

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of elevated ozone (1.4× ambient) and temperature (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. Temperature treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated temperature caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by elevated temperature and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated temperature increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air temperature elevation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but temperatures are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Diacylglycerol kinase ζ limits the polarized recruitment of diacylglycerol-enriched organelles to the immune synapse in T cells
<p>The antigen-induced formation of an immune synapse (IS) between T cells and antigen-presenting cells results in the rapid generation of the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) in T cells. Diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ) converts DAG into phosphatidic acid (PA). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from mice deficient in DGKζ have enhanced antiviral and antitumor activities, indicating that the amount of DAG controls the effectiveness of the T cell response. We characterized the second C1 domain of protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ), a DAG-binding protein that is specifically recruited to the IS, as a biological sensor to observe the generation of a DAG gradient during IS formation. In experiments with transgenic mouse CTLs expressing the OT-I T cell receptor (TCR), we showed that both strong and weak interactions between antigen and the TCR led to the rapid generation of DAG, whereas only strong interactions induced the movement of DAG-enriched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es toward the IS. In DGKζ-deficient CTLs, antigen stimulation led to the enhanced accumulation of DAG-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es at the IS; however, impaired activation of the PA effector PKCζ resulted in lack of reorientation of the microtubule-organizing center toward the IS, a process needed for effective T cell activation. Together, these data suggest that the activation of DGKζ downstream of antigen recognition provides a mechanism that ensures the activation of PA-dependent signaling as a direct result of the strength of TCR-dependent DAG mobilization.</p>

The pseudokinase MLKL activates PAD4-dependent NET formation in necroptotic neutrophils
<p>Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation can generate short-term, functional anucleate cytoplasts and trigger loss of cell viability. We demonstrated that the necroptotic cell death effector mixed lineage kinase domain–like (MLKL) translocated from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong> to the plasma membrane and stimulated downstream NADPH oxidase–independent ROS production, loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic granules, breakdown of the nuclear membrane, chromatin decondensation, histone hypercitrullination, and extrusion of bacteriostatic NETs. This process was coordinated by receptor-interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1), which activated the caspase-8–dependent apoptotic or RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptotic death of mouse and human neutrophils. Genetic deficiency of RIPK3 and MLKL prevented NET formation but did not prevent cell death, which was because of residual caspase-8–dependent activity. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) was activated downstream of RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL and was required for maximal histone hypercitrullination and NET extrusion. This work defines a distinct signaling network that activates PAD4-dependent NET release for the control of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) infection.</p>

Inhibition of the acetyltransferase NAT10 normalizes progeric and aging cells by rebalancing the Transportin-1 nuclear import pathway
<p>Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is an incurable premature aging disease. Identifying deregulated biological processes in HGPS might thus help define novel therapeutic strategies. Fibroblasts from HGPS patients display defects in nucleo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic shuttling of the GTP-bound form of the small GTPase Ran (RanGTP), which leads to abnormal transport of proteins into the nucleus. We report that microtubule stabilization in HGPS cells sequestered the nonclassical nuclear import protein Transportin-1 (TNPO1) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>, thus affecting the nuclear localization of its cargo, including the nuclear pore protein NUP153. Consequently, nuclear Ran, nuclear anchorage of the nucleoporin TPR, and chromatin organization were disrupted, deregulating gene expression and inducing senescence. Inhibiting <i>N</i>-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) ameliorated HGPS phenotypes by rebalancing the nuclear to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic ratio of TNPO1. This restored nuclear pore complex integrity and nuclear Ran localization, thereby correcting HGPS cellular phenotypes. We observed a similar mechanism in cells from healthy aged individuals. This study identifies a nuclear import pathway affected in aging and underscores the potential for NAT10 inhibition as a possible therapeutic strategy for HGPS and perhaps also for pathologies associated with normal aging.</p>

Chemical synapses without synaptic vesicles: Purinergic neurotransmission through a CALHM1 channel-mitochondrial signaling complex
<p>Conventional chemical synapses in the nervous system involve a presynaptic accumulation of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane to release neurotransmitters that activate postsynaptic receptors. In taste buds, type II receptor cells do not have conventional synaptic features but nonetheless show regulated release of their afferent neurotransmitter, ATP, through a large-pore, voltage-gated channel, CALHM1. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CALHM1 was localized to points of contact between the receptor cells and sensory nerve fibers. Ultrastructural and super-resolution light microscopy showed that the CALHM1 channels were consistently associated with distinctive, large (1- to 2-μm) mitochondria spaced 20 to 40 nm from the presynaptic membrane. Pharmacological disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain limited the ability of taste cells to release ATP, suggesting that the immediate source of released ATP was the mitochondrion rather than a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic pool of ATP. These large mitochondria may serve as both a reservoir of releasable ATP and the site of synthesis. The juxtaposition of the large mitochondria to areas of membrane displaying CALHM1 also defines a restricted compartment that limits the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon opening of the nonselective CALHM1 channels. These findings reveal a distinctive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e signature and functional organization for regulated, focal release of purinergic signals in the absence of synaptic vesicles.</p>

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins

Low RNA/protein ratios promote phase separation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive phase separation and the formation of cytotoxic solid-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.</p>

No functional ortholog for any ERMES protein has been identified in metazoans. Here, we identified PDZD8 as an ER protein present at ER-mitochondria contacts. The SMP domain of PDZD8 is functionally orthologous to the SMP domain found in yeast Mmm1. PDZD8 was necessary for the formation of ER-mitochondria contacts in mammalian cells. In neurons, PDZD8 was required for calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) uptake by mitochondria after synaptically induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release from ER and thereby regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics.

Peripheral components of the ER have classically been described as comprising both tubules and flat sheets. We show that this system consists almost exclusively of tubules at varying densities, including structures that we term ER matrices. Conventional optical imaging technologies had led to misidentification of these structures as sheets because of the dense clustering of tubular junctions and a previously uncharacterized rapid form of ER motion. The existence of ER matrices explains previous confounding evidence that had indicated the occurrence of ER “sheet” proliferation after overexpression of tubular junction–forming proteins.</p>

Candidate Enzymes for Saffron Crocin Biosynthesis Are Localized in Multiple Cellular Compartments
<p>Saffron is the dried stigmas of <i>Crocus sativus</i> and is the most expensive spice in the world. Its red color is due to crocins, which are apocarotenoid glycosides that accumulate in the vacuole to a level up to 10% of the stigma dry weight. Previously, we characterized the first dedicated enzyme in the crocin biosynthetic pathway, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase2 (CsCCD2), which cleaves zeaxanthin to yield crocetin dialdehyde. In this work, we identified six putative <i>aldehyde dehydrogenase</i> (<i>ALDH</i>) genes expressed in <i>C. sativus</i> stigmas. Heterologous expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> showed that only one of corresponding proteins (CsALDH3I1) was able to convert crocetin dialdehyde into the crocin precursor crocetin. CsALDH3I1 carries a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain, similar to that of the <i>Neurospora crassa</i> membrane-associated apocarotenoid dehydrogenase YLO-1. We also characterized the UDP-glycosyltransferase CsUGT74AD1, which converts crocetin to crocins 1 and 2′. In vitro assays revealed high specificity of CsALDH3I1 for crocetin dialdehyde and long-chain apocarotenals and of CsUGT74AD1 for crocetin. Following extract fractionation, CsCCD2, CsALDH3I1, and CsUGT74AD1 were found in the insoluble fraction, suggesting their association with membranes or large insoluble complexes. Analysis of protein localization in both <i>C. sativus</i> stigmas and following transgene expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves revealed that CsCCD2, CsALDH3I, and CsUGT74AD1 were localized to the plastids, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>, respectively, in association with cytoskeleton-like structures. Based on these findings and current literature, we propose that the endoplasmic reticulum and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong> function as transit centers for metabolites whose biosynthesis starts in the plastid and are accumulated in the vacuole.</p>

RECX Interacts with Mitochondrial RECA to Maintain Mitochondrial Genome Stability
<p>The chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes are essential for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. RECA and RECG, which are plant-specific homologs of the bacterial homologous recombination repair proteins RecA and RecG, maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e genome stability by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats (SDRs) in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. In this study, we analyzed the plant-specific factor RECX, a homolog of bacterial RecX that regulates RecA. RECX fused to GFP colocalized with mitochondrial RECA1 and chloroplast RECA2 on mitochondrial and chloroplast nucleoids, respectively. Knockout (KO) and overexpression (OEX) of <i>RECX</i> did not alter the <i>P. patens</i> morphological phenotype. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, however, showed that products from recombination between SDRs increased significantly in <i>RECX</i> OEX mitochondria and modestly in <i>RECX</i> KO mitochondria. By contrast, analysis of chloroplast DNA revealed no substantial alteration in the number of products from recombination between SDRs in <i>RECX</i> KO and OEX chloroplasts. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed interactions between RECX and RECA1 and between RECX and RECA2. Expression profiles showed a positive correlation between <i>RECX</i> and factors maintaining the stability of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e genomes and <i>RECA1</i>. Collectively, these results suggest that RECX maintains mitochondrial genome stability, likely by modulating RECA1 activity, and that the compromised function of RECX induces mitochondrial genome instability.</p>

Revisiting the Algal “Chloroplast Lipid Droplet”: The Absence of an Entity That Is Unlikely to Exist
<p>The precise localization of the lipid droplets and the metabolic pathways associated with oil production are crucial to the engineering of microalgae for biofuel production. Several studies have reported detecting lipid droplets within the chloroplast of the microalga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, which accumulates considerable amounts of triacylglycerol and starch within the cell under nitrogen deprivation or high-light stress conditions. Starch undoubtedly accumulates within the chloroplast, but there have been debates on the localization of the lipid droplets, which are cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es in other organisms. Although it is impossible to prove an absence, we tried to repeat experiments that previously indicated the presence of lipid droplets in chloroplasts. Here, we present microscopic results showing no evidence for the presence of lipid droplets within the chloroplast stroma, even though some lipid droplets existed in close association with the chloroplast or were largely engulfed by the chloroplasts. These lipid droplets are cytosolic structures, distinct from the plastoglobules present in the chloroplast stroma. These results not only contrast with the old ideas but also point out that what were previously thought to be chloroplast lipid droplets are likely to be embedded within chloroplast invaginations in association with the outer envelope of the chloroplast without intervention of the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings point to the intriguing possibility of a tight metabolic flow from the chloroplast to the lipid droplet through a close association rather than direct contact of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es.</p>

Vacuolar Trafficking Protein VPS38 Is Dispensable for Autophagy
<p>Phosphatidylinositol 3-P (PI3P) is a signaling molecule that controls a variety of processes in endosomal, autophagic, and vacuolar/lysosomal trafficking in yeasts and mammals. Vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34) is a conserved PI3K present in multiple complexes with specific functions and regulation. In yeast, the PI3K complex II consists of Vps34p, Vps15p, Vps30p/Atg6p, and Vps38p, and is essential for vacuolar protein sorting. Here, we describe the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homolog of yeast Vps38p and human UV radiation resistance-associated gene protein. Arabidopsis VPS38 interacts with VPS30/ATG6 both in yeast and in planta. Although the level of PI3P in Arabidopsis <i>vps38</i> mutants is similar to that in wild type, <i>vps38</i> cells contain enlarged multivesicular endosomes and fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es enriched in PI3P than the wild type. The <i>vps38</i> mutants are defective in the trafficking of vacuolar cargo and its receptor VACUOLAR SORTING RECEPTOR2;1. The mutants also exhibit abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic distributions of endocytic cargo, such as auxin efflux carriers PINFORMED1 (PIN1) and PIN2. Constitutive autophagy is normal in the mutants but starvation-induced autophagy was slightly inhibited. We conclude that Arabidopsis VPS38 is dispensable for autophagy but essential for efficient targeting of biosynthetic and endocytic cargo to the vacuole.</p>

EXO70C2 Is a Key Regulatory Factor for Optimal Tip Growth of Pollen
<p>The exocyst, a eukaryotic tethering complex, coregulates targeted exocytosis as an effector of small GTPases in polarized cell growth. In land plants, several exocyst subunits are encoded by double or triple paralogs, culminating in tens of EXO70 paralogs. Out of 23 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> EXO70 isoforms, we analyzed seven isoforms expressed in pollen. Genetic and microscopic analyses of single mutants in <i>EXO70A2</i>, <i>EXO70C1</i>, <i>EXO70C2</i>, <i>EXO70F1</i>, <i>EXO70H3</i>, <i>EXO70H5</i>, and <i>EXO70H6</i> genes revealed that only a loss-of-function <i>EXO70C2</i> allele resulted in a significant male-specific transmission defect (segregation 40%:51%:9%) due to aberrant pollen tube growth. Mutant pollen tubes grown in vitro exhibited an enhanced growth rate and a decreased thickness of the tip cell wall, causing tip bursts. However, <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes could frequently recover and restart their speedy elongation, resulting in a repetitive stop-and-go growth dynamics. A pollen-specific depletion of the closest paralog, <i>EXO70C1</i>, using artificial microRNA in the <i>exo70C2</i> mutant background, resulted in a complete pollen-specific transmission defect, suggesting redundant functions of EXO70C1 and EXO70C2. Both EXO70C1 and EXO70C2, GFP tagged and expressed under the control of their native promoters, localized in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong> of pollen grains, pollen tubes, and also root trichoblast cells. The expression of EXO70C2-GFP complemented the aberrant growth of <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes. The absent EXO70C2 interactions with core exocyst subunits in the yeast two-hybrid assay, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic localization, and genetic effect suggest an unconventional EXO70 function possibly as a regulator of exocytosis outside the exocyst complex. In conclusion, EXO70C2 is a novel factor contributing to the regulation of optimal tip growth of Arabidopsis pollen tubes.</p>

The <i>Synechocystis</i> Manganese Exporter Mnx Is Essential for Manganese Homeostasis in Cyanobacteria
<p>The essential micronutrient manganese (Mn) functions as redox-active cofactor in active sites of enzymes and, thus, is involved in various physiological reactions. Moreover, in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, Mn is of special importance, since it is central to the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II. Although Mn is an essential micronutrient, increased amounts are detrimental to the organism; thus, only a small window exists for beneficial concentrations. Accordingly, Mn homeostasis must be carefully maintained. In contrast to the well-studied uptake mechanisms in cyanobacteria, it is largely unknown how Mn is distributed to the different compartments inside the cell. We identified a protein with so far unknown function as a hypothetical Mn transporter in the cyanobacterial model strain <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and named this protein Mnx for Mn exporter. The knockout mutant Δ<i>mnx</i> showed increased sensitivity toward externally supplied Mn and Mn toxicity symptoms, which could be linked to intracellular Mn accumulation. <sup>54</sup>Mn chase experiments demonstrated that the mutant was not able to release Mn from the internal pool. Microscopic analysis of a Mnx::yellow fluorescent protein fusion showed that the protein resides in the thylakoid membrane. Heterologous expression of <i>mnx</i> suppressed the Mn-sensitive phenotype of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> mutant Δ<i>pmr1</i>. Our results indicate that Mnx functions as a thylakoid Mn transporter and is a key player in maintaining Mn homeostasis in <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. We propose that Mn export from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong> into the thylakoid lumen is crucial to prevent toxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic Mn accumulation and to ensure Mn provision to photosystem II.</p>

<i>Defective Pollen Wall 2</i> (<i>DPW2</i>) Encodes an Acyl Transferase Required for Rice Pollen Development
<p>Aliphatic and aromatic lipids are both essential structural components of the plant cuticle, an important interface between the plant and environment. Although cross links between aromatic and aliphatic or other moieties are known to be associated with the formation of leaf cutin and root and seed suberin, the contribution of aromatic lipids to the biosynthesis of anther cuticles and pollen walls remains elusive. In this study, we characterized the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) male sterile mutant, <i>defective pollen wall 2</i> (<i>dpw2</i>), which showed an abnormal anther cuticle, a defective pollen wall, and complete male sterility. Compared with the wild type, <i>dpw2</i> anthers have increased amounts of cutin and waxes and decreased levels of lipidic and phenolic compounds. <i>DPW2</i> encodes a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ically localized BAHD acyltransferase. In vitro assays demonstrated that recombinant DPW2 specifically transfers hydroxycinnamic acid moieties, using ω-hydroxy fatty acids as acyl acceptors and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs as acyl donors. Thus, The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:ω-hydroxy fatty acid transferase DPW2 plays a fundamental role in male reproduction via the biosynthesis of key components of the anther cuticle and pollen wall.</p>

Genetic Interactions between PEROXIN12 and Other Peroxisome-Associated Ubiquitination Components
<p>Most eukaryotic cells require peroxisomes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es housing fatty acid β-oxidation and other critical metabolic reactions. Peroxisomal matrix proteins carry peroxisome-targeting signals that are recognized by one of two receptors, PEX5 or PEX7, in the cytosol. After delivering the matrix proteins to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e, these receptors are removed from the peroxisomal membrane or matrix. Receptor retrotranslocation not only facilitates further rounds of matrix protein import but also prevents deleterious PEX5 retention in the membrane. Three peroxisome-associated ubiquitin-protein ligases in the Really Interesting New Gene (RING) family, PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12, facilitate PEX5 retrotranslocation. However, the detailed mechanism of receptor retrotranslocation remains unclear in plants. We identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>pex12</i> Glu-to-Lys missense allele that conferred severe peroxisomal defects, including impaired β-oxidation, inefficient matrix protein import, and decreased growth. We compared this <i>pex12-1</i> mutant to other peroxisome-associated ubiquitination-related mutants and found that RING peroxin mutants displayed elevated PEX5 and PEX7 levels, supporting the involvement of RING peroxins in receptor ubiquitination in Arabidopsis. Also, we observed that disruption of any Arabidopsis RING peroxin led to decreased PEX10 levels, as seen in yeast and mammals. Peroxisomal defects were exacerbated in RING peroxin double mutants, suggesting distinct roles of individual RING peroxins. Finally, reducing function of the peroxisome-associated ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme PEX4 restored PEX10 levels and partially ameliorated the other molecular and physiological defects of the <i>pex12-1</i> mutant. Future biochemical analyses will be needed to determine whether destabilization of the RING peroxin complex observed in <i>pex12-1</i> stems from PEX4-dependent ubiquitination on the pex12-1 ectopic Lys residue.</p>

ChloroMitoSSRDB is a complete curated web-oriented relational database of perfect and imperfect repeats in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e genomes. The present version of the database contains perfect and imperfect SSRs of 2161 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e genomes (1982 mitochondrial and 179 chloroplast genomes). We detected a total of 5838 chloroplast perfect SSRs, 37 297 chloroplast imperfect SSRs, 5898 mitochondrial perfect SSRs and 50 355 mitochondrial imperfect SSRs across these genomes. The repeats have been further hyperlinked to the annotated gene regions (coding or non-coding) and a link to the corresponding gene record in National Center for Biotechnology Information(<ext-link>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) to identify and understand the positional relationship of the repetitive tracts. ChloroMitoSSRDB is connected to a user-friendly web interface that provides useful information associated with the location of the repeats (coding and non-coding), size of repeat, motif and length polymorphism, etc. ChloroMitoSSRDB will serve as a repository for developing functional markers for molecular phylogenetics, estimating molecular variation across species.

Disease Models & Mechanisms
An atrial-fibrillation-linked connexin40 mutant is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and impairs the function of atrial gap-junction channels
<p>Connexin40 (Cx40)-containing gap-junction channels are expressed in the atrial myocardium and provide a low-resistance passage for rapid impulse propagation. A germline mutation in the <i>GJA5</i> gene, which encodes Cx40, resulting in a truncated Cx40 (Q49X) was identified in a large Chinese family with lone (idiopathic) atrial fibrillation (AF). This mutation co-segregated with seven AF probands in an autosomal-dominant way over generations. To test the hypothesis that this Cx40 mutant affects the distribution and function of atrial gap junctions, we studied the Q49X mutant in gap-junction-deficient HeLa and N2A cells. The Q49X mutant, unlike wild-type Cx40, was typically localized in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong> and failed to form gap-junction plaques at cell-cell interfaces. When the Q49X mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43, the mutant substantially reduced the gap-junction plaque formation of Cx40 and Cx43. Electrophysiological studies revealed no electrical coupling of cell pairs expressing the mutant alone and a significant decrease in the coupling conductance when the mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43. Further colocalization experiments with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e residential proteins indicate that Q49X was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings provide evidence that the Q49X mutant is capable of impairing gap-junction distribution and function of key atrial connexins, which might play a role in the predisposition to and onset of AF.</p>

The <i>Drosophila</i> MAST kinase Drop out is required to initiate membrane compartmentalisation during cellularisation and regulates dynein-based transport
<p>Cellularisation of the <i>Drosophila</i> syncytial blastoderm embryo into the polarised blastoderm epithelium provides an excellent model with which to determine how cortical plasma membrane asymmetry is generated during development. Many components of the molecular machinery driving cellularisation have been identified, but cell signalling events acting at the onset of membrane asymmetry are poorly understood. Here we show that mutations in <i>drop out</i> (<i>dop</i>) disturb the segregation of membrane cortical compartments and the clustering of E-cadherin into basal adherens junctions in early cellularisation. <i>dop</i> is required for normal furrow formation and controls the tight localisation of furrow canal proteins and the formation of F-actin foci at the incipient furrows. We show that <i>dop</i> encodes the single <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of microtubule-associated Ser/Thr (MAST) kinases. <i>dop</i> interacts genetically with components of the dynein/dynactin complex and promotes dynein-dependent transport in the embryo. Loss of <i>dop</i> function reduces phosphorylation of Dynein intermediate chain, suggesting that <i>dop</i> is involved in regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic dynein activity through direct or indirect mechanisms. These data suggest that Dop impinges upon the initiation of furrow formation through developmental regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic dynein.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p>Plastid transformation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in plastid biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a plastid-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that plastid transformation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the plastid-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. Plastid transformation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>. We obtained one to two plastid transformation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced plastid transformation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis plastid transformation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to plastid transformation provides a rational template to implement plastid transformation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

SCYL2 Genes Are Involved in Clathrin-Mediated Vesicle Trafficking and Essential for Plant Growth
<p>Protein transport between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells and is mediated by the regulation of processes such as vesicle formation, transport, docking, and fusion. In animals, SCY1-LIKE2 (SCYL2) binds to clathrin and has been shown to play roles in trans-Golgi network-mediated clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking. Here, we demonstrate that SCYL2A and SCYL2B, which are Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs of animal SCYL2, are vital for plant cell growth and root hair development. Studies of the SCYL2 isoforms using multiple single or double loss-of-function alleles show that SCYL2B is involved in root hair development and that SCYL2A and SCYL2B are essential for plant growth and development and act redundantly in those processes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a β-glucuronidase-aided promoter assay show that <i>SCYL2A</i> and <i>SCYL2B</i> are differentially expressed in various tissues. We also show that SCYL2 proteins localize to the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and prevacuolar compartment and colocalize with Clathrin Heavy Chain1 (CHC1). Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation data show that SCYL2B interacts with CHC1 and two Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptors (SNAREs): Vesicle Transport through t-SNARE Interaction11 (VTI11) and VTI12. Finally, we present evidence that the root hair tip localization of Cellulose Synthase-Like D3 is dependent on SCYL2B. These findings suggest the role of SCYL2 genes in plant cell developmental processes via clathrin-mediated vesicle membrane trafficking.</p>

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct vegetative and zygotic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es—the vegetative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

The PEX1 ATPase Stabilizes PEX6 and Plays Essential Roles in Peroxisome Biology
<p>A variety of metabolic pathways are sequestered in peroxisomes, conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es that are essential for human and plant survival. Peroxin (PEX) proteins generate and maintain peroxisomes. The PEX1 ATPase facilitates recycling of the peroxisome matrix protein receptor PEX5 and is the most commonly affected peroxin in human peroxisome biogenesis disorders. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of, to our knowledge, the first Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>pex1</i> missense alleles: <i>pex1-2</i> and <i>pex1-3</i>. <i>pex1-2</i> displayed peroxisome-related defects accompanied by reduced PEX1 and PEX6 levels. These <i>pex1-2</i> defects were exacerbated by growth at high temperature and ameliorated by growth at low temperature or by <i>PEX6</i> overexpression, suggesting that PEX1 enhances PEX6 stability and vice versa. <i>pex1-3</i> conferred embryo lethality when homozygous, confirming that PEX1, like several other Arabidopsis peroxins, is essential for embryogenesis. <i>pex1-3</i> displayed symptoms of peroxisome dysfunction when heterozygous; this semidominance is consistent with PEX1 forming a heterooligomer with PEX6 that is poisoned by pex1-3 subunits. Blocking autophagy partially rescued <i>PEX1</i>/<i>pex1-3</i> defects, including the restoration of normal peroxisome size, suggesting that increasing peroxisome abundance can compensate for the deficiencies caused by <i>pex1-3</i> and that the enlarged peroxisomes visible in <i>PEX1</i>/<i>pex1-3</i> may represent autophagy intermediates. Overexpressing <i>PEX1</i> in wild-type plants impaired growth, suggesting that excessive PEX1 can be detrimental. Our genetic, molecular, and physiological data support the heterohexamer model of PEX1-PEX6 function in plants.</p>

SPA Proteins Affect the Subcellular Localization of COP1 in the COP1/SPA Ubiquitin Ligase Complex during Photomorphogenesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) COP1/SPA ubiquitin ligase is a central repressor that suppresses light signaling in darkness by targeting positive regulators of the light response, mainly transcription factors, for degradation. Light inactivates COP1/SPA, in part by excluding COP1 from the nucleus. SPA proteins are essential cofactors of COP1, but their exact role in the COP1/SPA complex is thus far unknown. To unravel a potential role of SPA proteins in COP1 nucleo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic partitioning, we monitored the subcellular localization of COP1 in a <i>spa1234</i> quadruple mutant (<i>spaQn</i>). We analyzed a YFP-COP1-expressing transgenic line and endogenous COP1 after subcellular fractionation. In dark-grown seedlings, both YFP-COP1 and endogenous COP1 accumulated in the nucleus in the absence and presence of SPA proteins, indicating that SPA proteins are not required for nuclear localization of COP1 in darkness. In contrast, in white light-grown seedlings, <i>spaQn</i> mutants failed to relocalize COP1 from the nucleus to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>. Hence, SPA proteins are necessary for the light-controlled change in COP1 subcellular localization. We conclude that SPA proteins have a dual role: (1) they are required for light-responsiveness of COP1 subcellular localization, and (2) they promote COP1 activity in darkness in a fashion that is independent of the nuclear import/nuclear retention of COP1.</p>

Adaptor Protein-3-Dependent Vacuolar Trafficking Involves a Subpopulation of COPII and HOPS Tethering Proteins
<p>Plant vacuoles are versatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es critical for plant growth and responses to environment. Vacuolar proteins are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum via multiple routes in plants. Two classic routes bear great similarity to other phyla with major regulators known, such as COPII and Rab5 GTPases. By contrast, vacuolar trafficking mediated by adaptor protein-3 (AP-3) or that independent of the Golgi has few recognized cargos and none of the regulators. In search of novel regulators for vacuolar trafficking routes and by using a fluorescence-based forward genetic screen, we demonstrated that the multispan transmembrane protein, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROTEIN <i>S</i>-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10), is an AP-3-mediated vacuolar cargo. We show that the tonoplast targeting of PAT10 is mediated by the AP-3 complex but independent of the Rab5-mediated post-Golgi trafficking route. We also report that AP-3-mediated vacuolar trafficking involves a subpopulation of COPII and requires the vacuolar tethering complex HOPS. In addition, we have identified two novel mutant alleles of <i>AP-3δ</i>, whose point mutations interfered with the formation of the AP-3 complex as well as its membrane targeting. The results presented here shed new light on the vacuolar trafficking route mediated by AP-3 in plant cells.</p>

The Prenylated Rab GTPase Receptor PRA1.F4 Contributes to Protein Exit from the Golgi Apparatus
<p>Prenylated Rab acceptor1 (PRA1) functions in the recruitment of prenylated Rab proteins to their cognate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains a large number of proteins belonging to the AtPRA1 family. However, their physiological roles remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the physiological role of AtPRA1.F4, a member of the AtPRA1 family. A T-DNA insertion knockdown mutant of <i>AtPRA1.F4</i>, <i>atpra1.f4</i>, was smaller in stature than parent plants and possessed shorter roots, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing HA:AtPRA1.F4 showed enhanced development of secondary roots and root hairs. However, both overexpression and knockdown plants exhibited increased sensitivity to high-salt stress, lower vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and plasma membrane ATPase activities, lower and higher pH in the vacuole and apoplast, respectively, and highly vesiculated Golgi apparatus. HA:AtPRA1.F4 localized to the Golgi apparatus and assembled into high-molecular-weight complexes. <i>atpra1.f4</i> plants displayed a defect in vacuolar trafficking, which was complemented by low but not high levels of <i>HA</i>:<i>AtPRA1.F4</i>. Overexpression of HA:AtPRA1.F4 also inhibited protein trafficking at the Golgi apparatus, albeit differentially depending on the final destination or type of protein: trafficking of vacuolar proteins, plasma membrane proteins, and trans-Golgi network (TGN)-localized SYP61 was strongly inhibited; trafficking of TGN-localized SYP51 was slightly inhibited; and trafficking of secretory proteins and TGN-localized SYP41 was negligibly or not significantly inhibited. Based on these results, we propose that Golgi-localized AtPRA1.F4 is involved in the exit of many but not all types of post-Golgi proteins from the Golgi apparatus. Additionally, an appropriate level of AtPRA1.F4 is crucial for its function at the Golgi apparatus.</p>

Vesicle Dynamics during Plant Cell Cytokinesis Reveals Distinct Developmental Phases
<p>Cell division in plant cells requires the deposition of a new cell wall between the two daughter cells. The assembly of this plate requires the coordinated movement of cargo vesicles whose size is below the diffraction-limited resolution of the optical microscope. We combined high spatial and temporal resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy with advanced image-processing tools and fluorescence fluctuation methods and distinguished three distinct phases during cell plate expansion in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) ‘Bright Yellow-2’ cells: massive delivery of preexisting vesicles to a disk-shaped region at the equatorial plane precedes a primary rapid expansion phase followed by a secondary, slow expansion phase during which the extremity of the circular plate seeks contact with the mother wall and brings about the separation of the two portions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>. Different effects of pharmacological inhibition emphasize the distinct nature of the assembly and expansion mechanisms characterizing these phases.</p>

A Key Role for Apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Norway Spruce Phenolic Metabolism
<p>Apoplastic events such as monolignol oxidation and lignin polymerization are difficult to study in intact trees. To investigate the role of apoplastic hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in gymnosperm phenolic metabolism, an extracellular lignin-forming cell culture of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) was used as a research model. Scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by potassium iodide repressed lignin formation, in line with peroxidases activating monolignols for lignin polymerization. Time-course analyses coupled to candidate substrate-product pair network propagation revealed differential accumulation of low-molecular-weight phenolics, including (glycosylated) oligolignols, (glycosylated) flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins, in lignin-forming and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging cultures and supported that monolignols are oxidatively coupled not only in the cell wall but also in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>, where they are coupled to other monolignols and proanthocyanidins. Dilignol glycoconjugates with reduced structures were found in the culture medium, suggesting that cells are able to transport glycosylated dilignols to the apoplast. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in remodulation of the transcriptome, with reduced carbon flux into the shikimate pathway propagating down to monolignol biosynthesis. Aggregated coexpression network analysis identified candidate enzymes and transcription factors for monolignol oxidation and apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in addition to potential H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> receptors. The results presented indicate that the redox state of the apoplast has a profound influence on cellular metabolism.</p>

An Organelle RNA Recognition Motif Protein Is Required for Photosystem II Subunit <i>psbF</i> Transcript Editing
<p>Loss-of-function mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>E RNA RECOGNITION MOTIF PROTEIN6 (ORRM6) result in the near absence of RNA editing of <i>psbF</i>-C77 and the reduction in <i>accD</i>-C794 editing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The <i>orrm6</i> mutants have decreased levels of photosystem II (PSII) proteins, especially PsbF, lower PSII activity, pale green pigmentation, smaller leaf and plant sizes, and retarded growth. Stable expression of <i>ORRM6</i> rescues the <i>orrm6</i> editing defects and mutant phenotype. Unlike ORRM1, the other known ORRM plastid editing factor, ORRM6, does not contain RNA editing interacting protein/multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>ar RNA editing factor (RIP/MORF) boxes, which are required for ORRM1 to interact with site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein editing factors. ORRM6 interacts with RIP1/MORF8, RIP2/MORF2, and RIP9/MORF9, known components of RNA editosomes. While some plastid RRM proteins are involved in other forms of RNA processing and translation, the primary function of ORRM6 is evidently to mediate <i>psbF</i>-C77 editing, like the essential site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein LOW PSII ACCUMULATION66. Stable expression in the <i>orrm6</i> mutants of a nucleus-encoded, plastid-targeted PsbF protein from a <i>psbF</i> gene carrying a T at nucleotide 77 significantly increases leaf and plant sizes, chlorophyll content, and PSII activity. These transformants demonstrate that plastid RNA editing can be bypassed through the expression of nucleus-encoded, edited forms of plastid genes.</p>

Analysis of Exocyst Subunit EXO70 Family Reveals Distinct Membrane Polar Domains in Tobacco Pollen Tubes
<p>The vesicle-tethering complex exocyst is one of the crucial cell polarity regulators. The EXO70 subunit is required for the targeting of the complex and is represented by many isoforms in angiosperm plant cells. This diversity could be partly responsible for the establishment and maintenance of membrane domains with different composition. To address this hypothesis, we employed the growing pollen tube, a well-established cell polarity model system, and performed large-scale expression, localization, and functional analysis of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) EXO70 isoforms. Various isoforms localized to different regions of the pollen tube plasma membrane, apical vesicle-rich inverted cone region, nucleus, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>. The overexpression of major pollen-expressed EXO70 isoforms resulted in growth arrest and characteristic phenotypic deviations of tip swelling and apical invaginations. NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 occupied two distinct and mutually exclusive plasma membrane domains. Both isoforms partly colocalized with the exocyst subunit NtSEC3a at the plasma membrane, possibly forming different exocyst complex subpopulations. NtEXO70A1a localized to the small area previously characterized as the site of exocytosis in the tobacco pollen tube, while NtEXO70B1 surprisingly colocalized with the zone of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Both NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 colocalized to different degrees with markers for the anionic signaling phospholipids phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid. In contrast, members of the EXO70 C class, which are specifically expressed in tip-growing cells, exhibited exocytosis-related functional effects in pollen tubes despite the absence of apparent plasma membrane localization. Taken together, our data support the existence of multiple membrane-trafficking domains regulated by different EXO70-containing exocyst complexes within a single cell.</p>

AIK1, A Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Modulates Abscisic Acid Responses through the MKK5-MPK6 Kinase Cascade<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction module involved in transducing extracellular signals to the nucleus for appropriate cellular adjustment. This cascade essentially consists of three components: a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAPK kinase, and a MAPK, connected to each other by the event of phosphorylation. Here, we report the characterization of a MAPKKK, ABA-INSENSITIVE PROTEIN KINASE1 (AIK1), which regulates abscisic acid (ABA) responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). T-DNA insertion mutants of AIK1 showed insensitivity to ABA in terms of both root growth and stomatal response. AIK1 functions in ABA responses via regulation of root cell division and elongation, as well as stomatal responses. The activity of AIK1 is induced by ABA in Arabidopsis and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>), and the Arabidopsis protein phosphatase type 2C, ABI1, a negative regulator of ABA signaling, restricts AIK1 activity by dephosphorylation. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis showed that MPK3, MPK6, and AIK1 interact with MKK5. The single mutant seedlings of <i>mpk6</i> and <i>mkk5</i> have similar phenotypes to <i>aik1</i>, but <i>mkk4</i> does not. AIK1 was localized in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong> and shown to activate MKK5 by protein phosphorylation, which was an ABA-activated process. Constitutively active MKK5 in <i>aik1</i> mutant seedlings complements the ABA-insensitive root growth phenotype of <i>aik1</i>. The activity of MPK6 was increased by ABA in wild-type seedlings, but its activation by ABA was impaired in <i>aik1</i> and <i>aik1 mkk5</i> mutants. These findings clearly suggest that the AIK1-MKK5-MPK6 cascade functions in the ABA regulation of primary root growth and stomatal response.</p>

The GET System Inserts the Tail-Anchored Protein, SYP72, into Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome encodes homologs of the Guided Entry of Tail (GET)-anchored protein system for the posttranslational insertion of tail-anchored (TA) proteins into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. In yeast, TA proteins are loaded onto the cytosolic targeting factor Get3 and are then delivered to the membrane-associated Get1/2 complex for insertion into ER membranes. The role of the GET system in Arabidopsis was investigated by monitoring the membrane insertion of a tail-anchored protein, SYP72, a syntaxin. SYP72 bound to yeast Get3 in vitro, forming a Get3-SYP72 fusion complex that could be inserted into yeast GET1/2-containing proteoliposomes. The Arabidopsis GET system functioned in vivo to insert TA proteins into ER membranes as demonstrated by the fact that the YFP-tagged SYP72 localized to the ER in wild-type plants but accumulated as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic inclusions in <i>get1</i>, <i>get3</i>, or <i>get4</i> mutants. The GET mutants <i>get1</i> and <i>get3</i> were less tolerant of ER stress agents and showed symptoms of ER stress even under unstressed conditions. Hence, the GET system is responsible for the insertion of TA proteins into the ER in Arabidopsis, and mutants with GET dysfunctions are more susceptible to ER stress.</p>

Homologues of the RPW8 Resistance Protein Are Localized to the Extrahaustorial Membrane that Is Likely Synthesized De Novo
<p>Upon penetration of the host cell wall, the powdery mildew fungus develops a feeding structure named the haustorium in the invaded host cell. Concomitant with haustorial biogenesis, the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) is formed to separate the haustorium from the host cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>. The Arabidopsis resistance protein RPW8.2 is specifically targeted to the EHM where it activates haustorium-targeted resistance against powdery mildew. RPW8.2 belongs to a small family with six members in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Whether Homologs of RPW8 (HR) 1 to HR4 are also localized to the EHM and contribute to resistance has not been determined. Here, we report that overexpression of <i>HR1</i>, <i>HR2</i>, or <i>HR3</i> led to enhanced resistance to powdery mildew, while genetic depletion of <i>HR2</i> or <i>HR3</i> resulted in enhanced susceptibility, indicating that these <i>RPW8</i> homologs contribute to basal resistance. Interestingly, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR1 to HR3 are also EHM-localized. This suggests that EHM-targeting is an ancestral feature of the RPW8 family. Indeed, two RPW8 homologs from <i>Brassica oleracea</i> tested also exhibit EHM-localization. Domain swapping analysis between HR3 and RPW8.2 suggests that sequence diversification in the N-terminal 146 amino acids of RPW8.2 probably functionally distinguishes it from other family members. Moreover, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR3 is also localized to the plasma membrane and the fungal penetration site (the papilla) in addition to the EHM. Using this unique feature of YFP-HR3, we obtained preliminary evidence to suggest that the EHM is unlikely derived from invagination of the plasma membrane, rather it may be mainly synthesized de novo.</p>

VPS36-Dependent Multivesicular Bodies Are Critical for Plasmamembrane Protein Turnover and Vacuolar Biogenesis
<p>Most eukaryotic cells target ubiquitinated plasma membrane (PM) proteins for vacuolar degradation in response to environmental and developmental cues. This process involves endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT). However, little is known about the cellular mechanisms of ESCRTs in plants. Here, we studied the function of one ESCRT-II component, VPS36, which shows ubiquitin-binding activity and may form a putative ESCRT-II with VPS22 and VPS25 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Recessive mutation of the ubiquitously expressed <i>VPS36</i> causes multiple defects, including delayed embryogenesis, defective root elongation, and limited expansion of cotyledons, and these effects can be complemented by its genomic DNA. Abnormal intracellular compartments containing several membrane transporters, including members of the PIN-FORMEDs, AUXIN RESISTANT 1, and PIP1 families, were found in <i>vps36-1</i> plants. Employing a genetic approach to cross <i>vps36-1/+</i> with transgenic plants harboring various fluorescent protein-tagged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e markers, as well as fluorescent probe and ultrastructural approaches, revealed PM proteins in microsomal fractions from <i>vps36-1</i> seedlings and demonstrated that VPS36 is critical for forming multivesicular bodies and vacuolar biogenesis for protein degradation. Our study shows that functional VPS36 is essential for a proper endosomal sorting pathway and for vacuolar biogenesis in Arabidopsis.</p>

Control of Autophagy in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Is Mediated through Redox-Dependent Inactivation of the ATG4 Protease<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Autophagy is a major catabolic pathway by which eukaryotic cells deliver unnecessary or damaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic material to the vacuole for its degradation and recycling in order to maintain cellular homeostasis. Control of autophagy has been associated with the production of reactive oxygen species in several organisms, including plants and algae, but the precise regulatory molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the ATG4 protease, an essential protein for autophagosome biogenesis, plays a central role for the redox regulation of autophagy in the model green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Our results indicate that the activity of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> ATG4 is regulated by the formation of a single disulfide bond with a low redox potential that can be efficiently reduced by the NADPH/thioredoxin system. Moreover, we found that treatment of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cells with norflurazon, an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis that generates reactive oxygen species and triggers autophagy in this alga, promotes the oxidation and aggregation of ATG4. We propose that the activity of the ATG4 protease is finely regulated by the intracellular redox state, and it is inhibited under stress conditions to ensure lipidation of ATG8 and thus autophagy progression in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>.</p>

Two Chloroplast Proteins Suppress Drought Resistance by Affecting ROS Production in Guard Cells
<p>Chloroplast as the site for photosynthesis is an essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e in plants, but little is known about its role in stomatal regulation and drought resistance. In this study, we show that two chloroplastic proteins essential for thylakoid formation negatively regulate drought resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). By screening a mutant pool with T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes encoding chloroplastic proteins, we identified an <i>HCF106</i> knockdown mutant exhibiting increased resistance to drought stress. The <i>hcf106</i> mutant displayed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, improved stomatal closure, and reduced water loss under drought conditions. The HCF106 protein was found to physically interact with THF1, a previously identified chloroplastic protein crucial for thylakoid formation. The <i>thf1</i> mutant phenotypically resembled the <i>hcf106</i> mutant and displayed more ROS accumulation in guard cells, increased stomatal closure, reduced water loss, and drought resistant phenotypes compared to the wild type. The <i>hcf106thf1</i> double mutant behaved similarly as the <i>thf1</i> single mutant. These results suggest that HCF106 and THF1 form a complex to modulate chloroplast function and that the complex is important for ROS production in guard cells and stomatal control in response to environmental stresses. Our results also suggest that modulating chloroplastic proteins could be a way for improving drought resistance in crops.</p>

Hydrocarbons Are Essential for Optimal Cell Size, Division, and Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>Cyanobacteria are intricately organized, incorporating an array of internal thylakoid membranes, the site of photosynthesis, into cells no larger than other bacteria. They also synthesize C15-C19 alkanes and alkenes, which results in substantial production of hydrocarbons in the environment. All sequenced cyanobacteria encode hydrocarbon biosynthesis pathways, suggesting an important, undefined physiological role for these compounds. Here, we demonstrate that hydrocarbon-deficient mutants of <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 and <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 exhibit significant phenotypic differences from wild type, including enlarged cell size, reduced growth, and increased division defects. Photosynthetic rates were similar between strains, although a minor reduction in energy transfer between the soluble light harvesting phycobilisome complex and membrane-bound photosystems was observed. Hydrocarbons were shown to accumulate in thylakoid and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic membranes. Modeling of membranes suggests these compounds aggregate in the center of the lipid bilayer, potentially promoting membrane flexibility and facilitating curvature. In vivo measurements confirmed that <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 mutants lacking hydrocarbons exhibit reduced thylakoid membrane curvature compared to wild type. We propose that hydrocarbons may have a role in inducing the flexibility in membranes required for optimal cell division, size, and growth, and efficient association of soluble and membrane bound proteins. The recent identification of C15-C17 alkanes and alkenes in microalgal species suggests hydrocarbons may serve a similar function in a broad range of photosynthetic organisms.</p>

Periprosthetic femoral fractures and trying to avoid them
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Periprosthetic femoral fractures (PFF) following total hip arthroplasty   (THA) are devastating complications that are associated with functional   limitations and increased overall mortality. Although cementless   implants have been associated with an increased risk of PFF, the   precise contribution of implant geometry and design on the risk   of both intra-operative and post-operative PFF remains poorly investigated.   A systematic review was performed to aggregate all of the PFF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e   with specific attention to the femoral implant used.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A systematic search strategy of several journal databases and   recent proceedings from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons   was performed. Clinical articles were included for analysis if sufficient   implant description was provided. All articles were reviewed by   two reviewers. A review of fundamental investigations of implant   load-to-failure was performed, with the intent of identifying similar   conclusions from the clinical and fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total 596 articles were initially identified, with 34 being   eligible for analysis. Aggregate analysis of 1691 PFFs in 342 719   primary THAs revealed a significantly higher number of PFFs with   cementless femoral implants (p < 0.001). Single-wedge and double-wedge   (fit-and-fill) femoral implants were associated with a threefold   increase in PFF rates (p < 0.001) compared with anatomical, fully   coated and tapered/rounded stems. Within cemented stems, loaded-taper   (Exeter) stems were associated with more PFFs than composite-beam   (Charnley) stems (p = 0.004). Review of the fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e   revealed very few studies comparing cementless component designs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Very few studies within the PFF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e provide detailed implant   information. Cementless implants, specifically those of single-wedge   and double-wedge, have the highest PFF rates in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e,   with most investigations recommending against their use in older   patients with osteoporotic bone. This review illustrates the need   for registries and future PFF studies to record implant name and   information for future analysis. Furthermore, future biomechanical   investigations comparing modern implants are needed to clarify the   precise contribution of implant design to PFF risk.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):50–9.</p></sec>

Altered DNA Methylation of Long Noncoding RNA <i>H19</i> in Calcific Aortic Valve Disease Promotes Mineralization by Silencing <i>NOTCH1</i>
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Calcific aortic valve disease is characterized by an abnormal mineralization of the aortic valve. Osteogenic activity in the aortic valve is under the control of <i>NOTCH1</i>, which regulates the expression of key pro-osteogenic genes such as <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may reprogram cells by altering the gene expression pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Multidimensional genomic profiling was performed in human aortic valves to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> the expression of lncRNAs and the DNA methylation pattern in calcific aortic valve disease. In-depth functional assays were carried out to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> the impact of lncRNA on the mineralization of the aortic valve.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed that lncRNA <i>H19 (H19</i>) was increased in calcific aortic valve disease. Hypomethylation of the promoter region was observed in mineralized aortic valves and was inversely associated with <i>H19</i> expression. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that <i>H19</i> induces a strong osteogenic phenotype by altering the NOTCH1 pathway. Gene promoter analyses showed that <i>H19</i> silenced <i>NOTCH1</i> by preventing the recruitment of p53 to its promoter. A knockdown of <i>H19</i> in valve interstitial cells (VICs) increased the expression of <i>NOTCH1</i> and decreased the level of <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>, 2 downstream targets repressed by <i>NOTCH1</i>. In rescue experiments, the transfection of a vector encoding for the active Notch intracellular domain prevented <i>H19</i>-induced mineralization of valve interstitial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that a dysregulation of DNA methylation in the promoter of <i>H19</i> during calcific aortic valve disease is associated with a higher expression of this lncRNA, which promotes an osteogenic program by interfering with the expression of <i>NOTCH1.</i></p></sec>

Cardiovascular Health Promotion in Children: Challenges and Opportunities for 2020 and Beyond: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> provides a pediatric-focused companion to “Defining and Setting National Goals for Cardiovascular Health Promotion and Disease Reduction: The American Heart Association’s Strategic Impact Goal Through 2020 and Beyond,” focused on cardiovascular health promotion and disease reduction in adults and children. The principles detailed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> reflect the American Heart Association’s new dynamic and proactive goal to promote cardiovascular health throughout the life course. The primary focus is on adult cardiovascular health and disease prevention, but critical to achievement of this goal is maintenance of ideal cardiovascular health from birth through childhood to young adulthood and beyond. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles and metrics that define cardiovascular health in children for the clinical or research setting, and a balanced and critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the cardiovascular health construct in children and adolescents is provided. Specifically, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> discusses 2 important factors: the promotion of ideal cardiovascular health in all children and the improvement of cardiovascular health metric scores in children currently classified as having poor or intermediate cardiovascular health. Other topics include the current status of cardiovascular health in US children, opportunities for the refinement of health metrics, improvement of health metric scores, and possibilities for promoting ideal cardiovascular health. Importantly, concerns about the suitability of using single thresholds to identify elevated cardiovascular risk throughout the childhood years and the limits of our current knowledge are noted, and suggestions for future directions and research are provided.</p>

Tsunami-driven rafting: Transoceanic species dispersal and implications for marine biogeography
<p>The 2011 East Japan earthquake generated a massive tsunami that launched an extraordinary transoceanic biological rafting event with no known historical precedent. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> 289 living Japanese coastal marine species from 16 phyla transported over 6 years on objects that traveled thousands of kilometers across the Pacific Ocean to the shores of North America and Hawai‘i. Most of this dispersal occurred on nonbiodegradable objects, resulting in the longest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed transoceanic survival and dispersal of coastal species by rafting. Expanding shoreline infrastructure has increased global sources of plastic materials available for biotic colonization and also interacts with climate change–induced storms of increasing severity to eject debris into the oceans. In turn, increased ocean rafting may intensify species invasions.</p>

The effect of intravenous tranexamic acid on blood loss and early post-operative pain in total shoulder arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the impact of   intravenous tranexamic acid on the reduction of blood loss, transfusion   rate, and early post-operative clinical outcome in total shoulder   arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A randomised, placebo-controlled trial which included 54 patients   undergoing unilateral primary stemless anatomical or stemmed reverse   total shoulder arthroplasty was undertaken. Patients received either   100 ml saline (placebo, n = 27), or 100 ml saline together with   1000 mg of tranexamic acid (TXA, n = 27) intravenously prior to   skin incision and during wound closure. Peri-operative blood loss   via an intra-articular drain was recorded and total blood loss was   calculated. The post-operative transfusion rate was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed.   Assessment of early clinical parameters included the visual analogue   scale for pain (VAS), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ation of haematoma formation and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean peri-operative blood drainage (placebo: 170 ml <i>versus</i> TXA:   50 ml, p = 0.001) and calculated mean total blood loss (placebo:   1248.2 ml <i>versus</i> TXA: 871.0 ml, p = 0.009) were   significantly lower in the TXA group. No transfusions were necessary   during the study period in either group. Mean VAS for pain significantly   decreased from pre-operative (VAS 7) to the early post-operative   period (VAS 1.7, p < 0.001). Significant differences regarding   mean post-operative pain between placebo (VAS 2.0) and TXA (VAS   1.3) were detected (p = 0.05). The occurrence of haematomas was   significantly more frequent in the placebo (59.3%, n = 16) than   in the TXA group (25.9%, n = 6, p = 0.027).

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in skeletally immature patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Different methods of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction   have been described for skeletally immature patients before closure   of the growth plates. However, the outcome and complications following   this treatment remain unclear. The aim of this systematic review   was to analyse the outcome and complications of different techniques   which may be used for reconstruction of the ACL in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We performed a systematic review of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e according   to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines. This involved a comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline,   CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase and Google Scholar databases using the   following combinations of keywords, “knee”, “anterior cruciate ligament”,   “reconstruction”, “injury”, “children”, “adolescent”, “skeletally   immature”, “open physis” and “surgery”.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 53 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included   for analysis. The overall rate of disturbance of growth after ACL   reconstruction was 2.6%, with no statistical difference between   transphyseal and physeal-sparing techniques.

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteoarthritis   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Our aim was to   investigate the long-term outcome of a consecutive series of patients,   some of whom had anterior knee pain and PFJ OA managed with UKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We assessed the ten-year functional outcomes and 15-year implant   survival of 805 knees (677 patients) following medial mobile-bearing   UKA. The intra-operative status of the PFJ was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed and, with   the exception of bone loss with grooving to the lateral side, neither   the clinical or radiological state of the PFJ nor the presence of   anterior knee pain were considered a contraindication. The impact   of radiographic findings and anterior knee pain was studied in a   subgroup of 100 knees (91 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no relationship between functional outcomes, at a mean   of ten years, or 15-year implant survival, and pre-operative anterior   knee pain, or the presence or degree of cartilage loss <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed   intra-operatively at the medial patella or trochlea, or radiographic   evidence of OA in the medial side of the PFJ. In 6% of cases there   was full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral side of the patella.   In these cases, the overall ten-year function and 15-year survival   was similar to those without cartilage loss; however they had slightly   more difficulty with descending stairs. Radiographic signs of OA   seen in the lateral part of the PFJ were not associated with a definite   compromise in functional outcome or implant survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ with bone loss and   grooving remains a contraindication to mobile-bearing UKA. Less   severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ and damage to the medial   side, however severe, does not compromise the overall function or   survival, so should not be considered to be a contraindication. However,   if a patient does have full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral   side of the PFJ they may have a slight compromise in their ability   to descend stairs. Pre-operative anterior knee pain also does not   compromise the functional outcome or survival and should not be   considered to be a contraindication.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:632–9</p></sec>

Depression Treatment and 1-Year Mortality After Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Depression among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is prevalent and associated with an adverse quality of life and prognosis. Despite recommendations from some national organizations to screen for depression, it is unclear whether treatment of depression in patients with AMI is associated with better outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the prognosis of patients with treated versus untreated depression differs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients’ Health Status) is an observational multicenter cohort study that enrolled 4062 patients aged ≥18 years with AMI between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, from 24 US hospitals. Research coordinators administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the index AMI admission. Depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of ≥10. Depression was categorized as treated if there was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ation of a discharge diagnosis, medication prescribed for depression, or referral for counseling, and as untreated if none of these 3 criteria was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed in the medical records despite a PHQ score ≥10.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Fetal Cardiac Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The goal of this statement is to review available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e and to put forth a scientific statement on the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis and management of fetal cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association reviewed the available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e pertaining to topics relevant to fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and arrhythmias, assessment of cardiac function and the cardiovascular system, and available treatment options. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal diagnosis, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical management for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for diseases affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention strategies to prevent the progression of disease in utero are also discussed. Recommendations for delivery planning strategies for fetuses with congenital heart disease including models based on classification of disease severity and delivery room treatment will be highlighted.

The direct anterior approach in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The most effective surgical approach for total hip arthroplasty   (THA) remains controversial. The direct anterior approach may be   associated with a reduced risk of dislocation, faster recovery,   reduced pain and fewer surgical complications. This systematic review   aims to evaluate the current evidence for the use of this approach   in THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Following the Cochrane collaboration, an extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e   search of PubMed, Medline, Embase and OvidSP was conducted. Randomised   controlled trials, comparative studies, and cohort studies were   included. Outcomes included the length of the incision, blood loss,   operating time, length of stay, complications, and gait analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most were of   medium to low quality. There was no difference between the direct   anterior, anterolateral or posterior approaches with regards to   length of stay and gait analysis.</p><p>Papers comparing the length of the incision found similar lengths   compared with the lateral approach, and conflicting results when   comparing the direct anterior and posterior approaches. </p><p>Most studies found the mean operating time to be significantly   longer when the direct anterior approach was used, with a steep   learning curve reported by many.</p><p>Many authors used validated scores including the Harris hip score,   and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index.   These mean scores were better following the use of the direct anterior   approach for the first six weeks post-operatively. Subsequently   there was no difference between these scores and those for the posterior   approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>There is little evidence for improved kinematics or better long-term   outcomes following the use of the direct anterior approach for THA.   There is a steep learning curve with similar rates of complications,   length of stay and outcomes. </p><p>Well-designed, multi-centre, prospective randomised controlled   trials are required to provide evidence as to whether the direct   anterior approach is better than the lateral or posterior approaches   when undertaking THA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone JointJ</i> 2017;99-B:732–40.</p></sec>

Is there still a role for osteoarticular allograft reconstruction in musculoskeletal tumour surgery?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To assess complications and failure mechanisms of osteoarticular   allograft reconstructions for primary bone tumours.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively evaluated 38 patients (28 men, 74%) who were   treated at our institution with osteoarticular allograft reconstruction   between 1989 and 2010. Median age was 19 years (interquartile range   14 to 32). Median follow-up was 19.5 years (95% confidence interval   (CI) 13.0 to 26.1) when 26 patients (68%) were alive. In addition, we   systematically searched the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e for clinical studies on osteoarticular   allografts, finding 31 studies suitable for analysis. Results of   papers that reported on one site exclusively were pooled for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 20 patients (53%) experienced graft failure, including   15 due to mechanical complications (39%) and three (9%) due to infection.   In the systematic review, 514 reconstructions were analysed (distal   femur, n = 184, 36%; proximal tibia, n = 136, 26%; distal radius,   n = 99, 19%; proximal humerus, n = 95, 18%). Overall rates of failure, fracture   and infection were 27%, 20%, and 10% respectively. With the distal   femur as the reference, fractures were more common in the humerus   (odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95% CI 2.2 to 7.7) and tibia (OR 2.2, 95%   CI 1.3 to 4.4); infections occurred more often in the tibia (OR   2.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.4) and less often in the radius (OR 0.1, 95%   CI 0.0 to 0.8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Osteoarticular allograft reconstructions are associated with   high rates of mechanical complications. Although comparative studies   with alternative techniques are scarce, the risk of mechanical failure   in our opinion does not justify routine employment of osteoarticular   allografts for reconstruction of large joints after tumour resection.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:522–30.</p></sec>

Post-operative neuropathy after total hip arthroplasty
<p>Nerve palsy is a well-described complication   following total hip arthroplasty, but is highly distressing and   disabling. A nerve palsy may cause difficulty with the post-operative   rehabilitation, and overall mobility of the patient. Nerve palsy   may result from compression and tension to the affected nerve(s)   during the course of the operation via surgical manipulation and   retractor placement, tension from limb lengthening or compression   from post-operative hematoma. In the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e, hip dysplasia,   lengthening of the leg, the use of an uncemented femoral component, and   female gender are associated with a greater risk of nerve palsy.   We examined our experience at a high-volume, tertiary care referral   centre, and found an overall incidence of 0.3% out of 39 056 primary   hip arthroplasties. Risk factors found to be associated with the   incidence of nerve palsy at our institution included the presence   of spinal stenosis or lumbar disc disease, age younger than 50,   and smoking. If a nerve palsy is diagnosed, imaging is mandatory   and surgical evacuation or compressive haematomas may be beneficial.   As palsies are slow to recover, supportive care such as bracing,   therapy, and reassurance are the mainstays of treatment.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):46–9.</p>

Obesity in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of our study is to summarise the current scientific   findings regarding the impact of obesity on total hip arthroplasty   (THA); specifically the influence of obesity on the timing of THA,   incidence of complications, and effect on clinical and functional   outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We performed a systematic review that was compliant with the   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines to identify prospective studies from the PubMed/Medline,   Embase, and Cochrane Library databases that evaluated primary THA   in obese (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 17 articles included in the review, which encompassed   13 722 THA patients. Analysis of the included studies showed that,   when compared with non-obese patients, obesity was associated with   younger age at time of primary THA, and an increased incidence of   complications (up to four-fold). Results were mixed on the influence   of obesity on the outcomes of primary THA, with three studies showing   a detrimental effect on outcomes of a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>,   while eight studies showed no effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Obesity is associated with significantly younger age at time   of primary THA and obese patients are likely to experience a higher   rate of peri-operative complications.

Dislocation following total hip arthroplasty using dual mobility acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this systematic review was to report the rate of dislocation   following the use of dual mobility (DM) acetabular components in   primary and revision total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines   was performed. A comprehensive search of Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane   Library and Embase (Scopus) was conducted for English articles between   January 1974 and March 2016 using various combinations of the keywords “dual   mobility”, “dual-mobility”, “tripolar”, “double-mobility”, “double   mobility”, “hip”, “cup”, “socket”. The following data were extracted   by two investigators independently: demographics, whether the operation   was a primary or revision THA, length of follow-up, the design of   the components, diameter of the femoral head, and type of fixation   of the acetabular component.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 59 articles met our inclusion criteria. These included   a total of 17 908 THAs which were divided into two groups: studies   dealing with DM components in primary THA and those dealing with   these components in revision THA. The mean rate of dislocation was   0.9% in the primary THA group, and 3.0% in the revision THA group.   The mean rate of intraprosthetic dislocation was 0.7% in primary   and 1.3% in revision THAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the current data, the use of DM acetabular components   are effective in minimising the risk of instability after both primary   and revision THA. This benefit must be balanced against continuing   concerns about the additional modularity, and the new mode of failure   of intraprosthetic dislocation. Longer term studies are needed to   assess the function of these newer materials compared with previous   generations. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1   Supple A):18–24.</p></sec>

Minimally invasive periacetabular osteotomy using a modified Smith-Petersen approach
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Periacetabular osteotomy is an effective way of treating symptomatic   hip dysplasia. We describe a new minimally invasive technique using   a modification of the Smith-Peterson approach.</p><p>We performed a prospective, longitudinal cohort study to assess   for any compromise in acetabular correction when using this approach,   and to see if the procedure would have a higher complication rate   than that quoted in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e for other approaches. We also   assessed for any improvement in functional outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>From 168 consecutive patients (189 hips) who underwent acetabular   correction between March 2010 and March 2013 we excluded those who   had undergone previous pelvic surgery for DDH and those being treated   for acetabular retroversion. The remaining 151 patients (15 men,   136 women) (166 hips) had a mean age of 32 years (15 to 56) and the   mean duration of follow-up was 2.8 years (1.2 to 4.5). In all 90%   of cases were Tönnis grade 0 or 1. Functional outcomes were assessed   using the Non Arthritic Hip Score (NAHS), University of California,   Los Angeles (UCLA) and Tegner activity scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean pre-operative lateral centre-edge angle was 14.2° (-5°   to 30°) and the mean acetabular index was 18.4° (4° to 40°). Post-operatively   these were 31° (18° to 46°) and 3° (-7° to 29°), respectively, a   significant improvement in both (p < 0.001). Allogenic blood   transfusion was required in two patients (1.2%). There were no major   nerve or vascular complications, and no wound infections. At the   time of last follow-up, we noted a significant improvement in functional   outcome scores: UCLA improved by 2.31 points, Tegner improved by   1.08 points, and the NAHS improved by 25.4 points (p < 0.001   for each). Hypermobility and longer duration of surgery were significant   negative predictors for a good post-operative UCLA score, while   residual retroversion was a positive predictor of post-operative   UCLA score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found this approach to be safe and effective, facilitating   early recovery from surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:22–8.</p></sec>

Instability of the hip after anatomical  re-alignment in patients with a slipped capital femoral epiphysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Several studies have reported the safety and efficacy of subcapital   re-alignment for patients with slipped capital femoral epiphysis   (SCFE) using surgical dislocation of the hip and an extended retinacular   flap. Instability of the hip and dislocation as a consequence of   this surgery has only recently gained attention.

Unconstrained metacarpophalangeal joint arthroplasties
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We performed a systematic review of the current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e regarding   the outcomes of unconstrained metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We initially identified 1305 studies, and 406 were found to be   duplicates. After exclusion criteria were applied, seven studies   were included. Outcomes extracted included pre- and post-operative   pain visual analogue scores, range of movement (ROM), strength of   pinch and grip, satisfaction and patient reported outcome measures   (PROMs). Clinical and radiological complications were recorded.   The results are presented in three groups based on the design of   the arthroplasty and the aetiology (pyrocarbon-osteoarthritis (pyro-OA),   pyrocarbon-inflammatory arthritis (pyro-IA), metal-on-polyethylene   (MoP)).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Results show that pyrocarbon implants provide an 85% reduction   in pain, 144% increase of pinch grip and 13° improvements in ROM   for both OA and IA combined. Patients receiving MoP arthroplasties   had a reduction in pinch strength. Satisfaction rates were 91% and   92% for pyrocarbon-OA and pyrocarbon-IA groups, respectively. There were   nine failures in 87 joints (10.3%) over a mean follow-up of 5.5   years (1.0 to 14.3) for pyro-OA. There were 18 failures in 149 joints   (12.1%) over a mean period of 6.6 years (1.0 to 16.0) for pyro-IA.   Meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of the studies   and the limited presentation of data.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We would recommend prospective data collection for small joint   arthroplasties of the hand consisting of PROMs that would allow   clinicians to come to stronger conclusions about the impact on function   of replacing the MCPJs.

Complications following arthroscopic surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery of the   hip has increased significantly during the past decade. It has now   become an established technique for the treatment of many intra-   and extra-articular conditions affecting the hip. However, it has   a steep learning curve and is not without the risk of complications.   The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence   of complications during and following this procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines were used in designing this study. Two reviewers systematically   searched the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e for complications related to arthroscopy   of the hip. The research question and eligibility criteria were   established <i>a priori</i>. Pertinent data were abstracted   and analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found 276 relevant studies with a total of 36 761 arthroscopies   that met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was   36.7 years (1.7 to 70) and the mean body mass index was 25.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (20.2   to 29.2). Femoroacetabular impingement and labral tears were the   most common indications for the procedure. The total number of complications   was 1222 (3.3%). Nerve injury (0.9%), mainly involving the pudendal   and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves, and iatrogenic chondral and   labral injury (0.7%), were the two most common complications. There   were 58 major complications (0.2%), the most common being intra-abdominal   extravasation of fluid, which was found in 13 cases (0.04%). There   were three deaths (0.008%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Arthroscopic surgery of the hip is a procedure with a relatively   low rate of complications, although some may be significant in this   young cohort of patients.

What is the morbidity of a non-invasive growing prosthesis?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Extendible endoprostheses have been available for more than 30   years and have become more sophisticated with time. The latest generation   is ‘non-invasive’ and can be lengthened with an external magnetic   force. Early results have shown a worryingly high rate of complications   such as infection. This study investigates the incidence of complications   and the need for further surgery in a cohort of patients with a   non-invasive growing endoprosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2003 and June 2014, 50 children (51 prostheses) had a   non-invasive growing prosthesis implanted for a primary bone sarcoma.   The minimum follow-up was 24 months for those who survived. Their   mean age was 10.4 years (6 to 14). The incidence of complications   and further surgery was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 64 months (20 to 145). The overall survivorship   of the patients was 84% at three years and 70% at five years. Revision-free   survival was 81.7% at three years and 61.6% at five years with competing   risk analysis. Deep infection occurred in 19.6% of implants at a   mean of 12.5 months (0 to 55). Other complications were a failure   of the lengthening mechanism in five prostheses (9.8%) and breakage   of the implant in two (3.9%). Overall, there were 53 additional   operations (0 to 5 per patient). A total of seven patients (14%)   underwent amputation, three for local recurrence and four for infection.   Their mean limb length discrepancy was 4.3 mm (0 to 25) and mean Musculoskeletal   Tumor Society Score functional score was 26.5 (18 to 30) at the   final follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>When compared with previously published early results, this mid-term   series has shown continued good functional outcomes and compensation   for leg-length discrepancy.

A case–control study of surgical site infection following operative fixation of fractures of the ankle in a large UK trauma unit
<p>Most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e on surgical site infections   following the surgical treatment of fractures of the ankle is based   on small series of patients, focusing on diabetics or the elderly.   None have described post-operative functional scores in those patients   who develop an infection. We performed an age- and gender-matched   case–control study to identify patient- and surgery-related risk   factors for surgical site infection following open reduction and   internal fixation of a fracture of the ankle. Logistic regression   analysis was used to identify significant risk factors for infection   and to calculate odds ratios (OR). Function was assessed using the   Olerud and Molander Ankle Score. The incidence of infection was   4% (29/717) and 1.1% (8/717) were deep infections. The median ankle   score was significantly lower in the infection group compared with   the control group (60 <i>vs</i> 90, Mann–Whitney test   p < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that diabetes   (OR = 15, p = 0.031), nursing home residence (OR = 12, p = 0.018)   and Weber C fractures (OR = 4, p = 0.048) were significant risk   factors for infection.</p><p>A low incidence of infection following open reduction and internal   fixation of fractures of the ankle was observed. Both superficial   and deep infections result in lower functional scores.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:636–40.</p>

Degenerative subtalar joints complicated by medial plantar intraneural cysts
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The pathogenesis of intraneural ganglion cysts is controversial.   Recent reports in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e described medial plantar intraneural   ganglion cysts (mIGC) with articular branches to subtalar joints.   The aim of the current study was to provide further support for   the principles underlying the articular theory, and to explain the   successes and failures of treatment of mICGs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2006 and 2017, five patients with five mICGs were retrospectively   reviewed. There were five men with a mean age of 50.2 years (33   to 68) and a mean follow-up of 3.8 years (0.8 to 6). Case history,   physical examination, imaging, and intraoperative findings were   reviewed. The outcomes of interest were ultrasound and/or MRI features   of mICG, as well as the clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The five intraneural cysts followed the principles of the unifying   articular theory. Connection to the posterior subtalar joint (pSTJ)   was identified or suspected in four patients. Re-evaluation of preoperative   MRI demonstrated a degenerative pSTJ and denervation changes in   the abductor hallucis in all patients. Cyst excision with resection   of the articular branch (four), cyst incision and drainage (one),   and percutaneous aspiration/steroid injection (two) were performed.   Removing the connection to the pSTJ prevented recurrence of mIGC,   whereas medial plantar nerves remained cystic and symptomatic when   resection of the communicating articular branch was not performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings support a standardized treatment algorithm for mIGC   in the presence of degenerative disease at the pSTJ. By understanding   the pathoanatomic mechanism for every cyst, we can improve treatment   that must address the articular branch to avoid the recurrence of   intraneural ganglion cysts, as well as the degenerative pSTJ to   avoid extraneural cyst formation or recurrence.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:183–9.</p></sec>

Reconstruction of the hip after resection of periacetabular oncological lesions
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Reconstruction of the acetabulum after resection of a periacetabular   malignancy is technically challenging and many different techniques   have been used with varying success. Our aim was to prepare a systematic   review of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e dealing with these techniques in order   to clarify the management, the rate of complications and the outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A search of PubMed and MEDLINE was conducted for English language   articles published between January 1990 and February 2017 with combinations   of key search terms to identify studies dealing with periacetabular   resection with reconstruction in patients with a malignancy. Studies   in English that reported radiographic or clinical outcomes were   included. Data collected from each study included: the number and   type of reconstructions, the pathological diagnosis of the lesions,   the mean age and follow-up, gender distribution, implant survivorship, complications,   functional outcome, and mortality. The results from individual studies   were combined for the general analysis, and then grouped according   to the type of reconstruction. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 57 studies met the inclusion criteria and included   1700 patients. Most lesions were metastatic (41%), followed by chondrosarcoma   (29%), osteosarcoma (10%), Ewing’s sarcoma (7%), and multiple myeloma   (2%). The techniques of reconstruction were divided into seven types   for analysis: those involving a Harrington reconstruction, a saddle   prosthesis, an allograft and allograft prosthesis composite, a pasteurised   autograft, a porous tantalum implant, a custom-made prosthesis and   a modular hemipelvic reconstruction. The rate of complications was   50%, with infection (14%) and instability (8%) being the most common.   Mortality data were available for 1427 patients (84%); 50% had died   of disease progression, 23% were alive with disease, and 27% had no   evidence of disease at a mean follow-up of 3.4 years (0 to 34). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both the rate of complications and mortality are high following   resection of oncological periacetabular lesions and reconstruction.

A pilot randomized trial of meniscal allograft transplantation versus personalized physiotherapy for patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee compartment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Meniscal allograft transplantation is undertaken to improve pain   and function in patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee   compartment. While case series have shown improvements in patient   reported outcome measures (PROMs), its efficacy has not been rigorously   evaluated. This study aimed to compare PROMs in patients having   meniscal transplantation with those having personalized physiotherapy   at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single-centre assessor-blinded, comprehensive cohort study,   incorporating a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed   on patients with a symptomatic compartment of the knee in which   a (sub)total meniscectomy had previously been performed. They were   randomized to be treated either with a meniscal allograft transplantation   or personalized physiotherapy, and stratified for malalignment of   the limb. They entered the preference groups if they were not willing   to be randomized. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS),   International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Lysholm   score and complications were collected at baseline and at four,   eight and 12 months following the interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 patients entered the study; 21 were randomized   and 15 chose their treatments. Their mean age was 28 years (range   17 to 46). The outcomes were similar in the randomized and preference   groups, allowing pooling of data. At 12 months, the KOOS<sub>4</sub> composite   score (mean difference 12, p = 0.03) and KOOS subscales of pain   (mean difference 15, p = 0.02) and activities of daily living (mean   difference 18, p = 0.005) were significantly superior in the meniscal   transplantation group. Other PROMs also favoured this group without   reaching statistical significance. There were five complications   in the meniscal transplantation and one in the physiotherapy groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to compare meniscal allograft transplantation   to non-operative treatment.

Absence of strong strain effects in behavioral analyses of <i>Shank3</i>-deficient mice
<p>Haploinsufficiency of <i>SHANK3</i>, caused by chromosomal abnormalities or mutations that disrupt one copy of the gene, leads to a neurodevelopmental syndrome called Phelan-McDermid syndrome, symptoms of which can include absent or delayed speech, intellectual disability, neurological changes and autism spectrum disorders. The SHANK3 protein forms a key structural part of the post-synaptic density. We previously generated and characterized mice with a targeted disruption of <i>Shank3</i> in which exons coding for the ankyrin-repeat domain were deleted and expression of full-length Shank3 was disrupted. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed specific deficits in synaptic function and plasticity, along with reduced reciprocal social interactions, in <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous mice. Changes in phenotype owing to a mutation at a single locus are quite frequently modulated by other loci, most dramatically when the entire genetic background is changed. In mice, each strain of laboratory mouse represents a distinct genetic background and alterations in phenotype owing to gene knockout or transgenesis are frequently different across strains, which can lead to the identification of important modifier loci. We have investigated the effect of genetic background on phenotypes of <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous, knockout and wild-type mice, using C57BL/6, 129SVE and FVB/Ntac strain backgrounds. We focused on observable behaviors with the goal of carrying out subsequent analyses to identify modifier loci. Surprisingly, there were very modest strain effects over a large battery of analyses. These results indicate that behavioral phenotypes associated with <i>Shank3</i> haploinsufficiency are largely strain-independent.</p>

Behavioral abnormalities and Parkinson’s-like histological changes resulting from <i>Id2</i> inactivation in mice
<p>Characterizing dopaminergic neuronal development and function in novel genetic animal models might uncover strategies for researchers to develop disease-modifying treatments for neurologic disorders. <i>Id2</i> is a transcription factor expressed in the developing central nervous system. <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice have fewer dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb and reduced olfactory discrimination, a pre-clinical marker of Parkinson’s disease. Here, we summarize behavioral, histological and <i>in vitro</i> molecular biological analyses to determine whether midbrain dopaminergic neurons are affected by <i>Id2</i> loss. <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice were hyperactive at 1 and 3 months of age, but by 6 months showed reduced activity. <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed age-dependent histological alterations in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpC) associated with changes in locomotor activity. Reduced dopamine transporter (<i>DAT)</i> expression was observed at early ages in <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice and <i>DAT</i> expression was dependent on <i>Id2</i> expression in an <i>in vitro</i> dopaminergic differentiation model. Evidence of neurodegeneration, including activated caspase-3 and glial infiltration, were noted in the SNpC of older <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice. These findings <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> a novel role for <i>Id2</i> in the maintenance of midbrain dopamine neurons. The <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mouse should provide unique opportunities to study the progression of neurodegenerative disorders involving the dopamine system.</p>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect development has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan development. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic development of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head development. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, developed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> development. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

<i>De novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing mouse embryos originating from enucleolated zygotes
<p>The large, compact oocyte nucleoli, sometimes referred to as nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs), are essential for embryonic development in mammals; in their absence, the oocytes complete maturation and can be fertilized, but no nucleoli are formed in the zygote or embryo, leading to developmental failure. It has been convincingly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed that zygotes inherit the oocyte nucleolar material and form NPBs again in pronuclei. It is commonly accepted that during early embryonic development, the original compact zygote NPBs gradually transform into reticulated nucleoli of somatic cells. Here, we show that zygote NPBs are not required for embryonic and full-term development in the mouse. When NPBs were removed from late-stage zygotes by micromanipulation, the enucleolated zygotes developed to the blastocyst stage and, after transfer to recipients, live pups were obtained. We also describe <i>de novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing embryos. After removal of NPBs from zygotes, they formed new nucleoli after several divisions. These results indicate that the zygote NPBs are not used in embryonic development and that the nucleoli in developing embryos originate from <i>de novo</i> synthesized materials.</p>

ICare-ACS (Improving Care Processes for Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to safely reduce length of stay for emergency department patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have had mixed success. Few system-wide efforts affecting multiple hospital emergency departments have ever been evaluated. We evaluated the effectiveness of a nationwide implementation of clinical pathways for potential ACS in disparate hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter pragmatic stepped-wedge before-and-after trial in 7 New Zealand acute care hospitals with 31 332 patients investigated for suspected ACS with serial troponin measurements. The implementation was a clinical pathway for the assessment of patients with suspected ACS that included a clinical pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> in paper or electronic format, structured risk stratification, specified time points for electrocardiographic and serial troponin testing within 3 hours of arrival, and directions for combining risk stratification and electrocardiographic and troponin testing in an accelerated diagnostic protocol. Implementation was monitored for >4 months and compared with usual care over the preceding 6 months. The main outcome measure was the odds of discharge within 6 hours of presentation</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 11 529 participants in the preimplementation phase (range, 284–3465) and 19 803 in the postimplementation phase (range, 395–5039). Overall, the mean 6-hour discharge rate increased from 8.3% (range, 2.7%–37.7%) to 18.4% (6.8%–43.8%). The odds of being discharged within 6 hours increased after clinical pathway implementation. The odds ratio was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.3–2.6). In patients without ACS, the median length of hospital stays decreased by 2.9 hours (95% confidence interval, 2.4–3.4). For patients discharged within 6 hours, there was no change in 30-day major adverse cardiac event rates (0.52% versus 0.44%; <i>P</i>=0.96). In these patients, no adverse event occurred when clinical pathways were correctly followed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of clinical pathways for suspected ACS reduced the length of stay and increased the proportions of patients safely discharged within 6 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.anzctr.org.au/</ext-link> (Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry).

Proteomic Architecture of Human Coronary and Aortic Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Backgound:</title><p>The inability to detect premature atherosclerosis significantly hinders implementation of personalized therapy to prevent coronary heart disease. A comprehensive understanding of arterial protein networks and how they change in early atherosclerosis could identify new biomarkers for disease detection and improved therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here we describe the human arterial proteome and proteomic features strongly associated with early atherosclerosis based on mass spectrometry analysis of coronary artery and aortic specimens from 100 autopsied young adults (200 arterial specimens). Convex analysis of mixtures, differential dependent network modeling, and bioinformatic analyses defined the composition, network rewiring, and likely regulatory features of the protein networks associated with early atherosclerosis and how they vary across 2 anatomic distributions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> significant differences in mitochondrial protein abundance between coronary and aortic samples (coronary>>aortic), and between atherosclerotic and normal tissues (atherosclerotic<<normal), and major alterations in tumor necrosis factor, insulin receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ protein networks, as well, in the setting of early disease. In addition, a subset of tissue protein biomarkers indicative of early atherosclerosis was shown to predict anatomically defined coronary atherosclerosis when measured in plasma samples in a separate clinical cohort (area under the curve=0.92 [0.83–0.96]), thereby validating the use of human tissue proteomics to discover relevant plasma biomarkers for clinical applications. In addition to the specific proteins and pathways identified here, the publicly available data resource and the analysis pipeline used illustrate a strategy for interrogating and interpreting the proteomic architecture of tissues that may be relevant for other chronic diseases characterized by multicellular tissue phenotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The human arterial proteome can be viewed as a complex network whose architectural features vary considerably as a function of anatomic location and the presence or absence of atherosclerosis. The data suggest important reductions in mitochondrial protein abundance in early atherosclerosis and also identify a subset of plasma proteins that are highly predictive of angiographically defined coronary disease.</p></sec>

Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Coronary Artery Calcium, and Cardiovascular Disease Events in a Cohort of Generally Healthy Middle-Age Men
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e demonstrates that coronary artery calcification (CAC) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are independent predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Much less is known about the joint associations of CRF and CAC with CVD risk. In the setting of high CAC, high versus low CRF has been associated with decreased CVD events. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of continuous levels of CRF on CVD risk in the setting of increasing CAC burden.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 8425 men without clinical CVD who underwent preventive medicine examinations that included an objective measurement of CRF and CAC between 1998 and 2007. There were 383 CVD events during an average follow-up of 8.4 years. Parametric proportional hazards regression models based on a Gompertz mortality rule were used to estimate total CVD incidence rates at 70 years of age as well as hazard ratios for the included covariates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CVD events increased with increasing CAC and decreased with increasing CRF. Adjusting for CAC level (scores of 0, 1–99, 100–399, and ≥400), for each additional MET of fitness, there was an 11% lower risk for CVD events (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.94). When CAC and CRF were considered together, there was a strong association between continuous CRF and CVD incidence rates in all CAC groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In a large cohort of generally healthy men, there is an attenuation of CVD risk at all CAC levels with higher CRF.</p></sec>

We measured cumulative numbers of LDIR-related cardiac procedures for each patient until 1 year before the time of cancer diagnosis or administrative censoring. To assess the association between LDIR exposure and cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study and matched cancer cases with controls on sex, CHD severity, birth year, and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study included 24 833 adult patients with CHD aged 18 to 64 years from 1995 to 2009. In >250 791 person-years of follow-up, 602 cancer cases were observed (median age, 55.4 years). The cumulative incidence of cancer estimated up to 64 years of age was 15.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.2–16.5). Cases had more LDIR-related cardiac procedures than controls (1410 versus 921 per 1000 adult patients with CHD, <i>P</i><0.0001). Cumulative LDIR exposure was independently associated with cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13). Similar results were obtained by using dose estimates for LDIR exposure (OR, 1.10 per 10 mSv; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15) with a possible dose-related response. The effect measure was in the same direction, and the association was persistent for exposure from ≥6 procedures in all sensitivity analyses: after excluding most smoking-related cancer cases (OR, 1.10 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.05–1.16 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.77–5.37), and after applying a 3-year lag period (OR, 1.09 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.03–1.14 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures: 2.58; 95% CI, 1.43–4.69).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based study to analyze and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> the association between LDIR-related cardiac procedures and incident cancer in the population of adults with CHD. Confirmations of these findings by prospective studies are needed to reinforce policy recommendations for radiation surveillance in patients with CHD where no regulation currently exists. Physicians ordering and performing cardiac imaging should ensure that exposure is as low as reasonably achievable without sacrificing quality of care.</p></sec>

Efficacy and Safety of the Use of Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Concomitant Aspirin Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current guidelines recommend non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) as the first-choice therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation because these drugs have several benefits over the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). It is unknown whether these benefits remain when NOACs have to be combined with aspirin therapy. To assess the efficacy and safety of NOACs compared with VKAs in patients with atrial fibrillation and concomitant aspirin therapy, we conducted a systematic review and study–based meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e search was done in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials for studies including published data of patients ≥18 years of age with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, randomized to either VKAs or NOACs, or receiving aspirin therapy at any time during the study that report all-cause stroke or systemic embolism, vascular death, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, or intracranial hemorrhage as an outcome. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome were extracted from the individual studies and pooled with random-effects meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>This study-based meta-analysis was restricted to the subgroups of patients on aspirin therapy (n=21 722) from 4 randomized controlled trials comparing VKAs and NOACs (n=71 681) in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. In this meta-analysis including patients on mainly low-dose aspirin, NOACs were found to be more effective (outcome of stroke or systemic embolism: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67–0.91; vascular death: HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.93) and as safe as VKAs with respect to major bleeding (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69–1.01). NOACs were safer with respect to the reduction of intracranial hemorrhage (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26–0.56).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study-based meta-analysis shows that it may be both safer and more effective to use NOACs compared with VKAs to treat patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and concomitant aspirin therapy.</p></sec>

Dedifferentiation, Proliferation, and Redifferentiation of Adult Mammalian Cardiomyocytes After Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Adult mammalian hearts have a limited ability to generate new cardiomyocytes. Proliferation of existing adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs) is a potential source of new cardiomyocytes. Understanding the fundamental biology of ACM proliferation could be of great clinical significance for treating myocardial infarction (MI). We aim to understand the process and regulation of ACM proliferation and its role in new cardiomyocyte formation of post-MI mouse hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>β-Actin-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice and fate-mapping Myh6-MerCreMer-tdTomato/lacZ mice were used to trace the fate of ACMs. In a coculture system with neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, ACM proliferation was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed with clear evidence of cytokinesis observed with time-lapse imaging. Cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult mouse post-MI heart was detected by cell cycle markers and 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine incorporation analysis. Echocardiography was used to measure cardiac function, and histology was performed to determine infarction size.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vitro, mononucleated and bi/multinucleated ACMs were able to proliferate at a similar rate (7.0%) in the coculture. Dedifferentiation proceeded ACM proliferation, which was followed by redifferentiation. Redifferentiation was essential to endow the daughter cells with cardiomyocyte contractile function. Intercellular propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from contracting neonatal rat ventricular myocytes into ACM daughter cells was required to activate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cell signaling pathway to induce ACM redifferentiation. The properties of neonatal rat ventricular myocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients influenced the rate of ACM redifferentiation. Hypoxia impaired the function of gap junctions by dephosphorylating its component protein connexin 43, the major mediator of intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation between cardiomyocytes, thereby impairing ACM redifferentiation. In vivo, ACM proliferation was found primarily in the MI border zone. An ischemia-resistant connexin 43 mutant enhanced the redifferentiation of ACM-derived new cardiomyocytes after MI and improved cardiac function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Mature ACMs can reenter the cell cycle and form new cardiomyocytes through a 3-step process: dedifferentiation, proliferation, and redifferentiation. Intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal from neighboring functioning cardiomyocytes through gap junctions induces the redifferentiation process. This novel mechanism contributes to new cardiomyocyte formation in post-MI hearts in mammals.</p></sec>

Prevalence, Incidence, and Mortality of Stroke in China
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>China bears the biggest stroke burden in the world. However, little is known about the current prevalence, incidence, and mortality of stroke at the national level, and the trend in the past 30 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 2013, a nationally representative door-to-door survey was conducted in 155 urban and rural centers in 31 provinces in China, totaling 480 687 adults aged ≥20 years. All stroke survivors were considered as prevalent stroke cases at the prevalent time (August 31, 2013). First-ever strokes that occurred during 1 year preceding the survey point-prevalent time were considered as incident cases. According to computed tomography/MRI/autopsy findings, strokes were categorized into ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke of undetermined type.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 480 687 participants, 7672 were diagnosed with a prevalent stroke (1596.0/100 000 people) and 1643 with incident strokes (345.1/100 000 person-years). The age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates were 1114.8/100 000 people, 246.8 and 114.8/100 000 person-years, respectively. Pathological type of stroke was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed by computed tomography/MRI brain scanning in 90% of prevalent and 83% of incident stroke cases. Among incident and prevalent strokes, ischemic stroke constituted 69.6% and 77.8%, intracerebral hemorrhage 23.8% and 15.8%, subarachnoid hemorrhage 4.4% and 4.4%, and undetermined type 2.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Age-specific stroke prevalence in men aged ≥40 years was significantly greater than the prevalence in women (<i>P</i><0.001). The most prevalent risk factors among stroke survivors were hypertension (88%), smoking (48%), and alcohol use (44%). Stroke prevalence estimates in 2013 were statistically greater than those reported in China 3 decades ago, especially among rural residents (<i>P</i>=0.017). The highest annual incidence and mortality of stroke was in Northeast (365 and 159/100 000 person-years), then Central areas (326 and 154/100 000 person-years), and the lowest incidence was in Southwest China (154/100 000 person-years), and the lowest mortality was in South China (65/100 000 person-years) (<i>P</i><0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Stroke burden in China has increased over the past 30 years, and remains particularly high in rural areas. There is a north-to-south gradient in stroke in China, with the greatest stroke burden observed in the northern and central regions.</p></sec>

Plasma Ceramides, Mediterranean Diet, and Incident Cardiovascular Disease in the PREDIMED Trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although in vitro studies and investigations in animal models and small clinical populations have suggested that ceramides may represent an intermediate link between overnutrition and certain pathological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD), no prospective studies have investigated the association between plasma ceramides and risk of CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population consisted of 980 participants from the PREDIMED trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea), including 230 incident cases of CVD and 787 randomly selected participants at baseline (including 37 overlapping cases) followed for ≤7.4 years. Participants were randomized to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts, or a control diet. Plasma ceramide concentrations were measured on a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics platform. The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Hazard ratios were estimated with weighted Cox regression models using Barlow weights to account for the case-cohort design.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The multivariable hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the extreme quartiles of plasma concentrations of C16:0, C22:0, C24:0, and C24:1 ceramides were 2.39 (1.49–3.83, <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.001), 1.91 (1.21–3.01, <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.003), 1.97 (1.21–3.20, <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.004), and 1.73 (1.09–2.74, <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.011), respectively. The ceramide score, calculated as a weighted sum of concentrations of four ceramides, was associated with a 2.18-fold higher risk of CVD across extreme quartiles (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.36–3.49; <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.001). The association between baseline ceramide score and incident CVD varied significantly by treatment groups (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.010). Participants with a higher ceramide score and assigned to either of the 2 active intervention arms of the trial showed similar CVD risk to those with a lower ceramide score, whereas participants with a higher ceramide score and assigned to the control arm presented significantly higher CVD risk. Changes in ceramide concentration were not significantly different between Mediterranean diet and control groups during the first year of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed a novel positive association between baseline plasma ceramide concentrations and incident CVD.

Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is a rare form of congenital heart disease. This study describes current surgical treatment strategies and experiences in a cohort of patients from 2 congenital cardiac centers in Shanghai and Guangdong in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This retrospective study included 768 patients operated on between 2005 and 2014. Although most patients (n=690) underwent conventional repair, a sutureless technique was used in 10% (n=78) of cases. A multilevel mixed-effects parametric survival model and a competing-risk analysis were used to analyze associated risk factors for death and recurrent pulmonary venous obstruction (PVO), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze the overall survival. The Nelson-Aalen cumulative risk curve was used to compare distributions of time with recurrent PVO.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean surgical age and weight were 214.9±39.2 days and 5.4±3.6 kg, respectively. Obstructed TAPVC (PVO) was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed in 192 (25%) of the 768 patients. There were 38 intraoperative deaths and 13 late deaths. A younger age at the time of repair (<i>P</i>=0.001), mixed (<i>P</i>=0.004) and infracardiac (<i>P</i>=0.035) TAPVC, preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.027), prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001), and longer duration of ventilation (<i>P</i>=0.028) were associated with mortality. The median follow-up was 23.2 months (range; 1–112 months). Among the 717 survivors, recurrent PVO was observed in 111 patients (15%). Associated risk factors for recurrent PVO included preoperative PVO (<i>P</i><0.001), infracardiac TAPVC (<i>P</i><0.001), mixed TAPVC (<i>P</i>=0.013), and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001). Sutureless technique was associated with a lower restenosis rate compared with conventional repair in patients with preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.038), except in newborn patients (<i>P</i>=0.443). Reintervention for restenosis was performed in 24 patients. The function of most survivors (91%) was classified according to the New York Heart Association as functional class I or II.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Surgical correction in patients with TAPVC with a biventricular anatomy can achieve an acceptable outcome. Risk factors such as a younger age at the time of repair, infracardiac and mixed TAPVC, and preoperative PVO were associated with a poorer prognosis.</p></sec>

All data are self-reported, and all participating centers have committed to support their consecutive experience with the SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve, dependent on patient consent, before the start of the study. Adverse events are defined with Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 criteria and adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1950 patients from 80 centers in 10 countries were enrolled between July 2014 and October 2015. Of those, 1947 patients underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with the SAPIEN 3 (mean age, 81.6±6.6 years; 48.1% female). Main comorbidities included coronary artery disease (51.5%), renal insufficiency (27.4%), diabetes mellitus (29.5%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16.0%), and a mean logistic EuroSCORE of 18.3±13.2. Transfemoral access was used in 87.1% (n=1695); nontransfemoral, in 252 patients. Conscious sedation was used in 59.9% of transfemoral procedures, and in 50% of patients, TAVI was performed without aortic balloon valvuloplasty.

Long-term mortality in the propensity score-matched populations was the primary end point. Secondary end points were in-hospital/30-day mortality for the propensity score-matched populations and long-term mortality for the unmatched populations. In the matched population, time-to-event outcome for long-term mortality was extracted as hazard ratios, along with their variance. Statistical pooling of survival (time-to-event) was performed according to a random effect model, computing risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight propensity score-matched studies reporting on 10 287 matched patients (2-arterial graft: 5346; 3-arterial graft: 4941) were selected for final comparison.

Aspirin for Primary Cardiovascular Risk Prevention and Beyond in Diabetes Mellitus
<p>Daily administration of low-dose aspirin has proved to be beneficial in preventing recurrent cardiovascular events. However, the role of aspirin for primary prevention in patients with no overt cardiovascular disease is more controversial. In fact, in lower risk patients, the modest benefit in reducing serious vascular events can be offset by the increased risk of bleeding, including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Diabetes mellitus has been associated with a substantially increased risk of both first and recurrent atherothrombotic events, which makes aspirin therapy of potential value in these subjects. Moving from general aspects of aspirin pharmacology and specific issues in diabetes mellitus, this article reviews the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e on the topic of aspirin for primary prevention in general, and in subjects with diabetes mellitus in particular, to culminate with arguments pro and con and a practical risk-based algorithm for aspirin initiation in daily practice.</p>

Long Noncoding RNAs in Cardiovascular Pathology, Diagnosis, and Therapy
<p>Vast parts of mammalian genomes encode for transcripts that are not further translated into proteins. The purpose of the majority of such noncoding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) remained paradoxical for a long time. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that long noncoding RNAs are dynamically expressed in different cell types, diseases, or developmental stages to execute a wide variety of regulatory roles at virtually every step of gene expression and translation. Indeed, long noncoding RNAs influence gene expression via epigenetic modulations, through regulating alternative splicing, or by acting as molecular sponges. The abundance of long noncoding RNAs in the cardiovascular system indicates that they may be part of a complex regulatory network governing physiology and pathology of the heart. In this review, we discuss the multifaceted functions of long noncoding RNAs and highlight the current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">literatur</span></strong>e with an emphasis on cardiac development and disease. Furthermore, as the enormous spectrum of long noncoding RNAs potentially opens up new avenues for diagnosis and prevention of heart failure, we ultimately evaluate the futuristic prospects of long noncoding RNAs as biomarkers, and therapeutic targets for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, as well.</p>

Programmed ventricular stimulation was used to assess acute outcome. Primary end points were VT recurrence and the occurrence of cardiac and sudden cardiac death. Overall, 528 patients were treated by ablation (634 procedures; 1–4 procedures per patient). Among 482 tested with programmed ventricular stimulation after the last procedure, a class A result (noninducibility of any VT) was obtained in 371 patients (77%), class B (inducibility of non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed VT) in 12.4%, and class C (inducibility of index VT) in 10.6%.

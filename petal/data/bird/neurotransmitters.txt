Axon degeneration and PGC-1α-mediated protection in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein toxicity
<p>α-synuclein (aSyn) expression is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In animal models of these diseases, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> pathology often precedes cell death, raising the question of whether aSyn has compartment-specific toxic effects that could require early and/or independent therapeutic intervention. The relevance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al pathology to degeneration can only be addressed through longitudinal, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of different neuronal compartments. With current imaging methods, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>ergic neurons do not readily lend themselves to such a task in any vertebrate system. We therefore expressed human wild-type aSyn in zebrafish peripheral sensory neurons, which project elaborate superficial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s that can be continuously imaged <i>in vivo</i>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al outgrowth was normal in these neurons but, by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), many aSyn-expressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s became dystrophic, with focal varicosities or diffuse beading. Approximately 20% of aSyn-expressing cells died by 3 dpf. Time-lapse imaging revealed that focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al swelling, but not overt fragmentation, usually preceded cell death. Co-expressing aSyn with a mitochondrial reporter revealed deficits in mitochondrial transport and morphology even when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s appeared overtly normal. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>-protective protein Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> degeneration but not cell death caused by aSyn. By contrast, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which has roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive-oxygen-species detoxification, abrogated aSyn toxicity in both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> and the cell body. The rapid onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al pathology in this system, and the relatively moderate degree of cell death, provide a new model for the study of aSyn toxicity and protection. Moreover, the accessibility of peripheral sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s will allow effects of aSyn to be studied in different neuronal compartments and might have utility in screening for novel disease-modifying compounds.</p>

Hospital Variation in Time to Epinephrine for Nonshockable In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>For patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests attributable to nonshockable rhythms, delays in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration beyond 5 minutes is associated with worse survival.

Branch-restricted localization of phosphatase Prl-1 specifies axonal synaptogenesis domains
<p>Central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nervous system</span></strong> (CNS) circuit development requires subcellular control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e abundance. We identified the <i>Drosophila</i> membrane-anchored phosphatase of regenerating liver (Prl-1) as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>-intrinsic factor that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation in a spatially restricted fashion. The loss of Prl-1 in mechanosensory neurons reduced the number of CNS pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es localized on a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> collateral and organized as a terminal arbor. Flies lacking all Prl-1 protein had locomotor defects. The overexpression of Prl-1 induced ectopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. In mechanosensory neurons, Prl-1 modulates the insulin receptor (InR) signaling pathway within a single contralateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> compartment, thereby affecting the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> branch–specific localization and function of Prl-1 depend on untranslated regions of the <i>prl-1</i> messenger RNA (mRNA). Therefore, compartmentalized restriction of Prl-1 serves as a specificity factor for the subcellular control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al synaptogenesis.</p>

Time to Epinephrine Administration and Survival From Nonshockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Among Children and Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that earlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration is associated with improved survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable initial rhythms. However, the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e timing on patients with nonshockable initial rhythms is unclear. The objective of this study was to measure the association between time to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration and survival in adults and children with emergency medical services (EMS)–treated OHCA with nonshockable initial rhythms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of OHCAs prospectively identified by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium network from June 4, 2011, to June 30, 2015. We included patients of all ages with an EMS-treated OHCA and an initial nonshockable rhythm. We excluded those with return of spontaneous circulation in <10 minutes. We conducted a subgroup analysis involving patients <18 years of age. The primary exposure was time (minutes) from arrival of the first EMS agency to the first dose of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e. Secondary exposure was time to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e dichotomized as early (<10 minutes) or late (≥10 minutes). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. We adjusted for Utstein covariates and Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium study site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 55 568 EMS-treated OHCAs, 32 101 patients with initial nonshockable rhythms were included. There were 12 238 in the early group, 14 517 in the late group, and 5346 not treated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e. After adjusting for potential confounders, each minute from EMS arrival to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration was associated with a 4% decrease in odds of survival for adults, odds ratio=0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.98). A subgroup analysis (n=13 290) examining neurological outcomes showed a similar association (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94 per minute; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.98). When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e was given late in comparison with early, odds of survival were 18% lower (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.98). In a pediatric analysis (n=595), odds of survival were 9% lower (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.01) for each minute delay in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among OHCAs with nonshockable initial rhythms, the majority of patients were administered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e >10 minutes after EMS arrival.

Medical Therapy for Secondary Prevention and Long-Term Outcome in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 5% to 10% of all patients with myocardial infarction. Clinical trials of secondary prevention treatment in MINOCA patients are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between treatment with statins, renin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> system blockers, β-blockers, dual antiplatelet therapy, and long-term cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This is an observational study of MINOCA patients recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) between July 2003 and June 2013 and followed until December 2013 for outcome events in the Swedish Cause of Death Register and National Patient Register. Of 199 162 myocardial infarction admissions, 9466 consecutive unique patients with MINOCA were identified. Among those, the 9136 patients surviving the first 30 days after discharge constituted the study population. Mean age was 65.3 years, and 61% were women. No patient was lost to follow-up. A stratified propensity score analysis was performed to match treated and untreated groups. The association between treatment and outcome was estimated by comparing between treated and untreated groups by using Cox proportional hazards models. The exposures were treatment at discharge with statins, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme inhibitors/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events defined as all-cause mortality, hospitalization for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At discharge, 84.5%, 64.1%, 83.4%, and 66.4% of the patients were on statins, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme inhibitors/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively. During the follow-up of a mean of 4.1 years, 2183 (23.9%) patients experienced a major adverse cardiac event. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for major adverse cardiac events were 0.77 (0.68–0.87), 0.82 (0.73–0.93), and 0.86 (0.74–1.01) in patients on statins, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme inhibitors/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> receptor blockers, and β-blockers, respectively.

Activation of CaMKIV by soluble amyloid-β<sub>1–42</sub> impedes trafficking of axonal vesicles and impairs activity-dependent synaptogenesis
<p>The prefibrillar form of soluble amyloid-β (sAβ<sub>1–42</sub>) impairs synaptic function and is associated with the early phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We investigated how sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> led to presynaptic defects using a quantum dot–based, single particle–tracking method to monitor synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s. We found that sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> prevented new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation induced by chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, nanomolar amounts of sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance from presynaptic terminals and increased the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. This caused an increase in the phosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) and its substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in, which markedly inhibited SV trafficking along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. Neurons derived from a transgenic AD mouse model had similar defects, which were prevented by an inhibitor of CaMK kinase (CaMKK; which activates CaMKIV), by antibodies against Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>, or by expression a phosphodeficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in mutant. The CaMKK inhibitor also abolished the defects in activity-dependent synaptogenesis caused by sAβ<sub>1–42</sub>. Our results suggest that by disrupting SV reallocation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es, sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> prevents neurons from forming new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es or adjusting strength and activity among neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. Targeting this mechanism might prevent synaptic dysfunction in AD patients.</p>

Midbrain dopamine neurons control judgment of time
<p>Our sense of time is far from constant. For instance, time flies when we are having fun, and it slows to a trickle when we are bored. Midbrain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neurons have been implicated in variable time estimation. However, a direct link between signals carried by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neurons and temporal judgments is lacking. We measured and manipulated the activity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neurons as mice judged the duration of time intervals. We found that pharmacogenetic suppression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neurons decreased behavioral sensitivity to time and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neurons encoded information about trial-to-trial variability in time estimates. Last, we found that transient activation or inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neurons was sufficient to slow down or speed up time estimation, respectively. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neuron activity thus reflects and can directly control the judgment of time.</p>

Why does time seem to fly when we're having fun?
<p>Animals use the neurotransmitter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e to encode the relationship between their responses and reward. Reinforcement learning theory (<i>1</i>) successfully explains the role of phasic bursts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e in terms of future reward maximization. Yet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e clearly plays other roles in shaping behavior that have no obvious relationship to reinforcement learning, including modulating the rate at which our subjective sense of time grows in real time. On page 1273 of this issue, Soares <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) closely examine the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e in mice performing a task in which they keep track of the time between two events and make decisions about this temporal duration. The results suggest the need to reassess the leading theory of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e function in timing—the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e clock hypothesis (<i>3</i>). They may also help explain empirical phenomena that challenge the reinforcement learning account of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e function.</p>

Ultrafast neuronal imaging of dopamine dynamics with designed genetically encoded sensors
<p>Neuromodulatory systems exert profound influences on brain function. Understanding how these systems modify the operating mode of target circuits requires spatiotemporally precise measurement of neuromodulator release.

Astrocyte-derived interleukin-33 promotes microglial synapse engulfment and neural circuit development
<p>Neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and remodeling are essential to central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nervous system</span></strong> (CNS) development and are dysfunctional in neurodevelopmental diseases. Innate immune signals regulate tissue remodeling in the periphery, but how this affects CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es is largely unknown. Here, we show that the interleukin-1 family cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) is produced by developing astrocytes and is developmentally required for normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e numbers and neural circuit function in the spinal cord and thalamus. We find that IL-33 signals primarily to microglia under physiologic conditions, that it promotes microglial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e engulfment, and that it can drive microglial-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e depletion in vivo. These data reveal a cytokine-mediated mechanism required to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e homeostasis during CNS development.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e. In addition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

Locally translated mTOR controls axonal local translation in nerve injury
<p>How is protein synthesis initiated locally in neurons? We found that mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) was activated and then up-regulated in injured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s, owing to local translation of mTOR messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA was transported into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s by the cell size–regulating RNA-binding protein nucleolin. Furthermore, mTOR controlled local translation in injured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s. This included regulation of its own translation and that of retrograde injury signaling molecules such as importin β1 and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). Deletion of the mTOR 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) in mice reduced mTOR in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s and decreased local translation after nerve injury. Both pharmacological inhibition of mTOR in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s and deletion of the mTOR 3′UTR decreased proprioceptive neuronal survival after nerve injury. Thus, mRNA localization enables spatiotemporal control of mTOR pathways regulating local translation and long-range intracellular signaling.</p>

Ultrastructural evidence for synaptic scaling across the wake/sleep cycle
<p>It is assumed that synaptic strengthening and weakening balance throughout learning to avoid runaway potentiation and memory interference. However, energetic and informational considerations suggest that potentiation should occur primarily during wake, when animals learn, and depression should occur during sleep. We measured 6920 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es in mouse motor and sensory cortices using three-dimensional electron microscopy. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>-spine interface (ASI) decreased ~18% after sleep compared with wake. This decrease was proportional to ASI size, which is indicative of scaling. Scaling was selective, sparing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es that were large and lacked recycling endosomes. Similar scaling occurred for spine head volume, suggesting a distinction between weaker, more plastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es (~80%) and stronger, more stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. These results support the hypothesis that a core function of sleep is to renormalize overall synaptic strength increased by wake.</p>

Heterochronic Genes Turn Back the Clock in Old Neurons
<p>Although some neuron types regenerate better than others, all neurons lose the ability to regenerate with age. This intrinsic decline is the primary cause of regeneration failure even in permissive environments. This was shown in 1995 by comparing the regeneration ability of retinal neurons from different aged retinas growing into tectums of different ages (<i>1</i>). Embryonic retinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s regrew into tectum of any age, including older tectum with an inhibitory glial environment, whereas postnatal day 2 or older retinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s failed to regrow even into embryonic tectum. This indicated a “programmed” loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> regeneration ability with neuron age. Similarly, young hindbrain neurons transplanted into older spinal cords could regenerate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s into a normally inhibitory myelinated environment (<i>2</i>). Despite the clear therapeutic implications of these observations, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling age-dependent regenerative capacity were unclear. On page 372 in this issue, Zou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that the highly conserved <i>let-7</i>–LIN-41 heterochronic signaling pathway is responsible for part of the age-related decline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> regeneration in the worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.</p>

This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte–selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II, operating through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II type 1 receptor–dependent signaling in the isolated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>ogen. Indeed, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>ogen mRNA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced.

Distinct Regulatory Effects of Myeloid Cell and Endothelial Cell NAPDH Oxidase 2 on Blood Pressure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hypertension caused by increased renin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> system activation is associated with elevated reactive oxygen species production. Previous studies implicate NADPH oxidase (Nox) proteins as important reactive oxygen species sources during renin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> system activation, with different Nox isoforms being potentially involved. Among these, Nox2 is expressed in multiple cell types, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, and microglia. Blood pressure (BP) is regulated at the central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nervous system</span></strong>, renal, and vascular levels, but the cell-specific role of Nox2 in BP regulation is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We generated a novel mouse model with a floxed Nox2 gene and used Tie2-Cre, LysM Cre, or Cdh5-CreERT2 driver lines to develop cell-specific models of Nox2 perturbation to investigate its role in BP regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Unexpectedly, Nox2 deletion in myeloid but not endothelial cells resulted in a significant reduction in basal BP. Both Tie2-CreNox2 knockout (KO) mice (in which Nox2 was deficient in both endothelial cells and myeloid cells) and LysM CreNox2KO mice (in which Nox2 was deficient in myeloid cells) had significantly lower BP than littermate controls, whereas basal BP was unaltered in Cdh5-CreERT2 Nox2KO mice (in which Nox2 is deficient only in endothelial cells). The lower BP was attributable to an increased NO bioavailability that dynamically dilated resistance vessels in vivo under basal conditions without a change in renal function. Myeloid-specific Nox2 deletion had no effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced hypertension, which, however, was blunted in Tie2-CreNox2KO mice, along with preservation of endothelium-dependent relaxation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identify a hitherto unrecognized modulation of basal BP by myeloid cell Nox2, whereas endothelial cell Nox2 regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced hypertension.

The nociceptin receptor inhibits axonal regeneration and recovery from spinal cord injury
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al growth after traumatic spinal cord injury is limited by endogenous inhibitors, selective blockade of which promotes partial neurological recovery. The partial repair phenotypes suggest that compensatory pathways limit improvement. Gene expression profiles of mice deficient in <i>Ngr1</i>, which encodes a receptor for myelin-associated inhibitors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al regeneration such as Nogo, revealed that trauma increased the mRNA expression of <i>ORL1</i>, which encodes the receptor for the opioid-related peptide nociceptin. Endogenous and overexpressed ORL1 coimmunoprecipitated with immature NgR1 protein, and ORL1 enhanced the O-linked glycosylation and surface expression of NgR1 in HEK293T and Neuro2A cells and primary neurons. ORL1 overexpression inhibited cortical neuron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> regeneration independently of NgR1. Furthermore, regeneration was inhibited by an ORL1 agonist and enhanced by the ORL1 antagonist J113397 through a ROCK-dependent mechanism. Mice treated with J113397 after dorsal hemisection of the mid-thoracic spinal cord recovered greater locomotor function and exhibited lumbar raphespinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> sprouting. These effects were further enhanced by combined <i>Ngr1</i> deletion and ORL1 inhibition. Thus, ORL1 limits neural repair directly and indirectly by enhancing NgR1 maturation, and ORL1 antagonists enhance recovery from traumatic CNS injuries in wild-type and <i>Ngr1</i> null mice.</p>

Neuronal activity drives FMRP- and HSPG-dependent matrix metalloproteinase function required for rapid synaptogenesis
<p>Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) functions modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and activity-dependent plasticity. Aberrant MMP activity is implicated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disease caused by the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP and characterized by neurological dysfunction and intellectual disability. Gene expression studies in <i>Drosophila</i> suggest that Mmps cooperate with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp) to restrict trans-synaptic Wnt signaling and that synaptogenic defects in the fly model of FXS are alleviated by either inhibition of Mmp or genetic reduction of Dlp. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) glutamatergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e to test activity-dependent Dlp and Mmp intersections in the context of FXS. We found that rapid, activity-dependent synaptic bouton formation depended on secreted Mmp1. Acute neuronal stimulation reduced the abundance of Mmp2 but increased that of both Mmp1 and Dlp, as well as enhanced the colocalization of Dlp and Mmp1 at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e. Dlp function promoted Mmp1 abundance, localization, and proteolytic activity around <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. Dlp glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains mediated this functional interaction with Mmp1. In the FXS fly model, activity-dependent increases in Mmp1 abundance and activity were lost but were restored by reducing the amount of synaptic Dlp. The data suggest that neuronal activity-induced, HSPG-dependent Mmp regulation drives activity-dependent synaptogenesis and that this is impaired in FXS. Thus, exploring this mechanism further may reveal therapeutic targets that have the potential to restore synaptogenesis in FXS patients.</p>

D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor high-resolution structures enable the discovery of selective agonists
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e receptors are implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of nearly every neuropsychiatric disorder.

Dopamine oxidation mediates mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease
<p>Mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction have been implicated in substantia nigra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>ergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but how these pathways are linked in human neurons remains unclear. Here we studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>ergic neurons derived from patients with idiopathic and familial PD. We identified a time-dependent pathological cascade beginning with mitochondrial oxidant stress leading to oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e accumulation and ultimately resulting in reduced glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity, lysosomal dysfunction, and α-synuclein accumulation. This toxic cascade was observed in human, but not in mouse, PD neurons at least in part because of species-specific differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e metabolism. Increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e synthesis or α-synuclein amounts in mouse midbrain neurons recapitulated pathological phenotypes observed in human neurons. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e oxidation represents an important link between mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in PD pathogenesis.</p>

Pcdhαc2 is required for axonal tiling and assembly of serotonergic circuitries in mice
<p>Serotonergic neurons project their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s pervasively throughout the brain and innervate various target fields in a space-filling manner, leading to tiled arrangements of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> terminals to allow optimal allocation of serotonin among target neurons. Here we show that conditional deletion of the mouse protocadherin α (<i>Pcdh</i>α) gene cluster in serotonergic neurons disrupts local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al tiling and global assembly of serotonergic circuitries and results in depression-like behaviors. Genetic dissection and expression profiling revealed that this role is specifically mediated by Pcdhαc2, which is the only Pcdhα isoform expressed in serotonergic neurons. We conclude that, in contrast to neurite self-avoidance, which requires single-cell identity mediated by Pcdh diversity, a single cell-type identity mediated by the common C-type Pcdh isoform is required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al tiling and assembly of serotonergic circuitries.</p>

Homer1a drives homeostatic scaling-down of excitatory synapses during sleep
<p>Sleep is an essential process that supports learning and memory by acting on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es through poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Using biochemistry, proteomics, and imaging in mice, we find that during sleep, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es undergo widespread alterations in composition and signaling, including weakening of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es through removal and dephosphorylation of synaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors. These changes are driven by the immediate early gene Homer1a and signaling from group I metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1/5. Homer1a serves as a molecular integrator of arousal and sleep need via the wake- and sleep-promoting neuromodulators, noradrenaline and adenosine, respectively. Our data suggest that homeostatic scaling-down, a global form of synaptic plasticity, is active during sleep to remodel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es and participates in the consolidation of contextual memory.</p>

Building bridges to regenerate axons
<p>After traumatic spinal cord injury, local damage responses have an important effect on regenerating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s. In lower organisms (i.e., zebrafish and newt), glial cells and other non-neuronal cell types proliferate, migrate, and differentiate to form a bridge between the two ends of a transected spinal cord. This glial bridge supports <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> regeneration across the lesion site, enabling functional recovery. However, in mammals, a glial scar composed of mixed cell types and extracellular matrix forms to seal such a wound. Although early studies emphasized the inhibitory nature of this scar, recent studies have revealed that in mammals, as in lower organisms, it can also serve as a bridge to facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> regeneration (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). Yet, how this glial reaction is regulated remains largely unknown. On page 630 of this issue, Mokalled <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) report that connective tissue growth factor a (CTGFa) is crucial for directing glial bridging and subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> regeneration in a zebrafish model of spinal cord injury. Although it remains to be determined whether this is the case in mammals, this finding could inform the design of neural repair strategies.</p>

Using linked Medicare Part D prescription filling data, medication adherence was defined as proportion of days covered >80% within 90 days after discharge. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compare 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events among hospitals with high, moderate, and low 90-day medication adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By 90 days after MI, overall rates of adherence to medications prescribed at discharge were 68% for β-blockers, 63% for statins, 64% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme inhibitors/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> receptor blockers, and 72% for thienopyridines. Adherence to these medications up to 90 days varied significantly among hospitals: β-blockers (proportion of days covered >80%; 59% to 75%), statins (55% to 69%), thienopyridines (64% to 77%), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme inhibitors/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> receptor blockers (57% to 69%).

Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type I Controls Cardiomyocyte Transforming Growth Factor-β and Cardiac Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Fibrosis is the pathological consequence of stress-induced tissue remodeling and matrix accumulation. Increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) have been shown to promote fibrosis in multiple organ systems. Paradoxically, homozygous genetic deficiency of PAI-1 is associated with spontaneous age-dependent, cardiac-selective fibrosis in mice. We have identified a novel PAI-1-dependent mechanism that regulates cardiomyocyte-derived fibrogenic signals and cardiac transcriptional pathways during injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis in subjects with homozygous mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i> was evaluated with late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A murine cardiac injury model was performed by subcutaneous infusion of either saline or Angiotensin II by osmotic minipumps. We evaluated blood pressure, cardiac function (by echocardiography), fibrosis (with Masson Trichrome staining), and apoptosis (with TUNEL staining), and we performed transcriptome analysis (with RNA sequencing). We further evaluated fibrotic signaling in isolated murine primary ventricular myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis was detected in 2 otherwise healthy humans with complete PAI-1 deficiency because of a homozygous frameshift mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i>. In addition to its suppressive role during spontaneous cardiac fibrosis in multiple species, we hypothesized that PAI-1 also regulates fibrosis during cardiac injury. Treatment of young PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice with Angiotensin II induced extensive hypertrophy and fibrotic cardiomyopathy, with increased cardiac apoptosis and both reactive and replacement fibrosis. Although Angiotensin II-induced hypertension was blunted in PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, cardiac hypertrophy was accelerated. Furthermore, ventricular myocytes were found to be an important source of cardiac transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and PAI-1 regulated TGF-β synthesis by cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as in vivo during cardiac injury. Transcriptome analysis of ventricular RNA after Angiotensin II treatment confirmed that PAI-1 deficiency significantly enhanced multiple TGF-β signaling elements and transcriptional targets, including genes for extracellular matrix components, mediators of extracellular matrix remodeling, matricellular proteins, and cardiac integrins compared with wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PAI-1 is an essential repressor of cardiac fibrosis in mammals. We define a novel cardiomyocyte-specific regulatory mechanism for TGF-β production by PAI-1, which explains the paradoxical effect of PAI-1 deficiency in promoting cardiac-selective fibrosis. Thus, PAI-1 is a molecular switch that controls the cardiac TGF-β axis and its early transcriptional effects that lead to myocardial fibrosis.</p></sec>

Female Mice With an XY Sex Chromosome Complement Develop Severe Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a deadly pathology with strong sexual dimorphism. Similar to humans, female mice exhibit far lower incidences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced AAAs than males. In addition to sex hormones, the X and Y sex chromosomes, and their unique complements of genes, may contribute to sexually dimorphic AAA pathology. Here, we defined the effect of female (XX) versus male (XY) sex chromosome complement on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced AAA formation and rupture in phenotypically female mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Female low-density lipoprotein receptor (<i>Ldlr</i>) deficient mice with an XX or XY sex chromosome complement were infused with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II for 28 days to induce AAAs. Abdominal aortic lumen diameters were quantified by ultrasound, whereas AAA diameters were quantified at study end point. DNA microarrays were performed on abdominal aortas. To mimic males, female mice were administered a single dose of testosterone as neonates or as adults before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II infusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Female <i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup> deficient mice with an XX and XY sex chromosome complement had similar sex organ weights and low serum testosterone concentrations. Abdominal aortas from female XY mice selectively expressed Y chromosome genes, whereas genes known to escape X inactivation were higher in XX females. The majority of aortic gene differences in XY versus XX females fell within inflammatory pathways. AAA incidences doubled and aneurysms ruptured in XY females. AAAs from XY females exhibited inflammation, and plasma interleukin-1β concentrations were increased in XY females. Moreover, aortas from XY females had augmented matrix metalloproteinase activity and increased oxidative stress. Last, testosterone exposure applied chronically, or as a single bolus at postnatal day 1, markedly worsened AAA outcomes in XY in comparison with XX adult females.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An XY sex chromosome complement in phenotypic females profoundly influenced aortic gene expression profiles and promoted AAA severity. When XY females were exposed to testosterone, aneurysm rupture rates were striking. Mechanisms for augmented AAA severity in XY females include increased inflammation, augmented matrix metalloproteineases, and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that genes on the sex chromosomes regulate aortic vascular biology and contribute to sexual dimorphism of AAAs. Sex chromosome genes may serve as novel targets for sex-specific AAA therapeutics.</p></sec>

Long-Term Biased β-Arrestin Signaling Improves Cardiac Structure and Function in Dilated Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Biased agonism of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II receptor is known to promote cardiac contractility. Our laboratory indicated that these effects may be attributable to changes at the level of the myofilaments. However, these signaling mechanisms remain unknown. Because a common finding in dilated cardiomyopathy is a reduction in the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response, we hypothesized that β-arrestin signaling would increase myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> responsiveness in a model of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and improve cardiac function and morphology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We treated a dilated cardiomyopathy–linked mouse model expressing a mutant tropomyosin (Tm-E54K) for 3 months with either TRV120067, a β-arrestin 2–biased ligand of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II receptor, or losartan, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II receptor blocker. At the end of the treatment protocol, we assessed cardiac function using echocardiography, the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response of detergent-extracted fiber bundles, and used proteomic approaches to understand changes in posttranslational modifications of proteins that may explain functional changes. We also assessed signaling pathways altered in vivo and by using isolated myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>TRV120067- treated Tm-E54K mice showed improved cardiac structure and function, whereas losartan-treated mice had no improvement. Myofilaments of TRV120067-treated Tm-E54K mice had significantly improved myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> responsiveness, which was depressed in untreated Tm-E54K mice. We attributed these changes to increased MLC2v and MYPT1/2 phosphorylation seen only in TRV120067-treated mice. We found that the functional changes were attributable to an activation of ERK1/2-RSK3 signaling, mediated through β-arrestin, which may have a novel role in increasing MLC2v phosphorylation through a previously unrecognized interaction of β-arrestin localized to the sarcomere.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Long-term β-arrestin 2–biased agonism of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II receptor may be a viable approach to the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy by not only preventing maladaptive signaling, but also improving cardiac function by altering the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response via β-arrestin signaling pathways.</p></sec>

RasGRP1 promotes amphetamine-induced motor behavior through a Rhes interaction network (“Rhesactome”) in the striatum
<p>The striatum of the brain coordinates motor function. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e-related drugs may be therapeutic to patients with striatal neurodegeneration, such as Huntington’s disease (HD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), but these drugs have unwanted side effects. In addition to stimulating the release of nor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e, amphetamines, which are used for narcolepsy and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e release in the striatum. The guanosine triphosphatase Ras homolog enriched in the striatum (Rhes) inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>ergic signaling in the striatum, is implicated in HD and L-dopa–induced dyskinesia, and has a role in striatal motor control. We found that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 inhibited Rhes-mediated control of striatal motor activity in mice. RasGRP1 stabilized Rhes, increasing its synaptic accumulation in the striatum. Whereas partially Rhes-deficient (<i>Rhes</i><sup><i>+/−</i></sup>) mice had an enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine, this phenotype was attenuated by coincident depletion of RasGRP1. By proteomic analysis of striatal lysates from <i>Rhes</i>-heterozygous mice with wild-type or partial or complete knockout of <i>Rasgrp1</i>, we identified a diverse set of Rhes-interacting proteins, the “Rhesactome,” and determined that RasGRP1 affected the composition of the amphetamine-induced Rhesactome, which included PDE2A (phosphodiesterase 2A; a protein associated with major depressive disorder), LRRC7 (leucine-rich repeat–containing 7; a protein associated with bipolar disorder and ADHD), and DLG2 (discs large homolog 2; a protein associated with chronic pain). Thus, this Rhes network provides insight into striatal effects of amphetamine and may aid the development of strategies to treat various neurological and psychological disorders associated with the striatal dysfunction.</p>

Subtle modifications to oxytocin produce ligands that retain potency and improved selectivity across species
<p>Oxytocin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasopressin</span></strong> mediate various physiological functions that are important for osmoregulation, reproduction, cardiovascular function, social behavior, memory, and learning through four G protein–coupled receptors that are also implicated in high-profile disorders. Targeting these receptors is challenging because of the difficulty in obtaining ligands that retain selectivity across rodents and humans for translational studies. We identified a selective and more stable oxytocin receptor (OTR) agonist by subtly modifying the pharmacophore framework of human oxytocin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasopressin</span></strong>. [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH displayed similar potency to oxytocin but improved selectivity for OTR, an effect that was retained in mice. Centrally infused [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH potently reversed social fear in mice, confirming that this action was mediated by OTR and not by V1a or V1b <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasopressin</span></strong> receptors. In addition, [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH produced a more regular contraction pattern than did oxytocin in a preclinical labor induction and augmentation model using myometrial strips from cesarean sections. [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH had no activity in human cardiomyocytes, indicating a potentially improved safety profile and therapeutic window compared to those of clinically used oxytocin. In conclusion, [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH is a novel probe for validating OTR as a therapeutic target in various biological systems and is a promising new lead for therapeutic development. Our medicinal chemistry approach may also be applicable to other peptidergic signaling systems with similar selectivity issues.</p>

The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 promotes T cell adhesion by activating the adaptor protein CrkII in the immunological synapse
<p>The adaptor protein CrkII regulates T cell adhesion by recruiting the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, an activator of Rap1. Subsequently, Rap1 stimulates the integrin LFA-1, which leads to T cell adhesion and interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The adhesion of T cells to APCs is critical for their proper function and education. The interface between the T cell and the APC is known as the immunological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e. It is characterized by the specific organization of proteins that can be divided into central supramolecular activation clusters (c-SMACs) and peripheral SMACs (p-SMACs). Through total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and experiments with supported lipid bilayers, we determined that activated Rap1 was recruited to the immunological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e and localized to the p-SMAC. C3G and the active (dephosphorylated) form of CrkII also localized to the same compartment. In contrast, inactive (phosphorylated) CrkII was confined to the c-SMAC. Activation of CrkII and its subsequent movement from the c-SMAC to the p-SMAC depended on the phosphatase SHP-1, which acted downstream of the T cell receptor. In the p-SMAC, CrkII recruited C3G, which led to Rap1 activation and LFA-1–mediated adhesion of T cells to APCs. Functionally, SHP-1 was necessary for both the adhesion and migration of T cells. Together, these data highlight a signaling pathway in which SHP-1 acts through CrkII to reshape the pattern of Rap1 activation in the immunological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e.</p>

The glycosylation pathway is required for the secretion of Slit and for the maintenance of the Slit receptor Robo on axons
<p>Slit proteins act as repulsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> guidance cues by activating receptors of the Roundabout (Robo) family. During early neurogenesis in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, Slit prevents the growth cones of longitudinal tract neurons from inappropriately crossing the midline, thus restricting these cells to trajectories parallel to the midline. Slit is expressed in midline glial cells, and Robo is present in longitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> tracts and growth cones. We showed that the enzyme Mummy (Mmy) controlled Slit-Robo signaling through mechanisms that affected both the ligand and the receptor. Mmy was required for the glycosylation of Slit, which was essential for Slit secretion. Mmy was also required for maintaining the abundance and spatial distribution of Robo through an indirect mechanism that was independent of Slit secretion. Moreover, secretion of Slit was required to maintain the fasciculation and position of longitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> tracts, thus maintaining the hardwiring of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nervous system</span></strong>. Thus, Mmy is required for Slit secretion and for maintaining Robo abundance and distribution in the developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nervous system</span></strong> in <i>Drosophila</i>.</p>

Architects of neuronal wiring
<p>Nervous system function relies on precise connectivity of a multitude of distinct neuronal cell types. Each class of neuron exhibits a characteristic morphology where synaptic connections are patterned across the cell surface. Thus, individual types of neurons establish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es on specific domains of target neurons, such as the cell body (soma) or a distal branch (dendrite). Moreover, functionally related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es are often clustered on a dendrite or on one branch of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>. This compartmentalized organization of synaptic connections affects the integration of synaptic inputs and increases the computational power of neural circuits (<i>1</i>). Studies by Urwyler <i>et al.</i> on page 454 of this issue (<i>2</i>) and by Favuzzi <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report in a fruit fly and mouse model, respectively, mechanisms of how spatial distribution of synaptic connections is achieved.</p>

A gut-brain neural circuit for nutrient sensory transduction

Locally coordinated synaptic plasticity of visual cortex neurons in vivo
<p>Plasticity of cortical responses in vivo involves activity-dependent changes at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es, but the manner in which different forms of synaptic plasticity act together to create functional changes in neurons remains unknown. We found that spike timing–induced receptive field plasticity of visual cortex neurons in mice is anchored by increases in the synaptic strength of identified spines. This is accompanied by a decrease in the strength of adjacent spines on a slower time scale. The locally coordinated potentiation and depression of spines involves prominent AMPA receptor redistribution via targeted expression of the immediate early gene product Arc. Hebbian strengthening of activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es and heterosynaptic weakening of adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es thus cooperatively orchestrate cell-wide plasticity of functional neuronal responses.</p>

Cholesterol crystals impede nerve repair
<p>Damage to the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s represents the pathological hallmark of the neurological disorder multiple sclerosis (MS) and is thought to contribute to a number of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nervous system</span></strong> maladies (<i>1</i>).

On page 684 of this issue, Cantuti-Castelvetri <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that insufficient clearance (phagocytosis) of damaged myelin by aged macrophages results in the accumulation of cholesterol crystals in these cells, which elicits a maladaptive inflammatory response that is associated with impaired remyelination.

Interacting amino acid replacements allow poison frogs to evolve epibatidine resistance

Epibatidine shares a highly conserved binding site with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acetylcholin</span></strong>e, making it difficult to evolve resistance yet maintain nAChR function. Electrophysiological assays of human and frog nAChR revealed that one amino acid replacement, which evolved three times in poison frogs, decreased epibatidine sensitivity but at a cost of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acetylcholin</span></strong>e sensitivity. However, receptor functionality was rescued by additional amino acid replacements that differed among poison frog lineages.

Multicluster Pcdh diversity is required for mouse olfactory neural circuit assembly
<p>The vertebrate clustered protocadherin (Pcdh) cell surface proteins are encoded by three closely linked gene clusters (<i>Pcdh</i>α, <i>Pcdh</i>β, and <i>Pcdh</i>γ). Here, we show that all three gene clusters functionally cooperate to provide individual mouse olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) with the cell surface diversity required for their assembly into distinct glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Although deletion of individual <i>Pcdh</i> clusters had subtle phenotypic consequences, the loss of all three clusters (tricluster deletion) led to a severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al arborization defect and loss of self-avoidance. By contrast, when endogenous Pcdh diversity is overridden by the expression of a single–tricluster gene repertoire (α and β and γ), OSN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s fail to converge to form glomeruli, likely owing to contact-mediated repulsion between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s expressing identical combinations of Pcdh isoforms.</p>

Loss of the E3 ubiquitin ligase LRSAM1 sensitizes peripheral axons to degeneration in a mouse model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
<p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> degeneration with subsequent motor and sensory deficits. Several CMT gene products function in endosomal sorting and trafficking to the lysosome, suggesting that defects in this cellular pathway might present a common pathogenic mechanism for these conditions. LRSAM1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is implicated in this process, and mutations in <i>LRSAM1</i> have recently been shown to cause CMT. We have generated mouse mutations in <i>Lrsam1</i> to create an animal model of this form of CMT (CMT2P). Mouse <i>Lrsam1</i> is abundantly expressed in the motor and sensory neurons of the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nervous system</span></strong>. Both homozygous and heterozygous mice have largely normal neuromuscular performance and only a very mild neuropathy phenotype with age. However, <i>Lrsam1</i> mutant mice are more sensitive to challenge with acrylamide, a neurotoxic agent that causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> degeneration, indicating that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s in the mutant mice are indeed compromised. In transfected cells, LRSAM1 primarily localizes in a perinuclear compartment immediately beyond the Golgi and shows little colocalization with components of the endosome to lysosome trafficking pathway, suggesting that other cellular mechanisms also merit consideration.</p>

A Novel α-Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Analogue Protects Against End-Organ Damage in Experimental Hypertension, Cardiac Hypertrophy, and Heart Failure

Here, we evaluate whether a novel potent and long-lasting (<i>t</i><sub>½</sub> ≥7 hours) acylated α-CGRP analogue (αAnalogue) could alleviate and reverse cardiovascular disease in 2 distinct murine models of hypertension and heart failure in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ability of the αAnalogue to act selectively via the CGRP pathway was shown in skin by using a CGRP receptor antagonist. The effect of the αAnalogue on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced hypertension was investigated over 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. The ability of the αAnalogue to modulate heart failure was studied in an abdominal aortic constriction model of murine cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure over 5 weeks. Extensive ex vivo analysis was performed via RNA analysis, Western blot, and histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced hypertension was attenuated by cotreatment with the αAnalogue (50 nmol·kg<sup>–1</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>, SC, at a dose selected for lack of long-term hypotensive effects at baseline). The αAnalogue protected against vascular, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, characterized by reduced hypertrophy and biomarkers of fibrosis, remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In a separate study, the αAnalogue reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced hypertension and associated vascular and cardiac damage. The αAnalogue was effective over 5 weeks in a murine model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. It preserved heart function, assessed by echocardiography, while protecting against adverse cardiac remodeling and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the αAnalogue was well tolerated with neither signs of desensitization nor behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings, in 2 distinct models, provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of a stabilized αAnalogue, by mediating (1) antihypertensive effects, (2) attenuating cardiac remodeling, and (3) increasing angiogenesis and cell survival to protect against and limit damage associated with the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This indicates the therapeutic potential of the CGRP pathway and the possibility that this injectable CGRP analogue may be effective in cardiac disease.</p></sec>

Tryptophan-Derived 3-Hydroxyanthranilic Acid Contributes to Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Formation in Mice In Vivo
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abnormal amino acid metabolism is associated with vascular disease. However, the causative link between dysregulated tryptophan metabolism and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. Mice with deficiencies in both apolipoprotein e (Apoe) and IDO (Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup>) were generated by cross-breeding IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice with Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The acute infusion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II markedly increased the incidence of AAA in Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice, but not in Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice, which presented decreased elastic lamina degradation and aortic expansion. These features were not altered by the reconstitution of bone marrow cells from IDO<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II infusion instigated interferon-γ, which induced the expression of IDO and kynureninase and increased 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) levels in the plasma and aortas of Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice, but not in IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice. Both IDO and kynureninase controlled the production of 3-HAA in vascular smooth muscle cells. 3-HAA upregulated matrix metallopeptidase 2 via transcription factor nuclear factor-κB. Furthermore, kynureninase knockdown in mice restrained 3-HAA, matrix metallopeptidase 2, and resultant AAA formation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II infusion. Intraperitoneal injections of 3-HAA into Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> and Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice for 6 weeks increased the expression and activity of matrix metallopeptidase 2 in aortas without affecting metabolic parameters. Finally, human AAA samples had stronger staining with the antibodies against 3-HAA, IDO, and kynureninase than those in adjacent nonaneurysmal aortic sections of human AAA samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data define a previously undescribed causative role for 3-HAA, which is a product of tryptophan metabolism, in AAA formation. Furthermore, these findings suggest that 3-HAA reduction may be a new target for treating cardiovascular diseases.</p></sec>

Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Microparticles (MPs) have emerged as a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. This study examined the potential of MPs from senescent endothelial cells (ECs) or from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to promote premature EC aging and thrombogenicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Primary porcine coronary ECs were isolated from the left circumflex coronary artery. MPs were prepared from ECs and venous blood from patients with ACS (n=30) and from healthy volunteers (n=4) by sequential centrifugation. The level of endothelial senescence was assessed as senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity using flow cytometry, oxidative stress using the redox-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, tissue factor activity using an enzymatic Tenase assay, the level of target protein expression by Western blot analysis, platelet aggregation using an aggregometer, and shear stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Senescence, as assessed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, was induced by the passaging of porcine coronary artery ECs from passage P1 to P4, and was associated with a progressive shedding of procoagulant MPs. Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme activity and upregulated AT1 receptors and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme in P1 ECs. Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, and inhibitors of either mitogen-activated protein kinases or phosphoinositide 3-kinase prevented the MP-induced endothelial senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients induce premature endothelial senescence under atheroprone low shear stress and thrombogenicity through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced redox-sensitive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt. They further suggest that targeting endothelial-derived MP shedding and their bioactivity may be a promising therapeutic strategy to limit the development of an endothelial dysfunction post-ACS.</p></sec>

Gating of social reward by oxytocin in the ventral tegmental area
<p>The reward generated by social interactions is critical for promoting prosocial behaviors. Here we present evidence that oxytocin (OXT) release in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key node of the brain’s reward circuitry, is necessary to elicit social reward. During social interactions, activity in paraventricular nucleus (PVN) OXT neurons increased. Direct activation of these neurons in the PVN or their terminals in the VTA enhanced prosocial behaviors. Conversely, inhibition of PVN OXT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> terminals in the VTA decreased social interactions. OXT increased excitatory drive onto reward-specific VTA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e (DA) neurons. These results demonstrate that OXT promotes prosocial behavior through direct effects on VTA DA neurons, thus providing mechanistic insight into how social interactions can generate rewarding experiences.</p>

Rapid binge-like eating and body weight gain driven by zona incerta GABA neuron activation
<p>The neuronal substrate for binge eating, which can at times lead to obesity, is not clear. We find that optogenetic stimulation of mouse zona incerta (ZI) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons or their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al projections to paraventricular thalamus (PVT) excitatory neurons immediately (in 2 to 3 seconds) evoked binge-like eating. Minimal intermittent stimulation led to body weight gain; ZI GABA neuron ablation reduced weight. ZI stimulation generated 35% of normal 24-hour food intake in just 10 minutes. The ZI cells were excited by food deprivation and the gut hunger signal ghrelin. In contrast, stimulation of excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s from the parasubthalamic nucleus to PVT or direct stimulation of PVT glutamate neurons reduced food intake. These data suggest an unexpected robust orexigenic potential for the ZI GABA neurons.</p>

Three-dimensional Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging advances understanding of astrocyte biology
<p>Astrocyte communication is typically studied by two-dimensional calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) imaging, but this method has not yielded conclusive data on the role of astrocytes in synaptic and vascular function. We developed a three-dimensional two-photon imaging approach and studied Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in entire astrocyte volumes, including during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>-astrocyte interactions. In both awake mice and brain slices, we found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in an individual astrocyte is scattered throughout the cell, largely compartmented between regions, preponderantly local within regions, and heterogeneously distributed regionally and locally. Processes and endfeet displayed frequent fast activity, whereas the soma was infrequently active. In awake mice, activity was higher than in brain slices, particularly in endfeet and processes, and displayed occasional multifocal cellwide events. Astrocytes responded locally to minimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al firing with time-correlated Ca<sup>2+</sup> spots.</p>

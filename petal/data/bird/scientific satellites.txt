Pericardial Adipose Tissue Regulates Granulopoiesis, Fibrosis, and Cardiac Function After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The pericardial adipose tissue (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>) contains a high density of lymphoid clusters. It is unknown whether these clusters play a role in post–myocardial infarction (MI) inflamm<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ory responses and cardiac outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lymphoid clusters were examined in epicardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> of humans with or without coronary artery disease. Murine pericardial lymphoid clusters were visualized in mice subjected to coronary artery lig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion. To study the relevance of pericardial clusters during inflamm<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ory responses after MI, we surgically removed the pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> and performed B-cell depletion and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing factor blockade. Leukocytes in murine hearts, pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>, spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bone marrow were quantified by flow cytometry. Cannabinoid receptor CB2 (CB2<sup>–/–</sup>) mice were used as a model for enhanced B-cell responses. The effect of impaired dendritic cell (DC) trafficking on pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> inflamm<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ory responses was tested in CCR7<sup>–/–</sup> mice subjected to MI. Cardiac fibrosis and ventricular function were assessed by histology and echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified larger B-cell clusters in epicardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> of human p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ients with coronary artery disease in comparison with controls without coronary artery disease. Infarcted mice also had larger pericardial clusters and 3-fold upregul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing factor–producing B cells within pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>, but not spleen or lymph nodes. This was associ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed with higher DC and T-cell counts in pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>, which outnumbered DCs and T cells in lymph nodes. Analysis of DC m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ur<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion markers, tracking experiments with fluorescently labeled cells, and use of CCR7-deficient mice suggested th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> activ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed DCs migr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e from infarcts into pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> via CCR7. B-cell depletion or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing factor neutraliz<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion inhibited DC and T-cell expansion within pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>, and transl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed into reduced bone marrow granulopoiesis and cardiac neutrophil infiltr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion 3 days after MI. The relevance of the pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> in medi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing all these effects was confirmed by removal of pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> and ex vivo coculture with pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> and granulocyte progenitors. Finally, enhanced fibrosis and worsened ejection fraction in CB2<sup>–/–</sup> mice were limited by pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> removal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings unveil a new mechanism by which the pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> coordin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es immune cell activ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion, granulopoiesis, and outcome after MI.</p></sec>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Gibberellins Regulate Ovule Integument Development by Interfering with the Transcription Factor ATS
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e most plant life cycle aspects, including flowering and fruit development. Here, we demonstr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e the implic<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of GAs in ovule development. DELLA proteins, neg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ive GA response regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ors, act as positive factors for ovule integument development in a mechanism th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> involves transcription factor ABERRANT TESTA SHAPE (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>S). The seeds of the <i>della global</i> mutant, a complete loss-of-function of DELLA, and the <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>s-1</i> mutant are remarkably similar, with a round shape, a disorganized testa, and viviparism. These defects are the result of an alter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion in integuments th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> fail to fully develop and are shorter than in wild-type plants. <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>s-1</i> also shows some GA-rel<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed phenotypes, for example, higher germin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es and early flowering. In fact, <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>s-1</i> has elev<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed GA levels due to the activ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of GA biosynthesis genes, which indic<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>S inhibits GA biosynthesis. Moreover, DELLAs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>S proteins interact, which suggests the form<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of a transcriptional complex th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es the expression of genes involved in integument growth. Therefore, the repression of GA biosynthesis by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>S would result in the stabiliz<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of DELLAs to ensure correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>S-DELLA complex form<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion. The requirement of both activities to coordin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e proper ovule development strongly argues th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>S-DELLA complex acts as a key molecular factor. This work provides the first evidence for a role of GAs in ovule and seed development.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>omic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the frequency stability of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed by increases in signal-to-noise r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>io. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> low bandwidths, notably, increased damping leads to better stability and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing temper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ure resolution of 60 microkelvin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> 300-hertz bandwidth.

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites

However, in r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ites (order Palaeogn<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>hae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferenti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed > 130 Ma. To better understand wh<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The loc<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in females, we estim<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>io of GC > <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>:<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>io of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> dosage compens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>io of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>io of close to 2. These observ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ions resemble the p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>terns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e of sex chromosome differenti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ypically low.

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels

Previous studies showed suppression of succin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e-fuelled respir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ur<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing succin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e concentr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e concentr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ions or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e concentr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion during torpor.

Functional outcome and alignment in computer-assisted and conventionally operated total knee replacements
<p>We performed a randomised controlled trial comparing   computer-assisted surgery (CAS) with conventional surgery (CONV)   in total knee replacement (TKR). Between 2009 and 2011 a total of   192 p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ients with a mean age of 68 years (55 to 85) with osteoarthritis   or arthritic disease of the knee were recruited from four Norwegian   hospitals. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> three months follow-up, functional results were marginally   better for the CAS group. Mean differences (MD) in favour of CAS   were found for the Knee Society function score (MD: 5.9, 95% confidence   interval (CI) 0.3 to 11.4, p = 0.039), the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis   Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales for ‘pain’ (MD: 7.7, 95% CI 1.7 to   13.6, p = 0.012), ‘sports’ (MD: 13.5, 95% CI 5.6 to 21.4, p = 0.001)   and ‘quality of life’ (MD: 7.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 14.3, p = 0.046).   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> one-year follow-up, differences favouring CAS were found for   KOOS ‘sports’ (MD: 11.0, 95% CI 3.0 to 19.0, p = 0.007) and KOOS   ‘symptoms’ (MD: 6.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 13.0, p = 0.035). The use of   CAS resulted in fewer outliers in frontal alignment (> 3° malalignment),   both for the entire TKR (37.9% <i>vs</i> 17.9%, p = 0.042)   and for the tibial component separ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ely (28.4% <i>vs</i> 6.3%,   p = 0.002). Tibial slope was better achieved with CAS (58.9% <i>vs</i> 26.3%,   p < 0.001). Oper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion time was 20 minutes longer with CAS. In   conclusion, functional results were, st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>istically, marginally in favour   of CAS. Also, CAS was more predictable than CONV for mechanical   alignment and positioning of the prosthesis.

Dynamic clonal analysis based on chronic <i>in vivo</i> imaging allows multiscale quantification of growth in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc
<p>In the course of morphogenesis, tissues change shape and grow. How this is orchestr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed is largely unknown, partly owing to the lack of experimental methods to visualize and quantify growth. Here, we describe a novel experimental approach to investig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e the growth of tissues <i>in vivo</i> on a time-scale of days, as employed to study the <i>Drosophila</i> larval imaginal wing disc, the precursor of the adult wing. We developed a protocol to image wing discs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> regular intervals in living anesthetized larvae so as to follow the growth of the tissue over extended periods of time. This approach can be used to image cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> high resolution <i>in vivo</i>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> intermedi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e scale, we tracked the increase in cell number within clones as well as the changes in clone area and shape. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> scales extending to the tissue level, clones can be used as landmarks for measuring strain, as a proxy for growth. We developed general comput<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ional tools to extract strain maps from clonal shapes and landmark displacements in individual tissues, and to combine multiple d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>asets into a mean strain. In the disc, we use these to compare properties of growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the scale of clones (a few cells) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> larger regional scales.</p>

Identification of <i>Ssm1b</i>, a novel modifier of DNA methylation, and its expression during mouse embryogenesis
<p>The strain-specific modifier Ssm1 is responsible for the strain-dependent methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of particular <i>E. coli gpt-</i>containing transgenic sequences. Here, we identify <i>Ssm1</i> as the KRAB-zinc finger (ZF) gene 2610305D13Rik loc<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed on distal chromosome 4. <i>Ssm1b</i> is a member of a gene family with an unusual array of three ZFs. Ssm1 family members in C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) mice have various amino acid changes in their ZF domain and in the linker between the KRAB and ZF domains. <i>Ssm1b</i> is expressed up to E8.5; its target transgene gains partial methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion by this stage as well. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> E9.5, <i>Ssm1b</i> mRNA is no longer expressed but by then its target has become completely methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed. By contrast, in D2 embryos the transgene is essentially unmethyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed. Methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion during B6 embryonic development depends on <i>Dnmt3b</i> but not <i>Mecp2</i>. In differenti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ing B6 embryonic stem cells methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion spreads from <i>gpt</i> to a co-integr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed <i>neo</i> gene th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> has a similarly high CpG content as <i>gpt</i>, but <i>neo</i> alone is not methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed. In adult B6 mice, <i>Ssm1b</i> is expressed in ovaries, but in other organs only other members of the <i>Ssm1</i> family are expressed. Interestingly, the transgene becomes methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed when crossed into some, but not other, wild mice th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> were kept outbred in the labor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ory. Thus, polymorphisms for the methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>terns seen among labor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ory inbred strains are also found in a free-living popul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion. This may imply th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> mice th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> do not have the <i>Ssm1b</i> gene may use another member of the <i>Ssm1</i> family to control the potentially harmful expression of certain endogenous or exogenous genes.</p>

Runx1 Deficiency Protects Against Adverse Cardiac Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of heart failure and de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>h worldwide.

Interleukin-10 Inhibits Bone Marrow Fibroblast Progenitor Cell–Mediated Cardiac Fibrosis in Pressure-Overloaded Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Activ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) play a critical role in cardiac fibrosis; however, their origin in the diseased heart remains unclear, warranting further investig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion. Recent studies suggest the contribution of bone marrow fibroblast progenitor cells (BM-FPCs) in pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis. We have previously shown th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> interleukin-10 (IL10) suppresses pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis; however, the role of IL10 in inhibition of BM-FPC–medi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed cardiac fibrosis is not known. We hypothesized th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> IL10 inhibits pressure overload–induced homing of BM-FPCs to the heart and their transdifferenti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion to myofibroblasts and thus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>tenu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pressure overload was induced in wild-type (WT) and IL10 knockout (IL10KO) mice by transverse aortic constriction.

Furthermore, WT bone marrow (from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice) transplant<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion in bone marrow–depleted IL10KO mice (IL10KO chimeric mice) reduced transverse aortic constriction–induced BM-FPC mobiliz<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion compared with IL10KO mice. Green fluorescent protein costaining with α-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1α in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric mice suggests th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> myofibroblasts were derived from bone marrow after transverse aortic constriction. Finally, WT bone marrow transplant<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion in IL10KO mice inhibited transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac fibrosis and improved heart function. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the molecular level, IL10 tre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ment significantly inhibited transforming growth factor-β–induced transdifferenti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion and fibrotic signaling in WT BM-FPCs in vitro.

Effects of PCSK9 Inhibition With Alirocumab on Lipoprotein Metabolism in Healthy Humans
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B100 (apoB). Although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ic LDL receptors as the basis for LDL lowering by PCSK9 inhibitors, there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on lipoprotein metabolism. In particular, it is not known whether inhibition of PCSK9 has any effects on very low-density lipoprotein or intermedi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e-density lipoprotein (IDL) metabolism. Inhibition of PCSK9 also results in reductions of plasma lipoprotein (a) levels. The regul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion of plasma Lp(a) levels, including the role of LDL receptors in the clearance of Lp(a), is poorly defined, and no mechanistic studies of the Lp(a) lowering by alirocumab in humans have been published to d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Eighteen (10 F, 8 mol/L) participants completed a placebo-controlled, 2-period study. They received 2 doses of placebo, 2 weeks apart, followed by 5 doses of 150 mg of alirocumab, 2 weeks apart. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> the end of each period, fractional clearance r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es (FCRs) and production r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>es (PRs) of apoB and apo(a) were determined. In 10 participants, postprandial triglycerides and apoB48 levels were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Alirocumab reduced ultracentrifugally isol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ed LDL-C by 55.1%, LDL-apoB by 56.3%, and plasma Lp(a) by 18.7%. The fall in LDL-apoB was caused by an 80.4% increase in LDL-apoB FCR and a 23.9% reduction in LDL-apoB PR. The l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ter was due to a 46.1% increase in IDL-apoB FCR coupled with a 27.2% decrease in conversion of IDL to LDL. The FCR of apo(a) tended to increase (24.6%) without any change in apo(a) PR. Alirocumab had no effects on FCRs or PRs of very low-density lipoproteins-apoB and very low-density lipoproteins triglycerides or on postprandial plasma triglycerides or apoB48 concentr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Alirocumab decreased LDL-C and LDL-apoB by increasing IDL- and LDL-apoB FCRs and decreasing LDL-apoB PR. These results are consistent with increases in LDL receptors available to clear IDL and LDL from blood during PCSK9 inhibition. The increase in apo(a) FCR during alirocumab tre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ment suggests th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong> increased LDL receptors may also play a role in the reduction of plasma Lp(a).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">at</span></strong>ion:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Speleothems Reveal 500,000-Year History of Siberian Permafrost
<sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permafrost</span></strong> Thaw Predictions</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permafrost</span></strong> contains twice as much carbon as the atmosphere which could have serious consequences if it were to be released by widespread thawing. <bold>Vaks <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 183, published online 21 February) present a 450,000 year-long record of speleothem growth at selected locations in Siberia, which traces changes in the extent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permafrost</span></strong> over that time period. The authors conclude that conditions only slightly warmer than those of today would cause widespread thawing of continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permafrost</span></strong> as far north as 60°N.</p></sec>

Observed rapid bedrock uplift in Amundsen Sea Embayment promotes ice-sheet stability
<p>The marine portion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) accounts for one-fourth of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cryospher</span></strong>ic contribution to global sea-level rise and is vulnerable to catastrophic collapse. The bedrock response to ice mass loss, glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), was thought to occur on a time scale of 10,000 years. We used new GPS measurements, which show a rapid (41 millimeters per year) uplift of the ASE, to estimate the viscosity of the mantle underneath. We found a much lower viscosity (4 × 10<sup>18</sup> pascal-second) than global average, and this shortens the GIA response time scale from tens to hundreds of years. Our finding requires an upward revision of ice mass loss from gravity data of 10% and increases the potential stability of the WAIS against catastrophic collapse.</p>

The South Asian monsoon—pollution pump and purifier
<p>Air pollution is growing fastest in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong>-affected South Asia. During the dry winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong>, the fumes disperse toward the Indian Ocean, creating a vast pollution haze, but their fate during the wet summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong> has been unclear. We performed atmospheric chemistry measurements by aircraft in the Oxidation Mechanism Observations campaign, sampling the summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong> outflow in the upper troposphere between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The measurements, supported by model calculations, show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong> sustains a remarkably efficient cleansing mechanism by which contaminants are rapidly oxidized and deposited to Earth’s surface. However, some pollutants are lofted above the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong> clouds and chemically processed in a reactive reservoir before being redistributed globally, including to the stratosphere.</p>

More tornadoes in the most extreme U.S. tornado outbreaks
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tornado</span></strong>es and severe thunderstorms kill people and damage property every year. Estimated U.S. insured losses due to severe thunderstorms in the first half of 2016 were $8.5 billion (US). The largest U.S. effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tornado</span></strong>es result from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tornado</span></strong> outbreaks, which are sequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tornado</span></strong>es that occur in close succession. Here, using extreme value analysis, we find that the frequency of U.S. outbreaks with many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tornado</span></strong>es is increasing and that it is increasing faster for more extreme outbreaks. We model this behavior by extreme value distributions with parameters that are linear functions of time or of some indicators of multidecadal climatic variability. Extreme meteorological environments associated with severe thunderstorms show consistent upward trends, but the trends do not resemble those currently expected to result from global warming.</p>

East Asian hydroclimate modulated by the position of the westerlies during Termination I
<p>Speleothem oxygen isotope records have revolutionized our understanding of the paleo East Asian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong>, yet there is fundamental disagreement on what they represent in terms of the hydroclimate changes. We report a multiproxy speleothem record of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong> evolution during the last deglaciation from the middle Yangtze region, which indicates a wetter central eastern China during North Atlantic cooling episodes, despite the oxygen isotopic record suggesting a weaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong>. We show that this apparent contradiction can be resolved if the changes are interpreted as a lengthening of the Meiyu rains and shortened post-Meiyu stage, in accordance with a recent hypothesis. Model simulations support this interpretation and further reveal the role of the westerlies in communicating the North Atlantic influence to the East Asian climate.</p>

A 550,000-year record of East Asian monsoon rainfall from <sup>10</sup>Be in loess
<p>Cosmogenic <sup>10</sup>Be flux from the atmosphere is a proxy for rainfall. Using this proxy, we derived a 550,000-year-long record of East Asian summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong> (EASM) rainfall from Chinese loess. This record is forced at orbital precession frequencies, with higher rainfall observed during Northern Hemisphere summer insolation maxima, although this response is damped during cold interstadials. The <sup>10</sup>Be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong> rainfall proxy is also highly correlated with global ice-volume variations, which differs from Chinese cave δ<sup>18</sup>O, which is only weakly correlated. We argue that both EASM intensity and Chinese cave δ<sup>18</sup>O are not governed by high-northern-latitude insolation, as suggested by others, but rather by low-latitude interhemispheric insolation gradients, which may also strongly influence global ice volume via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong> dynamics.</p>

Glacial lake outburst floods as drivers of fluvial erosion in the Himalaya
<p>Himalayan rivers are frequently hit by catastrophic floods that are caused by the failure of glacial lake and landslide dams; however, the dynamics and long-term impacts of such floods remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive set of observations that capture the July 2016 glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in the Bhotekoshi/Sunkoshi River of Nepal. Seismic records of the flood provide new insights into GLOF mechanics and their ability to mobilize large boulders that otherwise prevent channel erosion. Because of this boulder mobilization, GLOF impacts far exceed those of the annual summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong>, and GLOFs may dominate fluvial erosion and channel-hillslope coupling many tens of kilometers downstream of glaciated areas. Long-term valley evolution in these regions may therefore be driven by GLOF frequency and magnitude, rather than by precipitation.</p>

Disease sleuths unmask deadly encephalitis culprit
<p>Soon after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monsoon</span></strong> rains arrive in June, the northern city of Gorakhpur transforms into the "encephalitis capital of India." Hundreds of children from across the surrounding Uttar Pradesh state arrive at Baba Raghav Das Medical College with the brain inflammation that causes delirium, seizures, and—in about 20% of those patients—death. For decades, the recurring spates of cases and high mortality rate stumped experts. Now, medical detectives think they have solved the mystery: A major cause of the seasonal encephalitis outbreaks is scrub typhus, a bacterial malady transmitted by a microscopic mite. The culprit was first unmasked 3 years ago—but most researchers didn't believe it then. The new evidence, described this month in <i>Emerging Infectious Diseases</i>, indicates the responsible bacterium is far more dangerous than realized.</p>

<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Hummingbirds flying through intense upward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gust</span></strong>s experience pronounced downward pitching motions (i.e. nose dives). In response, they interrupt flapping, hold the wings dorsally, and angle and fan the tail.</p>

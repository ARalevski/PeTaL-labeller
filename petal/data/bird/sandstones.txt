Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> compaction or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Under moderate and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength.</p>

Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

The whole-soil carbon flux in response to warming
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> organic carbon harbors three times as much carbon as Earth’s atmosphere, and its decomposition is a potentially large climate change feedback and major source of uncertainty in climate projections. The response of whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> profiles to warming has not been tested in situ. In a deep warming experiment in mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>, we found that CO<sub>2</sub> production from all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> depths increased with 4°C warming; annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> respiration increased by 34 to 37%. All depths responded to warming with similar temperature sensitivities, driven by decomposition of decadal-aged carbon. Whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> warming reveals a larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> respiration response than many in situ experiments (most of which only warm the surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>) and models.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

A global atlas of the dominant bacteria found in soil
<p>The immense diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> bacterial communities has stymied efforts to characterize individual taxa and document their global distributions. We analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s from 237 locations across six continents and found that only 2% of bacterial phylotypes (~500 phylotypes) consistently accounted for almost half of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> bacterial communities worldwide. Despite the overwhelming diversity of bacterial communities, relatively few bacterial taxa are abundant in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s globally. We clustered these dominant taxa into ecological groups to build the first global atlas of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> bacterial taxa. Our study narrows down the immense number of bacterial taxa to a “most wanted” list that will be fruitful targets for genomic and cultivation-based efforts aimed at improving our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> microbes and their contributions to ecosystem functioning.</p>

Long-term pattern and magnitude of soil carbon feedback to the climate system in a warming world
<p>In a 26-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> warming experiment in a mid-latitude hardwood forest, we documented changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon cycling to investigate the potential consequences for the climate system. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> warming results in a four-phase pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> organic matter decay and carbon dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere, with phases of substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon loss alternating with phases of no detectable loss. Several factors combine to affect the timing, magnitude, and thermal acclimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon loss. These include depletion of microbially accessible carbon pools, reductions in microbial biomass, a shift in microbial carbon use efficiency, and changes in microbial community composition. Our results support projections of a long-term, self-reinforcing carbon feedback from mid-latitude forests to the climate system as the world warms.</p>

Plant-soil feedback and the maintenance of diversity in Mediterranean-climate shrublands
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota influence plant performance through plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedback, but it is unclear whether the strength of such feedback depends on plant traits and whether plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedback drives local plant diversity. We grew 16 co-occurring plant species with contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies from hyperdiverse Australian shrublands and exposed them to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota from under their own or other plant species. Plant responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal plants and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal plants. Simulations revealed that such strategy-dependent feedback is sufficient to maintain the high taxonomic and functional diversity characterizing these Mediterranean-climate shrublands. Our study identifies nutrient-acquisition strategy as a key trait explaining how different plant responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota promote local plant diversity.</p>

Plant-soil feedbacks and mycorrhizal type influence temperate forest population dynamics
<p>Feedback with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota is an important determinant of terrestrial plant diversity. However, the factors regulating plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedback, which varies from positive to negative among plant species, remain uncertain. In a large-scale study involving 55 species and 550 populations of North American trees, the type of mycorrhizal association explained much of the variation in plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedbacks. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> collected beneath conspecifics, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees experienced negative feedback, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees displayed positive feedback. Additionally, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees exhibited strong conspecific inhibition at multiple spatial scales, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees exhibited conspecific facilitation locally and less severe conspecific inhibition regionally. These results suggest that mycorrhizal type, through effects on plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedbacks, could be an important contributor to population regulation and community structure in temperate forests.</p>

Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> is the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of carbon cycle–climate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon sink by 2100, yet the underlying carbon dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used <sup>14</sup>C data from 157 globally distributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon by a factor of more than six (430 ± 50 years versus 3100 ± 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the carbon sequestration potential of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s by a factor of nearly two (40 ± 27%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent carbon stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric carbon dioxide dynamics.</p>

Faster Decomposition Under Increased Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Limits Soil Carbon Storage

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of summer droughts in the northeastern deciduous forest of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an economically important native tree species, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of allocation of biomass, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative allocation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under water deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit due to shifts in biomass allocation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under water deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative allocation of root biomass to enhance its water management.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Retrotransposon Insertion and DNA Methylation Regulate Aluminum Tolerance in European Barley Accessions
<p>Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major stress factor limiting crop productivity in acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>. Although there is great genotypic variation in tolerance to Al toxicity, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report that, in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the fourth largest cereal crop produced in the world, both retrotransposon insertion and DNA methylation are involved in regulating differential Al tolerance. <i>HvAACT1</i> is a major gene responsible for citrate secretion from the roots for external detoxification of Al. A multiretrotransposon-like (MRL) sequence insertion at least 15.3 kb in length was detected in the upstream genomic region of <i>HvAACT1</i> that displayed promoter activity and significantly enhanced <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, especially in the root tips of Al-tolerant accessions. Furthermore, in a number of accessions with low levels of <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, this MRL insertion was present but highly methylated. Geographical analysis showed that accessions with this MRL insertion are distributed mainly in European areas with acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s. Two wild barley accessions were found to possess this MRL insertion, but with a high degree of methylation. These results indicate that the MRL insertion and its degree of DNA methylation influence <i>HvAACT1</i> expression and that demethylation of this MRL insertion, which facilitates adaptation to acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s, occurred following barley domestication. Moreover, our results indicate that barley accessions in East Asia and Europe have developed independent but equivalent strategies to withstand Al toxicity in acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s.</p>

Carbon dynamics of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under drought and complete darkness
<p>Carbon (C) storage is considered a key component to plant survival under drought and shade, although the combined effects of these factors on survival remain poorly understood. We investigated how drought and shade alter the C dynamics and survival of tree seedlings, and whether drought limits the access to or usage of stored C. We experimentally applied two levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> humidity (well-watered versus drought, the latter induced by dry-down) and light availability (light versus complete darkness) on 1-year-old seedlings of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L. for 3 months. We quantified the survival, biomass, growth rate and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) of seedlings at their time of death or at the end of the experiment for those that survived. We found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> dried out faster when drought was combined with light than when it was combined with complete darkness. Seedlings subjected to both drought and light showed reduced growth and reached 100% mortality earlier than any other treatment, with the highest NSC concentrations at the time of death. Seedlings exposed to both drought and complete darkness died significantly earlier than seedlings exposed to complete darkness only, but had similar NSC concentrations at time of their death, suggesting that drought accelerated the use of stored C under complete darkness. Complete darkness significantly reduced seedling growth and whole-plant NSC concentrations regardless of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> humidity, while root NSC concentrations were significantly more reduced when complete darkness was combined with drought conditions. Thus, the C dynamics in <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under complete darkness was not hindered by drought, i.e., the access and use of stored C was not limited by drought. The contrasting growth and C storage responses driven by drought under light versus complete darkness are consistent with a key role of the drought progression in the C dynamics of trees.</p>

Microbial oxidation of lithospheric organic carbon in rapidly eroding tropical mountain soils
<p>Lithospheric organic carbon (“petrogenic”; OC<sub>petro</sub>) is oxidized during exhumation and subsequent erosion of mountain ranges. This process is a considerable source of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere over geologic time scales, but the mechanisms that govern oxidation rates in mountain landscapes are poorly constrained. We demonstrate that, on average, 67 ± 11% of the OC<sub>petro</sub> initially present in bedrock exhumed from the tropical, rapidly eroding Central Range of Taiwan is oxidized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s, leading to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 6.1 to 18.6 metric tons of carbon per square kilometer per year. The molecular and isotopic evolution of bulk OC and lipid biomarkers during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> formation reveals that OC<sub>petro</sub> remineralization is microbially mediated. Rapid oxidation in mountain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s drives CO<sub>2</sub> emission fluxes that increase with erosion rate, thereby counteracting CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown by silicate weathering and biospheric OC burial.</p>

Scopoletin 8-Hydroxylase-Mediated Fraxetin Production Is Crucial for Iron Mobilization
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral nutrient and an important factor for the composition of natural plant communities. Low Fe availability in aerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s with neutral or alkaline pH has led to the evolution of elaborate mechanisms that extract Fe from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> solution. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), Fe is acquired by an orchestrated strategy that comprises mobilization, chelation, and reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> prior to its uptake. Here, we show that At3g12900, previously annotated as scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H), participates in Fe acquisition by mediating the biosynthesis of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin), a coumarin derived from the scopoletin pathway. S8H is highly induced in roots of Fe-deficient plants both at the transcript and protein levels. Mutants defective in the expression of <i>S8H</i> showed increased sensitivity to growth on pH 7.0 media supplemented with an immobile source of Fe and reduced secretion of fraxetin. Transgenic lines overexpressing <i>S8H</i> exhibited an opposite phenotype. Homozygous <i>s8h</i> mutants grown on media with immobilized Fe accumulated significantly more scopolin, the storage form of scopoletin, supporting the designated function of S8H in scopoletin hydroxylation. Fraxetin exhibited Fe-reducing properties in vitro with higher rates being observed at neutral relative to acidic pH. Supplementing the media containing immobile Fe with fraxetin partially rescued the <i>s8h</i> mutants. In natural Arabidopsis accessions differing in their performance on media containing immobilized Fe, the amount of secreted fraxetin was highly correlated with growth and Fe and chlorophyll content, indicating that fraxetin secretion is a decisive factor for calcicole-calcifuge behavior (i.e. the ability/inability to thrive on alkaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s) of plants.</p>

Comparative Analysis of Arabidopsis Ecotypes Reveals a Role for Brassinosteroids in Root Hydrotropism
<p>Plant roots respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture gradients and remodel their growth orientation toward water through hydrotropism, a process vital for acclimation to a changing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> environment. Mechanisms underlying the root hydrotropic response, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we examined hydrotropism in 31 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ecotypes collected from different parts of the world and grown along moisture gradients in a specially designed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>-simulation system. Comparative transcriptome profiling and physiological analyses were carried out on three selected ecotypes, Wassilewskija (Ws), Columbia (Col-0) (strongly hydrotropic), Col-0 (moderately hydrotropic), and C24 (weakly hydrotropic), and in mutant lines with altered root hydrotropic responses. We show that H<sup>+</sup> efflux, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, redox homeostasis, epigenetic regulation, and phytohormone signaling may contribute to root hydrotropism. Among phytohormones, the role of brassinosteroids (BRs) was examined further. In the presence of an inhibitor of BR biosynthesis, the strong hydrotropic response observed in Ws was reduced. The root H<sup>+</sup> efflux and primary root elongation also were inhibited when compared with C24, an ecotype that showed a weak hydrotropic response. The BR-insensitive mutant <i>bri1-5</i> displayed higher rates of root growth inhibition and root curvature on moisture gradients in vertical or oblique orientation when compared with wild-type Ws. We also demonstrate that BRI1 (a BR receptor) interacts with AHA2 (a plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) and that their expression patterns are highly coordinated. This synergistic action may contribute to the strong hydrotropism observed in Ws. Our results suggest that BR-associated H<sup>+</sup> efflux is critical in the hydrotropic response of Arabidopsis roots.</p>

Implication of the suberin pathway in adaptation to waterlogging and hypertrophied lenticels formation in pedunculate oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.)
<p>Waterlogging causes stressful conditions for perennial species. The temporary overabundance of water in waterlogged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> can induce hypoxia in the rhizosphere, leading to root death, tree decline and even dieback. Two closely related members of the European white oak complex, pedunculate (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) and sessile (<i>Quercus petraea</i> Matt. Liebl.) oaks, have different ecological characteristics, especially regarding their adaptation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> waterlogging. The tolerance of waterlogging observed in pedunculate oak is driven principally by its ability to produce adaptive structures, hypertrophied lenticels and adventitious roots, and to switch rapidly its metabolism to the fermentative pathway. This study had two objectives: (i) to identify genes important for adaptation to waterlogging and (ii) to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in hypertrophied lenticel formation in pedunculate oak. We subjected seedlings of the two species to hypoxia by maintaining the water level 2 cm above the collar. The immersed part of the stem (i.e., containing hypertrophied lenticels in pedunculate oak) was sampled after 9 days of waterlogging stress and its gene expression was investigated by RNA-seq. Genes displaying differential expression between the two species were identified with the DESeq R package and a false discovery rate of 0.001. We found that 3705 contigs were differentially regulated between the two species. Twenty-two differentially expressed genes were validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The suberin biosynthesis pathway was found to be upregulated in pedunculate oak, consistent with molecular mechanisms analogous to those operating in the radial oxygen loss barrier in waterlogging-tolerant species.</p>

Sexual competition affects biomass partitioning, carbon–nutrient balance, Cd allocation and ultrastructure of <i>Populus cathayana</i> females and males exposed to Cd stress
<p>Although increasing attention has been paid to plant adaptation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> heavy metal contamination, competition and neighbor effects have been largely overlooked, especially in dioecious plants. In this study, we investigated growth as well as biochemical and ultrastructural responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder females and males to cadmium (Cd) stress under different sexual competition patterns. The results showed that competition significantly affects biomass partitioning, photosynthetic capacity, leaf and root ultrastructure, Cd accumulation, the contents of polyphenols, and structural and nonstructural carbohydrates. Compared with single-sex cultivation, plants of opposite sexes exposed to sexual competition accumulated more Cd in tissues and their growth was more strongly inhibited, indicating enhanced Cd toxicity under sexual competition. Under intrasexual competition, females showed greater Cd accumulation, more serious damage at the ultrastructural level and greater reduction in physiological activity than under intersexual competition, while males performed better under intrasexual competition than under intersexual competition. Males improved the female microenvironment by greater Cd uptake and lower resource consumption under intersexual competition. These results demonstrate that the sex of neighbor plants and competition affect sexual differences in growth and in key physiological processes under Cd stress. The asymmetry of sexual competition highlighted here might regulate population structure, and spatial segregation and phytoremediation potential of both sexes in <i>P. cathayana</i> growing in heavy metal-contaminated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s.</p>

Termites mitigate the effects of drought in tropical rainforest
<p>Termites perform key ecological functions in tropical ecosystems, are strongly affected by variation in rainfall, and respond negatively to habitat disturbance. However, it is not known how the projected increase in frequency and severity of droughts in tropical rainforests will alter termite communities and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Using a large-scale termite suppression experiment, we found that termite activity and abundance increased during drought in a Bornean forest. This increase resulted in accelerated litter decomposition, elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture, greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> nutrient heterogeneity, and higher seedling survival rates during the extreme El Niño drought of 2015–2016. Our work shows how an invertebrate group enhances ecosystem resistance to drought, providing evidence that the dual stressors of climate change and anthropogenic shifts in biotic communities will have various negative consequences for the maintenance of rainforest ecosystems.</p>

Unexpected reversal of C<sub>3</sub> versus C<sub>4</sub> grass response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> during a 20-year field experiment
<p>Theory predicts and evidence shows that plant species that use the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway (C<sub>4</sub> species) are less responsive to elevated carbon dioxide (<i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub>) than species that use only the C<sub>3</sub> pathway (C<sub>3</sub> species). We document a reversal from this expected C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> contrast. Over the first 12 years of a 20-year free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment experiment with 88 C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub> grassland plots, we found that biomass was markedly enhanced at <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> relative to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> in C<sub>3</sub> but not C<sub>4</sub> plots, as expected. During the subsequent 8 years, the pattern reversed: Biomass was markedly enhanced at <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> relative to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> in C<sub>4</sub> but not C<sub>3</sub> plots. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> net nitrogen mineralization rates, an index of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> nitrogen supply, exhibited a similar shift: <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> first enhanced but later depressed rates in C<sub>3</sub> plots, with the opposite true in C<sub>4</sub> plots, partially explaining the reversal of the <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> biomass response. These findings challenge the current C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> paradigm and show that even the best-supported short-term drivers of plant response to global change might not predict long-term results.</p>

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral ion homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffusion of ions between the root vascular bundles and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in ion homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulation is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> conditions.</p>

Linking Duplication of a Calcium Sensor to Salt Tolerance in <i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>
<p>The SALT-OVERLY-SENSITIVE (SOS) pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) functions to prevent the toxic accumulation of sodium in the cytosol when plants are grown in salt-affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s. In this pathway, the CALCINEURIN B-LIKE10 (AtCBL10) calcium sensor interacts with the AtSOS2 kinase to activate the AtSOS1 plasma membrane sodium/proton exchanger. <i>CBL10</i> has been duplicated in Eutrema (<i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>), a salt-tolerant relative of Arabidopsis. Because Eutrema maintains growth in salt-affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s that kill most crop plants, the duplication of <i>CBL10</i> provides a unique opportunity to functionally test the outcome of gene duplication and its link to plant salt tolerance. In Eutrema, individual down-regulation of the duplicated <i>CBL10</i> genes (<i>EsCBL10a</i> and <i>EsCBL10b</i>) decreased growth in the presence of salt and, in combination, led to an even greater decrease, suggesting that both genes function in response to salt and have distinct functions. Cross-species complementation assays demonstrated that <i>EsCBL10b</i> has an enhanced ability to activate the SOS pathway while <i>EsCBL10a</i> has a function not performed by <i>AtCBL10</i> or <i>EsCBL10b</i>. Chimeric EsCBL10a/EsCBL10b proteins revealed that the specific functions of the EsCBL10 proteins resulted from changes in the amino terminus. The duplication of <i>CBL10</i> increased calcium-mediated signaling capacity in Eutrema and conferred increased salt tolerance to salt-sensitive Arabidopsis.</p>

Root Engineering in Barley: Increasing Cytokinin Degradation Produces a Larger Root System, Mineral Enrichment in the Shoot and Improved Drought Tolerance
<p>Root size and architecture are important crop plant traits, as they determine access to water and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> nutrients. The plant hormone cytokinin is a negative regulator of root growth and branching. Here, we generated transgenic barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) plants with an enlarged root system by enhancing cytokinin degradation in roots to explore the potential of cytokinin modulations in improving root functions. This was achieved through root-specific expression of a <i>CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE</i> gene. Enhanced biomass allocation to roots did not penalize shoot growth or seed yield, indicating that these plants were not source limited. In leaves of transgenic lines, the concentrations of several macroelements and microelements were increased, particularly those with low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> mobility (phosphorus, manganese, and zinc). Importantly, seeds contained up to 44% more zinc, which is beneficial for human nutrition. Transgenic lines also demonstrated dampened stress responses to long-term drought conditions, indicating lower drought sensitivity. Taken together, this work demonstrates that root engineering of cereals is a promising strategy to improve nutrient efficiency, biofortification, and drought tolerance.</p>

Large Crown Root Number Improves Topsoil Foraging and Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>Suboptimal phosphorus (P) availability is a primary constraint to plant growth on Earth. We tested the hypothesis that maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) genotypes with large crown root number (CN) will have shallower rooting depth and improved P acquisition from low-P <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s. Maize recombinant inbred lines with contrasting CN were evaluated under suboptimal P availability in greenhouse mesocosms and the field. Under P stress in mesocosms, the large-CN phenotype had 48% greater root respiration, 24% shallower rooting depth, 32% greater root length density in the top<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>, 37% greater leaf P concentration, 48% greater leaf photosynthesis, 33% greater stomatal conductance, and 44% greater shoot biomass than the small-CN phenotype. Under P stress in the field, the large-CN phenotype had 32% shallower rooting depth, 51% greater root length density in the top<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>, 44% greater leaf P concentration, 18% greater leaf photosynthesis, 21% greater stomatal conductance, 23% greater shoot biomass at anthesis, and 28% greater yield than the small-CN phenotype. These results support the hypothesis that large CN improves plant P acquisition from low-P <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s by reducing rooting depth and increasing top<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> foraging. The large-CN phenotype merits consideration as a selection target to improve P capture in maize and possibly other cereal crops.</p>

Reduction in Root Secondary Growth as a Strategy for Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>We tested the hypothesis that reduced root secondary growth of dicotyledonous species improves phosphorus acquisition. Functional-structural modeling in SimRoot indicates that, in common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), reduced root secondary growth reduces root metabolic costs, increases root length, improves phosphorus capture, and increases shoot biomass in low-phosphorus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>. Observations from the field and greenhouse confirm that, under phosphorus stress, resource allocation is shifted from secondary to primary root growth, genetic variation exists for this response, and reduced secondary growth improves phosphorus capture from low-phosphorus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>. Under low phosphorus in greenhouse mesocosms, genotypes with reduced secondary growth had 39% smaller root cross-sectional area, 60% less root respiration, 27% greater root length, 78% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 68% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary growth. In the field under low phosphorus, these genotypes had 43% smaller root cross-sectional area, 32% greater root length, 58% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 80% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary growth. Secondary growth eliminated arbuscular mycorrhizal associations as cortical tissue was destroyed. These results support the hypothesis that reduced root secondary growth is an adaptive response to low phosphorus availability and merits investigation as a potential breeding target.</p>

Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water logging or flooding, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited oxygen supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic oxygen, they are rapidly faced with oxygen shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low oxygen conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low oxygen environment, possibly to escape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> patches with reduced oxygen availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an auxin gradient across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the root tip.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient availability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

Quantifying Wheat Sensitivities to Environmental Constraints to Dissect Genotype × Environment Interactions in the Field
<p>Yield is subject to strong genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions in the field, especially under abiotic constraints such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit (drought [D]) and high temperature (heat [H]). Since environmental conditions show strong fluctuations during the whole crop cycle, geneticists usually do not consider environmental measures as quantitative variables but rather as factors in multienvironment analyses. Based on 11 experiments in a field platform with contrasting temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to drought and heat constraints in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components. G × E interactions were separated into their underlying components, constitutive genotypic effect (G), G × D, G × H, and G × H × D, and were analyzed for two genotypes, highlighting contrasting responses to heat and drought constraints. We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviors of two strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated previously with yield components. This analysis confirmed the constitutive effect of the chromosome 1B QTL and explained the G × E interaction of the chromosome 3B QTL by a benefit of one allele when temperature rises. In addition to the method itself, which can be applied to other data sets and populations, this study will support the cloning of a major yield QTL on chromosome 3B that is highly dependent on environmental conditions and for which the climatic interaction is now quantified.</p>

Stress-Related Gene Expression Reflects Morphophysiological Responses to Water Deficit
<p>Acclimation to water deficit (WD) enables plants to maintain growth under unfavorable environmental conditions, although the mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, the natural variation of long-term acclimation to moderate and severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> WD was investigated in 18 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions using PHENOPSIS, an automated phenotyping platform. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water content was adjusted at an early stage of plant development and maintained at a constant level until reproductive age was achieved. The accessions were selected based on the expression levels of <i>ANNEXIN1</i>, a drought-related marker. Severe WD conditions had a greater effect on most of the measured morphophysiological traits than moderate WD conditions. Multivariate analyses indicated that trait responses associated with plant size and water management drove most of the variation. Accessions with similar responses at these two levels were grouped in clusters that displayed different response strategies to WD. The expression levels of selected stress-response genes revealed large natural variation under WD conditions. Responses of morphophysiological traits, such as projected rosette area, transpiration rate, and rosette water content, were correlated with changes in the expression of stress-related genes, such as <i>NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3</i> and <i>N-MYC DOWNREGULATED-LIKE1</i> (<i>NDL1</i>), in response to WD. Interestingly, the morphophysiological acclimation response to WD also was reflected in the gene expression levels (most notably those of <i>NDL1</i>, <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i>, and <i>MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN44</i>) in plants cultivated under well-watered conditions. Our results may lead to the development of biomarkers and predictors of plant morphophysiological responses based on gene expression patterns.</p>

OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 Function as Arsenate Reductases and Regulate Arsenic Accumulation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Rice is a major dietary source of the toxic metalloid arsenic (As). Reducing its accumulation in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) grain is of critical importance to food safety. Rice roots take up arsenate and arsenite depending on the prevailing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> conditions. The first step of arsenate detoxification is its reduction to arsenite, but the enzyme(s) catalyzing this reaction in rice remains unknown. Here, we identify OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 as arsenate reductases in rice. <i>OsHAC1;1</i> and <i>OsHAC1;2</i> are able to complement an <i>Escherichia coli</i> mutant lacking the endogenous arsenate reductase and to reduce arsenate to arsenite. <i>OsHAC1:1</i> and <i>OsHAC1;2</i> are predominantly expressed in roots, with <i>OsHAC1;1</i> being abundant in the epidermis, root hairs, and pericycle cells while <i>OsHAC1;2</i> is abundant in the epidermis, outer layers of cortex, and endodermis cells. Expression of the two genes was induced by arsenate exposure. Knocking out <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> decreased the reduction of arsenate to arsenite in roots, reducing arsenite efflux to the external medium. Loss of arsenite efflux was also associated with increased As accumulation in shoots. Greater effects were observed in a double mutant of the two genes. In contrast, overexpression of either <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> increased arsenite efflux, reduced As accumulation, and enhanced arsenate tolerance. When grown under aerobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> conditions, overexpression of either <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> also decreased As accumulation in rice grain, whereas grain As increased in the knockout mutants. We conclude that OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 are arsenate reductases that play an important role in restricting As accumulation in rice shoots and grain.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems perform the crucial task of absorbing water from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of drought stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that drought-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine root cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine root hydraulic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate drought stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild drought stress (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased drought stress was embolism formation observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the fine roots (50% loss of hydraulic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine roots function like hydraulic fuses that decouple plants from drying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>, thus preserving the hydraulic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of drought stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine root mortality and turnover under drought stress.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant systemic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two systemic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts systemically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 systemic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor systemic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN systemic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

SULTR3s Function in Chloroplast Sulfate Uptake and Affect ABA Biosynthesis and the Stress Response
<p>Plants are major sulfur reducers in the global sulfur cycle. Sulfate, the major natural sulfur source in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>, is absorbed by plant roots and transported into plastids, where it is reduced and assimilated into Cys for further metabolic processes. Despite its importance, how sulfate is transported into plastids is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated using single Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genetic mutants that each member of the sulfate transporter (SULTR) subfamily 3 was able to transport sulfate across the chloroplast envelope membrane. To resolve the function of SULTR3s, we constructed a <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant completely knocking out all five members of the subfamily. Here we report that all members of the <i>SULTR3</i> subfamily show chloroplast membrane localization. Sulfate uptake by chloroplasts of the quintuple mutant is reduced by more than 50% compared with the wild type. Consequently, Cys and abscisic acid (ABA) content are reduced to ∼67 and ∼20% of the wild-type level, respectively, and strong positive correlations are found among sulfate, Cys, and ABA content. The <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant shows obvious growth retardation with smaller rosettes and shorter roots. Seed germination of the <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and salt stress, but is rescued by sulfide supplementation. Furthermore, sulfate-induced stomatal closure is abolished in the quintuple mutant, strongly suggesting that chloroplast sulfate is required for stomatal closure. Our genetic analyses unequivocally demonstrate that sulfate transporter subfamily 3 is responsible for more than half of the chloroplast sulfate uptake and influences downstream sulfate assimilation and ABA biosynthesis.</p>

Phosphate Starvation Alters Abiotic-Stress-Induced Cytosolic Free Calcium Increases in Roots
<p>Phosphate (Pi) deficiency strongly limits plant growth, and plant roots foraging the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> for nutrients need to adapt to optimize Pi uptake. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is known to signal in root development and adaptation but has to be tightly controlled, as it is highly toxic to Pi metabolism. Under Pi starvation and the resulting decreased cellular Pi pool, the use of cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) as a signal transducer may therefore have to be altered. Employing aequorin-expressing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we show that Pi starvation, but not nitrogen starvation, strongly dampens the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> increases evoked by mechanical, salt, osmotic, and oxidative stress as well as by extracellular nucleotides. The altered root [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response to extracellular ATP manifests during seedling development under chronic Pi deprivation but can be reversed by Pi resupply. Employing ratiometric imaging, we delineate that Pi-starved roots have a normal response to extracellular ATP at the apex but show a strongly dampened [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response in distal parts of the root tip, correlating with high reactive oxygen species levels induced by Pi starvation. Excluding iron, as well as Pi, rescues this altered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response and restores reactive oxygen species levels to those seen under nutrient-replete conditions. These results indicate that, while Pi availability does not seem to be signaled through [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>, Pi starvation strongly affects stress-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> signatures. These data reveal how plants can integrate nutritional and environmental cues, adding another layer of complexity to the use of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a signal transducer.</p>

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p>Water discharge from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of vessel cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that water storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under drought stress, and potentially refill after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels releases stored water and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive drought stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely water-filled even under severe drought stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce water release from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that water release from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem water potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of water stored in the xylem matrix is released after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary water contributes to overall stem water storage under drought but is not used primarily for the prevention of drought-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

A Simple Method for Measuring Apoplast Hydration and Collecting Apoplast Contents
<p>The plant leaf apoplast is a dynamic environment subject to a variety of both internal and external stimuli. In addition to being a conduit for water vapor and gas exchange involved in transpiration and photosynthesis, the apoplast also accumulates many nutrients transported from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> as well as those produced through photosynthesis. The internal leaf also provides a protective environment for endophytic and pathogenic microbes alike. Given the diverse array of physiological processes occurring in the apoplast, it is expedient to develop methods to study its contents. Many established methods rely on vacuum infiltration of an apoplast wash solution followed by centrifugation. In this study, we describe a refined method optimized for maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seedling leaves, which not only provides a simple procedure for obtaining apoplast fluid, but also allows direct calculation of apoplast hydration at the time of harvest for every sample. In addition, we describe an abbreviated method for estimating apoplast hydration if the full apoplast extraction is not necessary. Finally, we show the applicability of this optimized apoplast extraction procedure for plants infected with the maize pathogen <i>Pantoea stewartii</i> ssp <i>stewartii</i>, including the efficient isolation of bacteria previously residing in the apoplast. The approaches to establishing this method should make it generally applicable to other types of plants.</p>

OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation, and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes
<p>Plant roots rely on inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) transporters to acquire soluble Pi from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> solutions that exists at micromolar levels in natural ecosystems. Here, we functionally characterized a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) Pi transporter, Os Phosphate Transporter-1;3 (OsPHT1;3), that mediates Pi uptake, translocation, and remobilization. <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was directly regulated by Os Phosphate Starvation Response-2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades. OsPHT1;3 was able to complement a yeast mutant strain defective in five Pi transporters and mediate Pi influx in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. Overexpression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots. However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members that facilitate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation only when external Pi concentration was below 5 μ<sc>m</sc>. Moreover, in basal nodes, the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was restricted to the phloem of regular vascular bundles and enlarged vascular bundles. An isotope labeling experiment with <sup>32</sup>P showed that <i>ospht1</i>;<i>3</i> mutant lines were impaired in remobilization of Pi from source to sink leaves. Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>2</i> and several other <i>OsPHT1</i> genes. Yeast-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated a physical interaction between OsPHT1;3 and OsPHT1;2. Taken together, our results indicate that OsPHT1;3 acts as a crucial factor for Pi acquisition, root-to-shoot Pi translocation, and redistribution of phosphorus in plants growing in environments with extremely low Pi levels.</p>

GhCPK33 Negatively Regulates Defense against <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> by Phosphorylating GhOPR3
<p><i>Verticillium</i> wilt, caused by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>-borne fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, is a destructive vascular disease in plants. Approximately 200 dicotyledonous plant species in temperate and subtropical regions are susceptible to this notorious pathogen. Previous studies showed that jasmonic acid (JA) plays a crucial role in plant-<i>V. dahliae</i> interactions. <i>V. dahliae</i> infection generally induces significant JA accumulation in local and distal tissues of the plant. Although JA biosynthesis and the associated enzymes have been studied intensively, the precise mechanism regulating JA biosynthesis upon <i>V. dahliae</i> infection remains unknown. Here, we identified the calcium-dependent protein kinase GhCPK33 from upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) as a negative regulator of resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> that directly manipulates JA biosynthesis. Knockdown of <i>GhCPK33</i> by <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated virus-induced gene silencing constitutively activated JA biosynthesis and JA-mediated defense responses and enhanced resistance to <i>V</i>. <i>dahliae</i>. Further analysis revealed that GhCPK33 interacts with 12-oxophytodienoate reductase3 (GhOPR3) in peroxisomes. GhCPK33 phosphorylates GhOPR3 at threonine-246, leading to decreased stability of GhOPR3, which consequently limits JA biosynthesis. We propose that GhCPK33 is a potential molecular target for improving resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt disease in cotton.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p>Plant growth and water use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving plant water use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance agricultural sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify plant size and water use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-watered and water-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of plant size and water use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of plant size given water use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing plant size, water use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of plant WUE under different watering treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Inhibits Auxin-Induced Lateral Rooting Independently of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 Receptor
<p>Plant root systems are indispensable for water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and anchoring plants in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>. Previous studies using auxin inhibitors definitively established that auxin plays a central role regulating root growth and development. Most auxin inhibitors affect all auxin signaling at the same time, which obscures an understanding of individual events. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a lateral root (LR)-preferential auxin inhibitor in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in a manner that is independent of the JA receptor, CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1). Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with either (−)-JA or (+)-JA reduced primary root length and LR number; the reduction of LR number was also observed in <i>coi1</i> mutants. Treatment of seedlings with (−)-JA or (+)-JA suppressed auxin-inducible genes related to LR formation, diminished accumulation of the auxin reporter <i>DR5::GUS</i>, and inhibited auxin-dependent DII-VENUS degradation. A structural mimic of (−)-JA and (+)-coronafacic acid also inhibited LR formation and stabilized DII-VENUS protein. COI1-independent activity was retained in the double mutant of <i>transport inhibitor response1</i> and <i>auxin signaling f-box protein2</i> (<i>tir1 afb2</i>) but reduced in the <i>afb5</i> single mutant. These results reveal JAs and (+)-coronafacic acid to be selective counter-auxins, a finding that could lead to new approaches for studying the mechanisms of LR formation.</p>

Stable Accumulation of Photosystem II Requires ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) of the Light Harvesting-Like Family
<p>The cellular functions of two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) one-helix proteins, OHP1 and OHP2 (also named LIGHT-HARVESTING-LIKE2 [LIL2] and LIL6, respectively, because they have sequence similarity to light-harvesting chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>-binding proteins), remain unclear. Tagged null mutants of <i>OHP1</i> and <i>OHP2</i> (<i>ohp1</i> and <i>ohp2</i>) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane proteins revealed that <i>ohp1</i> deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core protein function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core proteins; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic <i>ohp1</i> plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc proteins developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 proteins in transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid membranes, where it formed protein complexes with both OHP2 and High Chlorophyll Fluorescence244 (HCF244). We also found PSII core proteins D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other plant-specific proteins associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly. OHP1 interacted directly with HCF244 in the complex. Therefore, OHP1 and HCF244 play important roles in the stable accumulation of PSII.</p>

DELLA1-Mediated Gibberellin Signaling Regulates Cytokinin-Dependent Symbiotic Nodulation
<p>In legume plants, low-nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s promote symbiotic interactions with rhizobial bacteria, leading to the formation of nitrogen-fixing root nodules. Among critical signals regulating this developmental process are bacterial Nod Factors (NFs) and several plant hormones, including cytokinins (CKs) and gibberellins (GAs). Here, we show in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> that GA signaling mediated by DELLA1 decreases the amount of bioactive CKs in roots and negatively impacts the Cytokinin Response1 (CRE1)-dependent NF activation of a subset of CK-signaling genes as well as of the CK-regulated <i>Nodulation Signaling Pathway2</i> and <i>Ethylene Response Factor Required for Nodulation1</i> early nodulation genes. Consistently, a dominant-active DELLA1 protein can partially rescue the reduced nodulation of the <i>cre1</i> mutant and triggers the formation of nodule-like structures when expressed in the root cortex or in the root epidermis. This suggests a model where the DELLA1-mediated GA signaling interplays with the CRE1-dependent CK pathway to regulate early nodulation in response to both NF and CK signals critical for this symbiotic interaction.</p>

The Nitrate Transporter Family Protein LjNPF8.6 Controls the N-Fixing Nodule Activity
<p>N-fixing nodules are new organs formed on legume roots as a result of the beneficial interaction with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> bacteria, rhizobia. The nodule functioning is still a poorly characterized step of the symbiotic interaction, as only a few of the genes induced in N-fixing nodules have been functionally characterized. We present here the characterization of a member of the <i>Lotus japonicus</i> nitrate transporter1/peptide transporter family, <i>LjNPF8.6</i>. The phenotypic characterization carried out in independent <i>L. japonicus</i> LORE1 insertion lines indicates a positive role of LjNPF8.6 on nodule functioning, as knockout mutants display N-fixation deficiency (25%) and increased nodular superoxide content. The partially compromised nodule functioning induces two striking phenotypes: anthocyanin accumulation already displayed 4 weeks after inoculation and shoot biomass deficiency, which is detected by long-term phenotyping. LjNPF8.6 achieves nitrate uptake in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes at both 0.5 and 30 m<sc>m</sc> external concentrations, and a possible role as a nitrate transporter in the control of N-fixing nodule activity is discussed</p>

Abscisic Acid Down-Regulates Hydraulic Conductance of Grapevine Leaves in Isohydric Genotypes Only<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants evolved different strategies to cope with water stress. While isohydric species maintain their midday leaf water potential (Ψ<sub>M</sub>) under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit by closing their stomata, anisohydric species maintain higher stomatal aperture and exhibit substantial reductions in Ψ<sub>M</sub>. It was hypothesized that isohydry is related to a locally higher sensitivity of stomata to the drought-hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Interestingly, recent lines of evidence in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) suggested that stomatal responsiveness is also controlled by an ABA action on leaf water supply upstream from stomata. Here, we tested the possibility in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) that different genotypes ranging from near isohydric to more anisohydric may have different sensitivities in these ABA responses. Measurements on whole plants in drought conditions were combined with assays on detached leaves fed with ABA. Two different methods consistently showed that leaf hydraulic conductance (K<sub>leaf</sub>) was down-regulated by exogenous ABA, with strong variations depending on the genotype. Importantly, variation between isohydry and anisohydry correlated with K<sub>leaf</sub> sensitivity to ABA, with K<sub>leaf</sub> in the most anisohydric genotypes being unresponsive to the hormone. We propose that the observed response of K<sub>leaf</sub> to ABA may be part of the overall ABA regulation of leaf water status.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

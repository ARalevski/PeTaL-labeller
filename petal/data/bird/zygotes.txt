Female Mice With an XY Sex Chromosome Complement Develop Severe Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a deadly pathology with strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphism. Similar to humans, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mice exhibit far lower incidences of angiotensin II–induced AAAs than males. In addition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> hormones, the X and Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes, and their unique complements of genes, may contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ually dimorphic AAA pathology. Here, we defined the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e (XX) versus male (XY) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome complement on angiotensin II–induced AAA formation and rupture in phenotypically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e low-density lipoprotein receptor (<i>Ldlr</i>) deficient mice with an XX or XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome complement were infused with angiotensin II for 28 days to induce AAAs. Abdominal aortic lumen diameters were quantified by ultrasound, whereas AAA diameters were quantified at study end point. DNA microarrays were performed on abdominal aortas. To mimic males, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mice were administered a single dose of testosterone as neonates or as adults before angiotensin II infusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e <i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup> deficient mice with an XX and XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome complement had similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> organ weights and low serum testosterone concentrations. Abdominal aortas from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e XY mice selectively expressed Y chromosome genes, whereas genes known to escape X inactivation were higher in XX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. The majority of aortic gene differences in XY versus XX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es fell within inflammatory pathways. AAA incidences doubled and aneurysms ruptured in XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. AAAs from XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es exhibited inflammation, and plasma interleukin-1β concentrations were increased in XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Moreover, aortas from XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es had augmented matrix metalloproteinase activity and increased oxidative stress. Last, testosterone exposure applied chronically, or as a single bolus at postnatal day 1, markedly worsened AAA outcomes in XY in comparison with XX adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome complement in phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es profoundly influenced aortic gene expression profiles and promoted AAA severity. When XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es were exposed to testosterone, aneurysm rupture rates were striking. Mechanisms for augmented AAA severity in XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es include increased inflammation, augmented matrix metalloproteineases, and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that genes on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes regulate aortic vascular biology and contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphism of AAAs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome genes may serve as novel targets for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific AAA therapeutics.</p></sec>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering plants, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte controls pollen tube reception immediately before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization and regulates seed development immediately after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for pollen tube reception by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization and the initiation of seed development after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>, and central cells of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte and in the zygote and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the developing seeds was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old seedlings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in pollen or pollen tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in seeds. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in seeds, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of seed development. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization and supported the model that a passage through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in seeds and controls early seed development.</p>

Males exhibit competitive advantages over females of <i>Populus deltoides</i> under salinity stress
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition among dioecious plants affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> ratios and the spatial distribution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es in different environments. At present, little is known about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphisms induced by different competition patterns under salinity stress. We employed <i>Populus deltoides</i> as a model to investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-related growth as well as physiological and biochemical responses to salinity stress under conditions of intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual and inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. Potted seedlings (two seedlings per pot; two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, two males, or one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e and one male) were exposed to two salt levels (0 and 50 mM NaCl) and salinity- and competition-driven differences in growth, assimilation rate, water use, contents of leaf pigments and osmotica, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and antioxidant enzyme and nitrate reductase activity were examined. In the absence of salinity, no significant differences in competitive ability between males and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es subjected to intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition were observed, although the growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es was moderately greater under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. The salinity treatment significantly increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in competitive ability, especially under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. Under salinity stress, males showed decreased height, but displayed greater capacity for osmotic adjustment, enhancement of long-term water-use efficiency and increase in antioxidant enzyme activities. The absolute values of these traits were greater in salt-stressed males than in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. In addition, salt-stressed males accumulated less Cl<sup>−</sup> and had lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. These data collectively demonstrate that the competitive advantage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es in non-stressed conditions is lost under salinity. Greater salinity resistance of males growing intermixed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es under salt stress can importantly affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> ratio of <i>P. deltoides</i> populations.</p>

The Ly6/uPAR protein Bouncer is necessary and sufficient for species-specific fertilization
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization is fundamental for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual reproduction, yet its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We found that an oocyte-expressed Ly6/uPAR protein, which we call Bouncer, is a crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization factor in zebrafish. Membrane-bound Bouncer mediates sperm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> binding and is thus essential for sperm entry into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>. Remarkably, Bouncer not only is required for sperm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> interaction but is also sufficient to allow cross-species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization between zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that diverged more than 200 million years ago. Our study thus identifies Bouncer as a key determinant of species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization in fish. Bouncer’s closest homolog in tetrapods, SPACA4, is restricted to the male germline in internally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>izing vertebrates, which suggests that our findings in fish have relevance to human biology.</p>

Production of all female progeny: evidence for the presence of the male sex determination factor on the Y chromosome
<p>The red flour beetle, <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>, follows an XX (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e) and XY (male) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination system. Maternal supply of the protein Transformer (Tra) is required for XX insects to follow the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pathway. The nature and source of the signal that regulates male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination in XY beetles are not known. Parental RNAi-aided knockdown in expression of <i>tra</i> masculinizes genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es (XX) that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>e. The virgin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es mated with these masculinized genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es produced all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e progeny. We present the genetic evidence to show that the factor responsible for male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination is present on the Y chromosome. These data also suggest that the Y chromosome in <i>T. castaneum</i> is not required for male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ity.</p>

Molecular Characterization and Evolution of a Gene Family Encoding Both Female- and Male-Specific Reproductive Proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new reproductive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>. To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive genes that become “co-opted” by males, we screened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive genes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in males that is transferred to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated genes that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the male RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and gene expression analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy gene that was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved male-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each gene in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-expressed gene is essential for full fecundity, and both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-expressed genes contribute singly or in combination to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the male-expressed paralog had no significant effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this gene family exert effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es by acting on a common, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-expressed target. After duplication and male co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> or species with the leg coloration of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male recognition template for conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e, but that contained a subset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-like features, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes. A male-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Female Sex Is a Risk Modifier Rather Than a Risk Factor for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation

CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were calculated for men and women, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry.

The histone demethylase KDM6B regulates temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species
<p>Temperature-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination is a notable model of phenotypic plasticity. In many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> (<i>T. scripta</i>), the individual’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> is determined by the ambient temperature during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> incubation.

KDM6B directly promotes the transcription of the male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-determining gene <i>Dmrt1</i> by eliminating the trimethylation of H3K27 near its promoter. Additionally, overexpression of <i>Dmrt1</i> is sufficient to rescue the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> reversal induced by disruption of <i>Kdm6b</i>. This study establishes causality and a direct genetic link between epigenetic mechanisms and temperature-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination in a turtle species.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional differentiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes and is thus a crucial step in the process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y chromosome and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which diverged from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes based on comparative analyses of these divergent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both chromosome-wide differentiation patterns and phylogenetic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes were extensively differentiated before the divergence of these lineages. In contrast, genetic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes. Chromosomal regions exhibiting genetic differentiation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gamete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ity of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>e gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>e gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive barriers.</p>

Sexually different physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> to nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies
<p>Previous studies have shown that there are significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual differences in the morphological and physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder under stressful conditions. However, little is known about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific differences in responses to nutrient deficiencies. In this study, the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deficiencies on the morphological, physiological and chloroplast ultrastructural traits of <i>P. cathayana</i> males and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es were investigated. The results showed that N and P deficiencies significantly decreased plant growth, foliar N and P contents, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, and instantaneous photosynthetic N- and P-use efficiencies (PNUE and PPUE) in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es. Males had higher photosynthesis, higher PNUE and PPUE rates, and a lower accumulation of plastoglobules in chloroplasts than did <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es when exposed to N- and P-deficiency conditions. Nitrogen-deficient males had higher glutamate dehydrogenase and peroxidase activities, and a more intact chloroplast ultrastructure, but less starch accumulation than did N-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Phosphorus-deficient males had higher nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase and acid phosphatase activities, but a lower foliar N : P ratio and less PSII damage than did P-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. These results suggest that N and P deficiencies cause greater negative effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es than on males, and that the different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es of <i>P. cathayana</i> may employ different strategies to cope with N and P deficiencies.</p>

Competing chromosomes explain junk DNA
<p>The vast majority of eukaryotes have two copies of each chromosome and reproduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ually. Meiosis is a vital process that produces gametes (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>s and sperm) by reducing the number of chromosome copies to one; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> and sperm restores the chromosome copy number to two. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e meiosis, one set of chromosomes is expelled into a tiny cell called a polar body, whereas the other is segregated into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>. It is a fundamental tenet of genetics that there is a random, 50% chance for any particular chromosome to be segregated into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> versus the polar body. However, cases in which one copy of a chromosome is inherited with greater than 50% frequency have been reported in many species (<i>1</i>), but the molecular mechanism of this preferential inheritance has remained obscure. Recent work has indicated that centromeres, the chromosomal regions that form attachments to microtubules that mediate chromosome segregation during meiosis, compete with each other for inheritance during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e meiosis (<i>2</i>). Thus, the essential DNA sequences that mediate accurate chromosome segregation are actually “selfish” (or parasitic) genetic elements that have invaded our genome. On page 668 of this issue, Akera <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) provide the most detailed molecular mechanism to date that explains how a parasitic DNA sequence has used the asymmetry of oocyte meiosis to ensure its own inheritance and therefore its spread through populations.</p>

Avian egg shape: Form, function, and evolution
<p>Avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> shape is generally explained as an adaptation to life history, yet we currently lack a global synthesis of how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>-shape differences arise and evolve. Here, we apply morphometric, mechanistic, and macroevolutionary analyses to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> shapes of 1400 bird species. We characterize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>-shape diversity in terms of two biologically relevant variables, asymmetry and ellipticity, allowing us to quantify the observed morphologies in a two-dimensional morphospace. We then propose a simple mechanical model that explains the observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>-shape diversity based on geometric and material properties of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> membrane. Finally, using phylogenetic models, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> shape correlates with flight ability on broad taxonomic scales, suggesting that adaptations for flight may have been critical drivers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>-shape variation in birds.</p>

Male sex in houseflies is determined by <i>Mdmd</i>, a paralog of the generic splice factor gene <i>CWC22</i>
<p>Across species, animals have diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination pathways, each consisting of a hierarchical cascade of genes and its associated regulatory mechanism. Houseflies have a distinctive polymorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination system in which a dominant male determiner, the M-factor, can reside on any of the chromosomes. We identified a gene, <i>Musca domestica</i> <i>male determiner</i> (<i>Mdmd</i>), as the M-factor. <i>Mdmd</i> originated from a duplication of the spliceosomal factor gene <i>CWC22</i> (<i>nucampholin</i>). Targeted <i>Mdmd</i> disruption results in complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> reversal to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es because of a shift from male to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e expression of the downstream genes <i>transformer</i> and <i>double<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong></i>. The presence of <i>Mdmd</i> on different chromosomes indicates that <i>Mdmd</i> translocated to different genomic sites. Thus, an instructive signal in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination can arise by duplication and neofunctionalization of an essential splicing regulator.</p>

Sexual competition affects biomass partitioning, carbon–nutrient balance, Cd allocation and ultrastructure of <i>Populus cathayana</i> females and males exposed to Cd stress
<p>Although increasing attention has been paid to plant adaptation to soil heavy metal contamination, competition and neighbor effects have been largely overlooked, especially in dioecious plants. In this study, we investigated growth as well as biochemical and ultrastructural responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es and males to cadmium (Cd) stress under different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition patterns. The results showed that competition significantly affects biomass partitioning, photosynthetic capacity, leaf and root ultrastructure, Cd accumulation, the contents of polyphenols, and structural and nonstructural carbohydrates. Compared with single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> cultivation, plants of opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es exposed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition accumulated more Cd in tissues and their growth was more strongly inhibited, indicating enhanced Cd toxicity under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. Under intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es showed greater Cd accumulation, more serious damage at the ultrastructural level and greater reduction in physiological activity than under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition, while males performed better under intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition than under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. Males improved the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e microenvironment by greater Cd uptake and lower resource consumption under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. These results demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> of neighbor plants and competition affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual differences in growth and in key physiological processes under Cd stress.

Cysteine-rich peptides promote interspecific genetic isolation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Reproductive isolation is a prerequisite for speciation. Failure of communication between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e tissues of the pistil and paternal pollen tubes imposes hybridization barriers in flowering plants. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> LURE1 (AtLURE1) peptides and their male receptor PRK6 aid attraction of the growing pollen tube to the ovule. Here, we report that the knockout of the entire <i>AtLURE1</i> gene family did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ity, indicating that AtLURE1-PRK6–mediated signaling is not required for successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization within one <i>Arabidopsis</i> species. AtLURE1s instead function as pollen tube emergence accelerators that favor conspecific pollen over pollen from other species and thus promote reproductive isolation. We also identified maternal peptides XIUQIU1 to -4, which attract pollen tubes regardless of species. Cooperation between ovule attraction and pollen tube growth acceleration favors conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization and promotes reproductive isolation.</p>

Elimination of the male reproductive tract in the female embryo is promoted by COUP-TFII in mice
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual differentiation paradigm contends that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pattern of the reproductive system is established by default because the male reproductive tracts (Wolffian ducts) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e degenerate owing to a lack of androgen. Here, we discovered that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s lacking <i>Coup-tfII</i> (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II) in the Wolffian duct mesenchyme became inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>—possessing both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e and male reproductive tracts. Retention of Wolffian ducts was not caused by ectopic androgen production or action. Instead, enhanced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in Wolffian duct epithelium was responsible for the retention of male structures in an androgen-independent manner. We thus suggest that elimination of Wolffian ducts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s is actively promoted by COUP-TFII, which suppresses a mesenchyme-epithelium cross-talk responsible for Wolffian duct maintenance.</p>

<i>ESA1</i> Is Involved in Embryo Sac Abortion in Interspecific Hybrid Progeny of Rice
<p>The emergence of sterile individuals in the hybrid backcross progeny of wild and cultivated rice limits the use of wild rice alleles for improving cultivated rice, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this sterility remain unclear. Here, we identified the semisterile introgression line YIL42, derived from a cross between the <i>indica</i> rice variety Teqing (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Oryza rufipogon</i> accession YJCWR (Yuanjiang common wild rice), which exhibits semisterility. Using positional cloning, we isolated <i>EMBRYO SAC ABORTION 1</i> (<i>ESA1</i>), which encodes a nuclear-membrane localized protein containing an armadillo repeat domain. A mutation in <i>ESA1</i> at position 1819 (<sup>T</sup>1819<sup>C</sup>) converts a stop codon into an Arg (R) codon, causing delayed termination of protein translation. Analysis of transgenic lines indicated that the difference in ESA1 protein structure between <i>O. rufipogon</i>–derived <i>ESA1</i> and Teqing-derived <i>esa1</i> affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gamete abortion during early mitosis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ity investigation and expression analysis indicated that the interaction between <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> and unknown gene(s) of Teqing affects spikelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ity of the hybrid backcross progeny. The <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> allele is present in <i>O. rufipogon</i> but absent in <i>O. sativa</i>, suggesting that variation in <i>ESA1</i> may be associated with interspecific hybrid incompatibility between wild and cultivated rice. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e sterility, which is useful for improving the panicle seed setting rate of rice and for developing a strategy to overcome interspecific hybrid sterility between cultivated rice and wild rice.</p>

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct vegetative and zygotic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

Artemin, a diapause-specific chaperone, contributes to the stress tolerance of <i>Artemia franciscana</i> cysts and influences their release from females

The encysted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s enter diapause, a state of greatly reduced metabolism and profound stress tolerance. Artemin, a diapause-specific ferritin homolog in cysts has molecular chaperone activity <i>in vitro</i>. Artemin represents 7.2% of soluble protein in cysts, approximately equal to the amount of p26, a small heat shock protein. However, there is almost twice as much artemin mRNA in cysts as compared with p26 mRNA, suggesting that artemin mRNA is translated less efficiently. RNA interference employing the injection of artemin double-stranded RNA into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> sacs of <i>A. franciscana</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es substantially reduced artemin mRNA and protein in cysts. Decreasing artemin diminished desiccation and freezing tolerance of cysts, demonstrating a role for this protein in stress resistance. Knockdown of artemin increased the time required for complete discharge of a brood of cysts carried within a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e from a few hours up to 4 days, an effect weakened in successive broods. Artemin, an abundant molecular chaperone, contributes to stress tolerance of <i>A. franciscana</i> cysts while influencing their development and/or exit from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es.</p>

Autologous grafting of cryopreserved prepubertal rhesus testis produces sperm and offspring
<p>Testicular tissue cryopreservation is an experimental method to preserve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ity of prepubertal patients before they initiate gonadotoxic therapies for cancer or other conditions. Here we provide the proof of principle that cryopreserved prepubertal testicular tissues can be autologously grafted under the back skin or scrotal skin of castrated pubertal rhesus macaques and matured to produce functional sperm. During the 8- to 12-month observation period, grafts grew and produced testosterone. Complete spermatogenesis was confirmed in all grafts at the time of recovery. Graft-derived sperm were competent to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ize rhesus oocytes, leading to preimplantation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong> development, pregnancy, and the birth of a healthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e baby. Pending the demonstration that similar results are obtained in noncastrated recipients, testicular tissue grafting may be applied in the clinic.</p>

Egg accumulation with 3D embryos provides insight into the life history of a pterosaur
<p>Fossil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s that provide unique information about the reproduction and early growth of vertebrates are exceedingly rare, particularly for pterosaurs. Here we report on hundreds of three-dimensional (3D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>s of the species <i>Hamipterus tianshanensis</i> from a Lower Cretaceous site in China, 16 of which contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>nic remains. Computed tomography scanning, osteohistology, and micropreparation reveal that some bones lack extensive ossification in potentially late-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s, suggesting that hatchlings might have been flightless and less precocious than previously assumed. The geological context, including at least four levels with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>s, indicates that this deposit was formed by a rare combination of events, with storms acting on a nesting ground. This discovery supports colonial nesting behavior and potential nesting site fidelity in the Pterosauria.</p>

Assembly of embryonic and extraembryonic stem cells to mimic embryogenesis in vitro
<p>Mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>genesis requires intricate interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>nic and extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>nic tissues to orchestrate and coordinate morphogenesis with changes in developmental potential. Here, we combined mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>nic stem cells (ESCs) and extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>nic trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) in a three-dimensional scaffold to generate structures whose morphogenesis is markedly similar to that of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s. By using genetically modified stem cells and specific inhibitors, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>genesis of ESC- and TSC-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s—ETS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s—depends on cross-talk involving Nodal signaling.

SEIPIN Proteins Mediate Lipid Droplet Biogenesis to Promote Pollen Transmission and Reduce Seed Dormancy
<p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous organelles in plant cells, but their physiological roles are largely unknown. To gain insight into the function of LDs in plants, we have characterized the Arabidopsis homologs of SEIPIN proteins, which are crucial factors for LD biogenesis in yeast and animals. <i>SEIPIN1</i> is expressed almost exclusively in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s, while <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> have broader expression profiles with maximal levels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s and pollen, where LDs accumulate most abundantly. Genetic analysis demonstrates that all three <i>SEIPINs</i> contribute to proper LD biogenesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s, whereas in pollen, only <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> play a significant role. The double <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants accumulate extremely enlarged LDs in seeds and pollen, which hinders their subsequent mobilization during germination. Interestingly, electron microscopy analysis reveals the presence of nuclear LDs attached to type I nucleoplasmic reticulum in triple <i>seipin</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s, supporting that SEIPINs are essential for maintaining the correct polarity of LD budding at the nuclear envelope, restricting it to the outer membrane. In pollen, the perturbations in LD biogenesis and turnover are coupled to reduced germination in vitro and with lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization efficiency in vivo. In seeds, germination per se is not affected in <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants, but there is a striking increase in seed dormancy levels. Our findings reveal the relevance of SEIPIN-dependent LD biogenesis in pollen transmission and in adjusting the timing of seed germination, two key adaptive traits of great importance in agriculture.</p>

Two SUMO Proteases SUMO PROTEASE RELATED TO FERTILITY1 and 2 Are Required for Fertility in Arabidopsis
<p>In plants, the posttranslational modification small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is involved in regulating several important developmental and cellular processes, including flowering time control and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we report two proteases, SUMO PROTEASE RELATED TO FERTILITY1 (SPF1) and SPF2, that regulate male and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gamete and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong> development and remove SUMO from proteins in vitro and in vivo. <i>spf1</i> mutants exhibit abnormal floral structures and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong> development, while <i>spf2</i> mutants exhibit largely a wild-type phenotype. However, <i>spf1 spf2</i> double mutants exhibit severe abnormalities in microgametogenesis, megagametogenesis, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong> development, suggesting that the two genes are functionally redundant. Mutation of <i>SPF1</i> and <i>SPF2</i> genes also results in mi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>pression of generative- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>-specific genes. In vitro, SPF1 and SPF2 process SUMO1 precursors into a mature form, and as expected in vivo, <i>spf1</i> and <i>spf2</i> mutants accumulate SUMO conjugates. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong> SAC DEVELOPMENT ARREST9 (EDA9) as an SPF1-interacting protein. In vivo, we demonstrate that EDA9 is sumolyated and that, in <i>spf1</i> mutants, EDA9-SUMO conjugates increase in abundance, demonstrating that EDA9 is a substrate of SPF1. Together, our results demonstrate that SPF1 and SPF2 are two SUMO proteases important for plant development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Transcription Factor MYB26 Is Key to Spatial Specificity in Anther Secondary Thickening Formation
<p>Successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization relies on the production and effective release of viable pollen. Failure of anther opening (dehiscence), results in male sterility, although the pollen may be fully functional. MYB26 regulates the formation of secondary thickening in the anther endothecium, which is critical for anther dehiscence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ity. Here, we show that although the <i>MYB26</i> transcript shows expression in multiple floral organs, the MYB26 protein is localized specifically to the anther endothecium nuclei and that it directly regulates two <i>NAC</i> domain genes, <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, which are critical for the induction of secondary thickening biosynthesis genes. However, there is a complex relationship of regulation between these genes and MYB26. Using DEX-inducible MYB26 lines and overexpression in the various mutant backgrounds, we have shown that MYB26 up-regulates both <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> expression. Surprisingly normal thickening and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ity rescue does not occur in the absence of MYB26, even with constitutively induced <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, suggesting an additional essential role for MYB26 in this regulation. Combined overexpression of <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> in <i>myb26</i> facilitates limited ectopic thickening in the anther epidermis, but not in the endothecium, and thus fails to rescue dehiscence. Therefore, by a series of regulatory controls through MYB26, NST1, NST2, secondary thickening is formed specifically within the endothecium; this specificity is essential for anther opening.</p>

RopGEF1 Plays a Critical Role in Polar Auxin Transport in Early Development
<p>Polar auxin transport, facilitated by the combined activities of auxin influx and efflux carriers to maintain asymmetric auxin distribution, is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>RopGEF1</i>, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs), is critically involved in polar distribution of auxin influx carrier AUX1 and differential accumulation of efflux carriers PIN7 and PIN2 and is important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong> and early seedling development when RopGEF1 is prevalently expressed. Knockdown or knockout of <i>RopGEF1</i> induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong> defects, cotyledon vein breaks, and delayed root gravity responses. Altered expression from the auxin response reporter <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in the root pole of <i>RopGEF1</i>-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s and loss of asymmetric distribution of <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in their gravistimulated root tips suggest that auxin distribution is affected in <i>ropgef1</i> mutants. This is reflected by the polarity of AUX1 being altered in <i>ropgef1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s and roots, shifting from the normal apical membrane location to a basal location in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong> central vascular and root protophloem cells and also reduced PIN7 accumulation at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s and altered PIN2 distribution in gravistimulated roots of mutant seedlings. In establishing that RopGEF1 is critical for AUX1 localization and PIN differential accumulation, our results reveal a role for RopGEF1 in cell polarity and polar auxin transport whereby it imapcts auxin-mediated plant growth and development.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, a shallower gradient was observed for males. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Development of the GABA-ergic signaling system and its role in larval swimming in sea urchin
<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the development and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic regulation of larval swimming in the sea urchin <i>Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus</i> by cloning glutamate decarboxylase (<i>Hp-gad</i>), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<i>Hp-gabrA</i>) and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein (<i>Hp-gabarap</i>), and by performing immunohistochemistry. The regulation of larval swimming was increasingly dependent on the GABAergic system, which was active from the 2 days post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization (d.p.f.) pluteus stage onwards. GABA-immunoreactive cells were detected as a subpopulation of secondary mesenchyme cells during gastrulation and eventually constituted the ciliary band and a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells during the pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gad</i> transcription was detected by RT-PCR during the period when Hp-Gad-positive cells were seen as a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells and on the apical side of the ciliary band from the 2 d.p.f. pluteus stage. Consistent with these observations, inhibition of GAD with 3-mercaptopropioninc acid inhibited GABA immunoreactivity and larval swimming dose dependently. <i>Hp-gabrA</i> amplimers were detected weakly in un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>s and 4 d.p.f. plutei but strongly from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>s to 2 d.p.f. plutei, and Hp-GabrA, together with GABA, was localized at the ciliary band in association with dopamine receptor D1 from the two-arm pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gabarap</i> transcription and protein expression were detected from the swimming blastula stage. Inhibition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor by bicuculline inhibited larval swimming dose dependently. Inhibition of larval swimming by either 3-mercaptopropionic acid or bicuculline was more severe in older larvae (17 and 34 d.p.f. plutei) than in younger ones (1 d.p.f. prism larvae).</p>

Phenotypic rescue of a <i>Drosophila</i> model of mitochondrial ANT1 disease
<p>A point mutation in the <i>Drosophila</i> gene that codes for the major adult isoform of adenine nuclear translocase (ANT) represents a model for human diseases that are associated with ANT insufficiency [<i>stress-sensitive B<sup>1</sup></i> (<i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i>)]. We characterized the organismal, bioenergetic and molecular phenotype of <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies then tested strategies to compensate the mutant phenotype. In addition to developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures, <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies have an impaired response to sound, defective male courtship, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e sterility and curtailed lifespan. These phenotypes, excluding the latter two, are shared with the mitoribosomal protein S12 mutant, <i>tko<sup>25t</sup></i>. Mitochondria from <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults showed a decreased respiratory control ratio and downregulation of cytochrome oxidase. <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults exhibited ATP depletion, lactate accumulation and changes in gene expression that were consistent with a metabolic shift towards glycolysis, characterized by activation of lactate dehydrogenase and anaplerotic pathways. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es also showed downregulation of many genes that are required for oogenesis, and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>s, although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ized, failed to develop to the larval stages. The <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> phenotypes of developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures were alleviated by an altered mitochondrial DNA background. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e sterility was substantially rescued by somatic expression of alternative oxidase (AOX) from the sea squirt <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>, whereas AOX did not alleviate developmental delay. Our findings illustrate the potential of different therapeutic strategies for ANT-linked diseases, based on alleviating metabolic stress.</p>

Dual-spindle formation in zygotes keeps parental genomes apart in early mammalian embryos
<p>At the beginning of mammalian life, the genetic material from each parent meets when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> divides. It was previously thought that a single microtubule spindle is responsible for spatially combining the two genomes and then segregating them to create the two-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>. We used light-sheet microscopy to show that two bipolar spindles form in the zygote and then independently congress the maternal and paternal genomes. These two spindles aligned their poles before anaphase but kept the parental genomes apart during the first cleavage. This spindle assembly mechanism provides a potential rationale for erroneous divisions into more than two blastomeric nuclei observed in mammalian zygotes and reveals the mechanism behind the observation that parental genomes occupy separate nuclear compartments in the two-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>.</p>

These include the <i>male secreted short </i>(<i>mss</i>) gene family, which encodes sperm surface glycoproteins conserved only in outcrossing species.

<i>Arabidopsis</i> pollen tube integrity and sperm release are regulated by RALF-mediated signaling
<p>In flowering plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization requires complex cell-to-cell communication events between the pollen tube and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive tissues, which are controlled by extracellular signaling molecules interacting with receptors at the pollen tube surface. We found that two such receptors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, BUPS1 and BUPS2, and their peptide ligands, RALF4 and RALF19, are pollen tube–expressed and are required to maintain pollen tube integrity. BUPS1 and BUPS2 interact with receptors ANXUR1 and ANXUR2 via their ectodomains, and both sets of receptors bind RALF4 and RALF19. These receptor-ligand interactions are in competition with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-derived ligand RALF34, which induces pollen tube bursting at nanomolar concentrations. We propose that RALF34 replaces RALF4 and RALF19 at the interface of pollen tube–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte contact, thereby deregulating BUPS-ANXUR signaling and in turn leading to pollen tube rupture and sperm release.</p>

Fertile offspring from sterile sex chromosome trisomic mice

We show that during reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), fibroblasts from sterile trisomic XXY and XYY mice lose the extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome through a phenomenon we term trisomy-biased chromosome loss (TCL). Resulting euploid XY iPSCs can be differentiated into the male germ cell lineage and functional sperm that can be used in intracytoplasmic sperm injection to produce chromosomally normal, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>e offspring. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome loss is comparatively infrequent during mouse XX and XY iPSC generation.

Ductal sex determination
<p>How the physical differences between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es develop is an intriguing process. In mammals, the first important stage in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination occurs during fetal life, when the male-determining Y chromosome expresses a gene called <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determining region Y</i> (<i>SRY</i>), which acts on the bipotential gonad to initiate testis (instead of ovary) formation (<i>1</i>). Landmark experiments by Jost in the 1950s showed that the development of male-specific structures is established by factors produced from the emerging testis, namely androgens and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) (<i>2</i>). This suggested that the formation of male characteristics is an active process, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-specific differentiation is passive. On page 717 of this issue, Zhao <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e development is also an active process.</p>

<p>Successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization in flowering plants depends on the precise directional growth control of pollen tube through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pistil tissue toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte contained in the ovule for delivery of nonmotile sperm cells. Cys-rich peptides LUREs secreted from the synergid cells on either side of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> cell act as ovular attractants of pollen tubes. Competency control by the pistil is crucial for the response of pollen tubes to these ovular attractants. We recently reported that ovular 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl arabinogalactan (AMOR) induces competency of the pollen tube to respond to ovular attractant LURE peptides in <i>Torenia fournieri.</i> The beta isomer of the terminal disaccharide 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl galactose was essential and sufficient for the competency induction. However, critical and noncritical structures in the disaccharide have not been dissected deeply. Herein, we report the synthesis of new AMOR analogs and the structure-activity relationships for AMOR activity in the presence of these synthesized analogs. Removal of 4-<i>O</i>-methyl group or –COOH from the glucuronosyl residue of the disaccharide dramatically reduces AMOR activity. The pyranose backbone of the second sugar of disaccharide is essential for the activity but not hydroxy groups. The role of beta isomer of the disaccharide 4-Me-GlcA-β(1,6)-Gal is very specific for competency control, as there was no difference in effect among the sugar analogs tested for pollen germination. This study represents the first structure-activity relationship study, to our knowledge, of a sugar molecule involved in plant reproduction, which opens a way for modification of the molecule without loss of activity.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Male–Female Sexual Dimorphism Predates the Gender-Based Divergence of the Mating Locus Gene <i>MAT3/RB</i>
<p>The molecular bases for the evolution of male–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphism are possible to study in volvocine algae because they encompass the entire range of reproductive morphologies from isogamy to oogamy. In 1978, Charlesworth suggested the model of a gamete size gene becoming linked to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-determining or mating type locus (<i>MT</i>) as a mechanism for the evolution of anisogamy. Here, we carried out the first comprehensive study of a candidate <i>MT-</i>linked oogamy gene, <i>MAT3/RB</i>, across the volvocine lineage. We found that evolution of anisogamy/oogamy predates the extremely high male–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e divergence of <i>MAT3</i> that characterizes the <i>Volvox carteri</i> lineage. These data demonstrate very little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-linked sequence divergence of <i>MAT3</i> between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es in other volvocine groups, though linkage between <i>MAT3</i> and the mating locus appears to be conserved. These data implicate genetic determinants other than or in addition to <i>MAT3</i> in the evolution of anisogamy in volvocine algae.</p>

High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice
<p>Increased oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of reproduction. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of oxidative damage during reproduction. We tested whether the link between reproduction and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and antioxidative capacity. We studied the effect of reproduction on OS in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es showed higher oxidative damage to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Reproduction did not affect oxidative damage to lipids in either line; however, it reduced damage to DNA in L-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Reproduction increased catalase activity in liver (significantly stronger in L-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of reproduction on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS.</p>

A viral aphrodisiac in the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i>
<p>We identified the insect iridovirus IIV-6/CrIV as a pathogen of the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i> using electron microscopy (EM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. EM showed that the virus attacks the fat body, an organ important for protein production, immune function and lipid storage. During infection the fat body hypertrophied, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> production withered, leaving the lateral oviducts empty of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>s; the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es were effectively sterile. EM of the testis of infected males suggests that the testis was not invaded by the virus, although sperm taken from the spermatophores of infected males showed little or no motility. Nevertheless, males and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es continued to mate when infected. In fact, infected males were quicker to court <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es than uninfected controls. The virus benefits from the continued <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual behaviour of its host; transmission studies show that the virus can be spread through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual contact. Sickness behaviour, the adaptive reduction of feeding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual behaviour that is induced by an activated immune system, was absent in infected crickets. Total haemolymph protein was reduced, as was phenoloxidase activity, suggesting a reduction in immune protein production by the fat body. The evidence suggests that during IIV-6/CrIV infection, the immune signal(s) that induces sickness behaviour is absent. Curtailment of a host's sickness behaviour may be necessary for any pathogen that is spread by host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual behaviour.</p>

Biomechanics of substrate boring by fig wasps
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e insects of diverse orders bore into substrates to deposit their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>s. Such insects must overcome several biomechanical challenges to successfully oviposit, which include the selection of suitable substrates through which the ovipositor can penetrate without itself fracturing. In many cases, the insect may also need to steer and manipulate the ovipositor within the substrate to deliver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong>s at desired locations before rapidly retracting her ovipositor to avoid predation. In the case of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e parasitoid ichneumonid wasps, this process is repeated multiple times during her lifetime, thus testing the ability of the ovipositioning apparatus to endure fracture and fatigue. What specific adaptations does the ovipositioning apparatus of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e ichneumonoid wasp possess to withstand these challenges? We addressed this question using a model system composed of parasitoid and pollinator fig wasps. First, we show that parasitoid ovipositor tips have teeth-like structures, preferentially enriched with zinc, unlike the smooth morphology of pollinator ovipositors. We describe sensillae present on the parasitoid ovipositor tip that are likely to aid in the detection of chemical species and mechanical deformations and sample microenvironments within the substrate. Second, using atomic force microscopy, we show that parasitoid tip regions have a higher modulus compared with regions proximal to the abdomen in parasitoid and pollinator ovipositors. Finally, we use videography to film wasps during substrate boring and analyse buckling of the ovipositor to estimate the forces required for substrate boring. Together, these results allow us to describe the biomechanical principles underlying substrate boring in parasitoid ichneumonid wasps. Such studies may be useful for the biomimetic design of surgical tools and in the use of novel mechanisms to bore through hard substrates.</p>

<i>De novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing mouse embryos originating from enucleolated zygotes
<p>The large, compact oocyte nucleoli, sometimes referred to as nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs), are essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>nic development in mammals; in their absence, the oocytes complete maturation and can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ized, but no nucleoli are formed in the zygote or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>, leading to developmental failure. It has been convincingly documented that zygotes inherit the oocyte nucleolar material and form NPBs again in pronuclei. It is commonly accepted that during early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>nic development, the original compact zygote NPBs gradually transform into reticulated nucleoli of somatic cells. Here, we show that zygote NPBs are not required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>nic and full-term development in the mouse. When NPBs were removed from late-stage zygotes by micromanipulation, the enucleolated zygotes developed to the blastocyst stage and, after transfer to recipients, live pups were obtained. We also describe <i>de novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s. After removal of NPBs from zygotes, they formed new nucleoli after several divisions. These results indicate that the zygote NPBs are not used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>nic development and that the nucleoli in developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s originate from <i>de novo</i> synthesized materials.</p>

A microdevice to locally electroporate embryos with high efficiency and reduced cell damage
<p>The ability to follow and modify cell behaviour with accurate spatiotemporal resolution is a prerequisite to study morphogenesis in developing organisms. Electroporation, the delivery of exogenous molecules into targeted cell populations through electric permeation of the plasma membrane, has been used with this aim in different model systems. However, current localised electroporation strategies suffer from insufficient reproducibility and mediocre survival when applied to small and delicate organisms such as early post-implantation mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s. We introduce here a microdevice to achieve localised electroporation with high efficiency and reduced cell damage. <i>In silico</i> simulations using a simple electrical model of mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s indicated that a dielectric guide-based design would improve on existing alternatives. Such a device was microfabricated and its capacities tested by targeting the distal visceral endoderm (DVE), a migrating cell population essential for anterior-posterior axis establishment. Transfection was efficiently and reproducibly restricted to fewer than four visceral endoderm cells without compromising cell behaviour and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong> survival. Combining targeted mosaic expression of fluorescent markers with live imaging in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s revealed that, like leading DVE cells, non-leading ones send long basal projections and intercalate during their migration. Finally, we show that the use of our microsystem can be extended to a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>logical contexts, from preimplantation stages to organ explants. Hence, we have experimentally validated an approach delivering a tailor-made tool for the study of morphogenesis in the mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>. Furthermore, we have delineated a comprehensive strategy for the development of ad hoc electroporation devices.</p>

The tissue-specific transcriptomic landscape of the mid-gestational mouse embryo
<p>Differential gene expression is a prerequisite for the formation of multiple cell types from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egg</span></strong> during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>genesis. Understanding the gene regulatory networks controlling cellular differentiation requires the identification of crucial differentially expressed control genes and, ideally, the determination of the complete transcriptomes of each individual cell type. Here, we have analyzed the transcriptomes of six major tissues dissected from mid-gestational (TS12) mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>s. Approximately one billion reads derived by RNA-seq analysis provided extended transcript lengths, novel first exons and alternative transcripts of known genes. We have identified 1375 genes showing tissue-specific expression, providing gene signatures for each of the six tissues. In addition, we have identified 1403 novel putative long noncoding RNA gene loci, 439 of which show differential expression. Our analysis provides the first complete transcriptome data for the mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embryo</span></strong>. It offers a rich data source for the analysis of individual genes and gene regulatory networks controlling mid-gestational development.</p>

Lipocalin 2 binds to membrane phosphatidylethanolamine to induce lipid raft movement in a PKA-dependent manner and modulates sperm maturation
<p>Mammalian sperm undergo multiple maturation steps after leaving the testis in order to become competent for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ization, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. In terms of identifying factors crucial for these processes <i>in vivo</i>, we found that lipocalin 2 (<i>Lcn2</i>), which is known as an innate immune factor inhibiting bacterial and malarial growth, can modulate sperm maturation. Most sperm that migrated to the oviduct of wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es underwent lipid raft reorganization and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein shedding, which are signatures of sperm maturation, but few did so in <i>Lcn2</i> null mice. Furthermore, we found that LCN2 binds to membrane phosphatidylethanolamine to reinforce lipid raft reorganization via a PKA-dependent mechanism and promotes sperm to acquire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong></span></strong>ity by facilitating cholesterol efflux. These observations imply that mammals possess a mode for sperm maturation in addition to the albumin-mediated pathway.</p>

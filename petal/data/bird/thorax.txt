RUNX2 correlates with subtype-specific breast cancer in a human tissue microarray, and ectopic expression of <i>Runx2</i> perturbs differentiation in the mouse mammary gland
<p>RUNX2, a master regulator of osteogenesis, is oncogenic in the lymphoid lineage; however, little is known about its role in epithelial cancers. Upregulation of <i>RUNX2</i> in cell lines correlates with increased invasiveness and the capacity to form osteolytic disease in models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> and prostate cancer. However, most studies have analysed the effects of this gene in a limited number of cell lines and its role in primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer has not been resolved. Using a human tumour tissue microarray, we show that high RUNX2 expression is significantly associated with oestrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/HER2-negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancers and that patients with high RUNX2 expression have a poorer survival rate than those with negative or low expression. We confirm <i>RUNX2</i> as a gene that has a potentially important functional role in triple-negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer. To investigate the role of this gene in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer, we made a transgenic model in which <i>Runx2</i> is specifically expressed in murine mammary epithelium under the control of the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) promoter. We show that ectopic <i>Runx2</i> perturbs normal development in pubertal and lactating animals, delaying ductal elongation and inhibiting lobular alveolar differentiation. We also show that the <i>Runx2</i> transgene elicits age-related, pre-neoplastic changes in the mammary epithelium of older transgenic animals, suggesting that elevated RUNX2 expression renders such tissue more susceptible to oncogenic changes and providing further evidence that this gene might have an important, context-dependent role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer.</p>

Sex Differences in the Presentation and Perception of Symptoms Among Young Patients With Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Some studies report that women are less likely to present with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> pain for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Information on symptom presentation, perception of symptoms, and care-seeking behaviors is limited for young patients with AMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We interviewed 2009 women and 976 men aged 18 to 55 years hospitalized for AMI at 103 US hospitals participating in the VIRGO study (Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients). Structured patient interviews during the index AMI hospitalization were used to collect information on symptom presentation, perception of symptoms, and care-seeking behaviors. We compared patient characteristics and presentation information by sex. Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between sex and symptom presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of women (87.0%) and men (89.5%) presented with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> pain (defined as pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort). Women were more likely to present with ≥3 associated symptoms than men (eg, epigastric symptoms, palpitations, and pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, arms, or between the shoulder blades; 61.9% for women versus 54.8% for men, <i>P</i><0.001). In adjusted analyses, women with an ST-segment–elevation AMI were more likely than men to present without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> pain (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.22). In comparison with men, women were more likely to perceive symptoms as stress/anxiety (20.9% versus 11.8%, <i>P</i><0.001) but less likely to attribute symptoms to muscle pain (15.4% versus 21.2%, <i>P</i>=0.029). Approximately 29.5% of women and 22.1% of men sought medical care for similar symptoms before their hospitalization (<i>P</i><0.001); however, 53% of women reported that their provider did not think these symptoms were heart-related in comparison with 37% of men (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The presentation of AMI symptoms was similar for young women and men, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> pain as the predominant symptom for both sexes.

Duration of Ventilations During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation by Lay Rescuers and First Responders
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The 2010 guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation allow 5 seconds to give 2 breaths to deliver sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> compressions and to keep perfusion pressure high. This study aims to determine whether the recommended short interruption for ventilations by trained lay rescuers and first responders can be achieved and to evaluate its consequence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> compressions and survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From a prospective data collection of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we used automatic external defibrillator recordings of cardiopulmonary resuscitation by rescuers who had received a standard European Resuscitation Council basic life support and automatic external defibrillator course. Ventilation periods and total compressions delivered per minute during each 2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation cycle were measured, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> compression fraction was calculated. Neurological intact survival to discharge was studied in relation to these factors and covariates. We included 199 automatic external defibrillator recordings. The median interruption time for 2 ventilations was 7 seconds (25th–75th percentile, 6–9 seconds). Of all rescuers, 21% took <5 seconds and 83% took <10 seconds for a ventilation period; 97%, 88%, and 63% of rescuers were able to deliver >60, >70, and >80 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> compressions per minute, respectively. The median <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> compression fraction was 65% (25th–75th percentile, 59%–71%). Survival was 25% (49 of 199), not associated with long or short ventilation pauses when controlled for covariates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The great majority of rescuers can give 2 rescue breaths in <10 seconds and deliver at least 70 compressions in a minute. Longer pauses for ventilations are not associated with worse outcome. Guidelines may allow longer pauses for ventilations with no detriment to survival.</p></sec>

A TGFβ–miR-182–BRCA1 axis controls the mammary differentiation hierarchy
<p>Maintenance of mammary functional capacity during cycles of proliferation and regression depends on appropriate cell fate decisions of mammary progenitor cells to populate an epithelium consisting of secretory luminal cells and contractile myoepithelial cells. It is well established that transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) restricts mammary epithelial cell proliferation and that sensitivity to TGFβ is decreased in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer. We show that TGFβ also exerts control of mammary progenitor self-renewal and lineage commitment decisions by stringent regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer associated 1 (BRCA1), which controls stem cell self-renewal and lineage commitment. Either genetic depletion of <i>Tgfb1</i> or transient blockade of TGFβ increased self-renewal of mammary progenitor cells in mice, cultured primary mammary epithelial cells, and also skewed lineage commitment toward the myoepithelial fate. TGFβ stabilized the abundance of BRCA1 by reducing the abundance of microRNA-182 (miR-182). Ectopic expression of BRCA1 or antagonism of miR-182 in cultured TGFβ-deficient mammary epithelial cells restored luminal lineage commitment. These findings reveal that TGFβ modulation of BRCA1 directs mammary epithelial cell fate and, because stem or progenitor cells are thought to be the cell of origin for aggressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer subtypes, suggest that TGFβ dysregulation during tumorigenesis may promote distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer subtypes.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 promotes glutamine metabolism in tumors by activating the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ
<p>Malignant tumors reprogram cellular metabolism to support cancer cell proliferation and survival. Although most cancers depend on a high rate of aerobic glycolysis, many cancer cells also display addiction to glutamine. Glutamine transporters and glutaminase activity are critical for glutamine metabolism in tumor cells. We found that the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 activated the TEAD family transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), likely in a ligand-independent manner, to promote glutamine metabolism in cells and mouse models of HER2-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer. Overexpression of EphA2 induced the nuclear accumulation of YAP and TAZ and increased the expression of YAP/TAZ target genes. Inhibition of the GTPase Rho or the kinase ROCK abolished EphA2-dependent YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. Silencing <i>YAP</i> or <i>TAZ</i> substantially reduced the amount of intracellular glutamate through decreased expression of <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i>, respectively, genes that encode proteins that promote glutamine uptake and metabolism. The regulatory DNA elements of both <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i> contain TEAD binding sites and were bound by TEAD4 in an EphA2-dependent manner. In patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer tissues, <i>EphA2</i> expression positively correlated with that of <i>YAP</i> and <i>TAZ</i>, as well as that of <i>GLS</i> and <i>SLC1A5</i>. Although high expression of <i>EphA2</i> predicted enhanced metastatic potential and poor patient survival, it also rendered HER2-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer cells more sensitive to glutaminase inhibition. The findings define a previously unknown mechanism of EphA2-mediated glutaminolysis through YAP/TAZ activation in HER2-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer and identify potential therapeutic targets in patients.</p>

Breast tumors educate the proteome of stromal tissue in an individualized but coordinated manner
<p>Cancer forms specialized microenvironmental niches that promote local invasion and colonization. Engrafted patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) locally invade and colonize naive stroma in mice while enabling unambiguous molecular discrimination of human proteins in the tumor from mouse proteins in the microenvironment. To characterize how patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> tumors form a niche and educate naive stroma, subcutaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer PDXs were globally profiled by species-specific quantitative proteomics. Regulation of PDX stromal proteins by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> tumors was extensive, with 35% of the stromal proteome altered by tumors consistently across different animals and passages. Differentially regulated proteins in the stroma clustered into six signatures, which included both known and previously unappreciated contributors to tumor invasion and colonization. Stromal proteomes were coordinately regulated; however, the sets of proteins altered by each tumor were highly distinct. Integrated analysis of tumor and stromal proteins, a comparison made possible in these xenograft models, indicated that the known hallmarks of cancer contribute pleiotropically to establishing and maintaining the microenvironmental niche of the tumor. Education of the stroma by the tumor is therefore an intrinsic property of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> tumors that is highly individualized, yet proceeds by consistent, nonrandom, and defined tumor-promoting molecular alterations.</p>

Prediction of the pre-morbid 3D anatomy of the proximal humerus based on statistical shape modelling
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Restoring the pre-morbid anatomy of the proximal humerus is a   goal of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anatomi</span></strong>cal shoulder arthroplasty, but reliance is placed   on the surgeon’s experience and on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anatomi</span></strong>cal estimations. The purpose   of this study was to present a novel method, ‘Statistical Shape   Modelling’, which accurately predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy   and calculates the 3D geometric parameters needed to restore normal   anatomy in patients with severe degenerative osteoarthritis or a   fracture of the proximal humerus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>From a database of 57 humeral CT scans 3D humeral reconstructions   were manually created. The reconstructions were used to construct   a statistical shape model (SSM), which was then tested on a second   set of 52 scans. For each humerus in the second set, 3D reconstructions   of four diaphyseal segments of varying lengths were created. These   reconstructions were chosen to mimic severe osteoarthritis, a fracture   of the surgical neck of the humerus and a proximal humeral fracture   with diaphyseal extension. The SSM was then applied to the diaphyseal   segments to see how well it predicted proximal morphology, using   the actual proximal humeral morphology for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the errors   of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature   and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were   2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm),   0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the   metaphysis excluded, mimicking a fracture of the surgical neck,   the errors of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius   of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the   humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3   mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm    (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports a novel, computerised method that accurately   predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy even in challenging   situations.

Prognostic Value of Noninvasive Cardiovascular Testing in Patients With Stable Chest Pain
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Optimal management of patients with stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> pain relies on the prognostic information provided by noninvasive cardiovascular testing, but there are limited data from randomized trials comparing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anatomi</span></strong>c with functional testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> Pain), patients with stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> pain and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomly assigned to functional testing (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA).

The primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalizations over a median follow-up of 26.1 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both the prevalence of normal test results and incidence rate of events in these patients were significantly lower among 4500 patients randomly assigned to CTA in comparison with 4602 patients randomly assigned to functional testing (33.4% versus 78.0%, and 0.9% versus 2.1%, respectively; both <i>P</i><0.001). In CTA, 54.0% of events (n=74/137) occurred in patients with nonobstructive CAD (1%–69% stenosis).

When test findings were stratified as mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal, hazard ratios for events in comparison with normal tests increased proportionally for CTA (2.94, 7.67, 10.13; all <i>P</i><0.001) but not for corresponding functional testing categories (0.94 [<i>P</i>=0.87], 2.65 [<i>P</i>=0.001], 3.88 [<i>P</i><0.001]).

Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Older Women After Contemporary Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes are resistant to radiation. However, cardiac radiation exposure causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation, a perturbation implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) and particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Radiotherapy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer results in variable cardiac radiation exposure and may increase the risk of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a population-based case-control study of incident HF in 170 female residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (59 cases and 111 controls), who underwent contemporary (1998–2013) radiotherapy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer with computed tomography–assisted radiotherapy planning. Controls were matched to cases for age, tumor side, chemotherapy use, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Mean cardiac radiation dose (MCRD) in each patient was calculated from the patient’s computed tomography images and radiotherapy plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean age at radiotherapy was 69±9 years. Of HF cases, 38 (64%) had EF≥50% (HFpEF), 18 (31%) had EF<50% (HF with reduced EF), and 3 (5%) did not have EF measured. The EF was ≥40% in 50 of the 56 HF cases (89%) with an EF measurement. The mean interval from radiotherapy to HF was 5.8±3.4 years. The odds of HF was higher in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or atrial fibrillation. The MCRD was 2.5 Gy (range, 0.2–13.1 Gy) and higher in cases (3.3±2.7 Gy) than controls (2.1±2.0 Gy; <i>P</i>=0.004). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HF per log MCRD was 9.1 (3.4–24.4) for any HF, 16.9 (3.9–73.7) for HFpEF, and 3.17 (0.8–13.0) for HF with reduced EF. The increased odds of any HF or HFpEF with increasing MCRD remained significant after adjustment for HF risk factors and in sensitivity analyses matching by cancer stage rather than tumor side. Only 18.6% of patients experienced new or recurrent ischemic events between radiotherapy and the onset of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The relative risk of HFpEF increases with increasing cardiac radiation exposure during contemporary conformal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer radiotherapy.

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

First insights into the functional role of vasicentric tracheids and parenchyma in eucalyptus species with solitary vessels: do they contribute to xylem efficiency or safety?
<p>The relationship between hydraulic specific conductivity (<i>k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>) and vulnerability to cavitation (VC) with size and number of vessels has been studied in many angiosperms. However, few of the studies link other cell types (vasicentric tracheids (VT), fibre–tracheids, parenchyma) with these hydraulic functions. <i>Eucalyptus</i> is one of the most important genera in forestry worldwide. It exhibits a complex wood anatomy, with solitary vessels surrounded by VT and parenchyma, which could serve as a good model to investigate the functional role of the different cell types in xylem functioning. Wood anatomy (several traits of vessels, VT, fibres and parenchyma) in conjunction with maximum <i>k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> and VC was studied in adult trees of commercial species with medium-to-high wood density (<i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> Labill., <i>Eucalyptus viminalis</i> Labill. and <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh.). Traits of cells accompanying vessels presented correlations with functional variables suggesting that they contribute to both increasing connectivity between adjacent vessels—and, therefore, to xylem conduction efficiency—and decreasing the probability of embolism propagation into the tissue, i.e., xylem safety. All three species presented moderate-to-high resistance to cavitation (mean <i>P</i><sub>50</sub> values = −2.4 to −4.2 MPa) with no general trade-off between efficiency and safety at the interspecific level. The results in these species do not support some well-established hypotheses of the functional meaning of wood anatomy.</p>

VEGF–neuropilin-2 signaling promotes stem-like traits in breast cancer cells by TAZ-mediated repression of the Rac GAP β2-chimaerin
<p>The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in cancer is not only well known in the context of angiogenesis but also important in the functional regulation of tumor cells. Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating tumor growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating cancer patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the activation of TAZ in various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling activated the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ activity. In a complex with the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the gene encoding the Rac GTPase-activating protein (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. By activating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac signaling; hence, the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 activity in CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 activity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere formation. Analysis of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer patient database revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in tumors. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in a feed-forward loop of TAZ activation and the acquisition of CSC properties.</p>

Skp2-dependent reactivation of AKT drives resistance to PI3K inhibitors
<p>The PI3K-AKT kinase signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers, particularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer, where amplification and somatic mutations of <i>PIK3CA</i> occur with high frequency in patients. Numerous small-molecule inhibitors targeting both PI3K and AKT are under clinical evaluation, but dose-limiting toxicities and the emergence of resistance limit therapeutic efficacy. Various resistance mechanisms to PI3K inhibitors have been identified, including de novo mutations, feedback activation of AKT, or cross-talk pathways. We found a previously unknown resistance mechanism to PI3K pathway inhibition that results in AKT rebound activation. In a subset of triple-negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer cell lines, treatment with a PI3K inhibitor or depletion of <i>PIK3CA</i> expression ultimately promoted AKT reactivation in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2, the kinases IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and the cell growth and metabolism-regulating complex mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2), but was independent of PI3K activity or PIP<sub>3</sub> production. Resistance to PI3K inhibitors correlated with the increased abundance of Skp2, ubiquitylation of AKT, cell proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. These findings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K inhibitor resistance may emerge in aggressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer cells.</p>

Oncogenic PI3K promotes methionine dependency in breast cancer cells through the cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT
<p>The precursor homocysteine is metabolized either through the methionine cycle to produce methionine or through the transsulfuration pathway to synthesize cysteine. Alternatively, cysteine can be obtained through uptake of its oxidized form, cystine. Many cancer cells exhibit methionine dependency such that their proliferation is impaired in growth media in which methionine is replaced by homocysteine. We showed that oncogenic <i>PIK3CA</i> and decreased expression of <i>SLC7A11</i>, a gene that encodes a cystine transporter also known as xCT, correlated with increased methionine dependency in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer cells. Oncogenic <i>PIK3CA</i> was sufficient to confer methionine dependency to mammary epithelial cells, partly by decreasing cystine uptake through the transcriptional and posttranslational inhibition of xCT. Manipulation of xCT activity altered the proliferation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer cells in methionine-deficient, homocysteine-containing media, suggesting that it functionally contributed to methionine dependency. We propose that concurrent with decreased cystine uptake through xCT, <i>PIK3CA</i> mutant cells use homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway to synthesize cysteine. Consequently, less homocysteine is available to produce methionine, contributing to methionine dependency. These results indicate that oncogenic <i>PIK3CA</i> alters methionine and cysteine utilization, partly by inhibiting xCT to contribute to the methionine dependency phenotype in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer cells.</p>

PI3K pathway regulates ER-dependent transcription in breast cancer through the epigenetic regulator KMT2D
<p>Activating mutations in <i>PIK3CA</i>, the gene encoding phosphoinositide-(3)-kinase α (PI3Kα), are frequently found in estrogen receptor (ER)–positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer. PI3Kα inhibitors, now in late-stage clinical development, elicit a robust compensatory increase in ER-dependent transcription that limits therapeutic efficacy. We investigated the chromatin-based mechanisms leading to the activation of ER upon PI3Kα inhibition. We found that PI3Kα inhibition mediates an open chromatin state at the ER target loci in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer models and clinical samples. KMT2D, a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, is required for FOXA1, PBX1, and ER recruitment and activation. AKT binds and phosphorylates KMT2D, attenuating methyltransferase activity and ER function, whereas PI3Kα inhibition enhances KMT2D activity. These findings uncover a mechanism that controls the activation of ER by the posttranslational modification of epigenetic regulators, providing a rationale for epigenetic therapy in ER-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer.</p>

Clinical Usefulness, Angiographic Characteristics, and Safety Evaluation of Intracoronary Acetylcholine Provocation Testing Among 921 Consecutive White Patients With Unobstructed Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Coronary spasm can cause myocardial ischemia and angina in patients with and those without obstructive coronary artery disease. However, provocation tests using intracoronary acetylcholine administration are rarely performed in clinical routine in the United States and Europe. Thus, we assessed the clinical usefulness, angiographic characteristics, and safety of intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing in white patients with unobstructed coronary arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From September 2007 to June 2010, a total of 921 consecutive patients (362 men, mean age 62±12years) who underwent diagnostic angiography for suspected myocardial ischemia and were found to have unobstructed coronary arteries (no stenosis ≥50%) were enrolled. The intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing was performed directly after angiography according to a standardized protocol. Three hundred forty-six patients (35%) reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> pain at rest, 222 (22%) reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> pain on exertion, 238 (24%) reported a combination of effort and resting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chest</span></strong> pain, and 41 (4%) presented with troponin-positive acute coronary syndrome. The overall frequency of epicardial spasm (>75% diameter reduction with angina and ischemic ECG shifts) was 33.4%, and the overall frequency of microvascular spasm (angina and ischemic ECG shifts without epicardial spasm) was 24.2%. Epicardial spasm was most often diffuse and located in the distal coronary segments (<i>P</i><0.01). No fatal or irreversible nonfatal complications occurred. However, 9 patients (1%) had minor complications (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia [n=1], fast paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [n=1], symptomatic bradycardia [n=6], and catheter-induced spasm [n=1]).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Epicardial and microvascular spasm are frequently found in white patients with unobstructed coronary arteries.

Winter drought impairs xylem phenology, anatomy and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine forests
<p>Continental Mediterranean forests face drought but also cold spells and both climate extremes can impair the resilience capacity of these forests. Climate warming could amplify the negative effects of cold spells by inducing premature dehardening. Here we capitalize on a winter drought-induced dieback triggered by a cold spell which occurred in December 2001 affecting Scots pine forests in eastern Spain. We assessed post-dieback recovery by quantifying and comparing radial growth and xylem anatomy of non-declining (ND, crown cover >50%) and declining (D, crown cover ≤50%) trees in two sites (VP, Villarroya de los Pinares; TO, Torrijas). We also characterized xylogenesis in both sites and aboveground productivity in site VP. Dieback caused legacy effects since needle loss, a 60% reduction in litter fall and radial-growth decline characterized D-trees 3 years after dieback symptoms started appearing in spring 2002. D-trees formed collapsed tracheids in the 2002-ring, particularly in the most affected VP site where xylogenesis differences between ND and D trees were most noticeable. The lower growth rates of D-trees were caused by a shorter duration of their major xylogenesis phases. In site VP the radial-enlargement and wall-thickening of tracheids were significantly reduced in D-trees as compared to ND-trees because these xylogenesis phases tended to start earlier and end later in ND-trees. Gompertz models fitted to tracheid production predicted that maximum growth rates occurred 11–12 days earlier in ND than in D-trees. The formation of radially-enlarging tracheids was enhanced by longer days in both study sites and also by wetter conditions in the driest TO site, but xylogenesis sensitivity to climate was reduced in D-trees. Winter-drought dieback impairs xylem anatomy and phenology, aboveground productivity, xylogenesis and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine populations. Affected stands show a costly post-dieback recovery challenging their resilience ability.</p>

Blockade of TNFR2 signaling enhances the immunotherapeutic effect of CpG ODN in a mouse model of colon cancer
<p>Through the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type II (TNFR2), TNF preferentially activates, expands, and promotes the phenotypic stability of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells. Those T<sub>reg</sub> cells that have a high abundance of TNFR2 have the maximal immunosuppressive capacity. We investigated whether targeting TNFR2 could effectively suppress the activity of T<sub>reg</sub> cells and consequently enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. We found that, relative to a suboptimal dose of the immunostimulatory Toll-like receptor 9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), the combination of the suboptimal dose of CpG ODN with the TNFR2-blocking antibody M861 more markedly inhibited the growth of subcutaneously grafted mouse CT26 colon tumor cells. This resulted in markedly fewer TNFR2<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells and more interferon-γ–positive (IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrating the tumor and improved long-term tumor-free survival in the mouse cohort. Tumor-free mice were resistant to rechallenge by the same but not unrelated (4T1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer) cells. Treatment with the combination of TNFR2-blocking antibody and a CD25-targeted antibody also resulted in enhanced inhibition of tumor growth in a syngeneic 4T1 mouse model of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer. Thus, the combination of a TNFR2 inhibitor and an immunotherapeutic stimulant may represent a more effective treatment strategy for various cancers.</p>

The lncRNA H19 mediates breast cancer cell plasticity during EMT and MET plasticity by differentially sponging miR-200b/c and let-7b
<p>Metastasis is a multistep process by which tumor cells disseminate from their primary site and form secondary tumors at a distant site. The pathophysiological course of metastasis is mediated by the dynamic plasticity of cancer cells, which enables them to shift between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes through a transcriptionally regulated program termed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Using a mouse model of spontaneous metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer, we investigated the molecular mediators of metastatic competence within a heterogeneous primary tumor and how these cells then manipulated their epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity during the metastatic process. We isolated cells from the primary mammary tumor, the circulation, and metastatic lesions in the lung in TA2 mice and found that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 mediated EMT and MET by differentially acting as a sponge for the microRNAs miR-200b/c and let-7b. We found that this ability enabled H19 to modulate the expression of the microRNA targets <i>Git2</i> and <i>Cyth3</i>, respectively, which encode regulators of the RAS superfamily member adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor (ARF), a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that promotes cell migration associated with EMT and disseminating tumor cells. Decreasing the abundance of H19 or manipulating that of members in its axis prevented metastasis from grafts in syngeneic mice. Abundance of H19, GIT2, and CYTH3 in patient samples further suggests that H19 might be exploited as a biomarker for metastatic cells within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> tumors and perhaps as a therapeutic target to prevent metastasis.</p>

The transcription factor MAFK induces EMT and malignant progression of triple-negative breast cancer cells through its target GPNMB
<p>Triple-negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer (TNBC) is particularly aggressive and difficult to treat. For example, the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) pathway is implicated in TNBC progression and metastasis, but its opposing role in tumor suppression in healthy tissues and early-stage lesions makes it a challenging target. Therefore, additional molecular characterization of TNBC may lead to improved patient prognosis by informing the development and optimum use of targeted therapies. We found that musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF) oncogene family protein K (MAFK), a member of the small MAF family of transcription factors that are induced by the TGF-β pathway, was abundant in human TNBC and aggressive mouse mammary tumor cell lines. MAFK promoted tumorigenic growth and metastasis by 4T1 cells when implanted subcutaneously in mice. Overexpression of MAFK in mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> epithelial NMuMG cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes and promoted tumor formation and invasion in mice. MAFK induced the expression of the gene encoding the transmembrane glycoprotein nmb (GPNMB). Similar to MAFK, GPNMB overexpression in NMuMG cells induced EMT, tumor formation, and invasion, in mice, whereas knockdown of MAFK in tumor cells before implantation suppressed tumor growth and progression. <i>MAFK</i> and <i>GPNMB</i> expression correlated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients. These findings suggest that MAFK and its target gene <i>GPNMB</i> play important roles in the malignant progression of TNBC cells, offering potentially new therapeutic targets for TNBC patients.</p>

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression
<p>Ion channels regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in normal and neoplastic cells through cell-cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) transmembrane receptors called integrins. K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human ether-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) channel shapes action potential firing in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in tumors, where it modulates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1 interacted with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human cancer cells. This interaction was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 interaction. Although open hERG1 channels did not interact as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed channels, current flow through hERG1 channels was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and cancer cells. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer cells expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas metastasis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer cells was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin interaction was disrupted. We conclude that the interaction of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 channels in cancer cells stimulated distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of tumor progression.</p>

Metabolic recycling of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase supports breast cancer biomass
<p>Ammonia is a ubiquitous by-product of cellular metabolism; however, the biological consequences of ammonia production are not fully understood, especially in cancer. We found that ammonia is not merely a toxic waste product but is recycled into central amino acid metabolism to maximize nitrogen utilization. In our experiments, human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer cells primarily assimilated ammonia through reductive amination catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH); secondary reactions enabled other amino acids, such as proline and aspartate, to directly acquire this nitrogen. Metabolic recycling of ammonia accelerated proliferation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breast</span></strong> cancer. In mice, ammonia accumulated in the tumor microenvironment and was used directly to generate amino acids through GDH activity. These data show that ammonia is not only a secreted waste product but also a fundamental nitrogen source that can support tumor biomass.</p>

RAPTOR Controls Developmental Growth Transitions by Altering the Hormonal and Metabolic Balance
<p>Vegetative growth requires the systemic coordination of numerous cellular processes, which are controlled by regulatory proteins that monitor extracellular and intracellular cues and translate them into growth decisions. In eukaryotes, one of the central factors regulating growth is the serine/threonine protein kinase Target of Rapamycin (TOR), which forms complexes with regulatory proteins. To understand the function of one such regulatory protein, Regulatory-Associated Protein of TOR 1B (RAPTOR1B), in plants, we analyzed the effect of <i>raptor1b</i> mutations on growth and physiology in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) by detailed phenotyping, metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic analyses. Mutation of <i>RAPTOR1B</i> resulted in a strong reduction of TOR kinase activity, leading to massive changes in central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, accumulation of excess starch, and induction of autophagy. These shifts led to a significant reduction of plant growth that occurred nonlinearly during developmental stage transitions. This phenotype was accompanied by changes in cell morphology and tissue anatomy. In contrast to previous studies in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), we found that the Arabidopsis <i>raptor1b</i> mutation did not affect chloroplast development or photosynthetic electron transport efficiency; however, it resulted in decreased CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate and increased stomatal conductance. The <i>raptor1b</i> mutants also had reduced abscisic acid levels. Surprisingly, abscisic acid feeding experiments resulted in partial complementation of the growth phenotypes, indicating the tight interaction between TOR function and hormone synthesis and signaling in plants.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under control and water-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with control conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

Immunity at Cauliflower Hydathodes Controls Systemic Infection by <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> pv <i>campestris</i>
<p>Hydathodes are water pores found on leaves of a wide range of vascular plants and are the sites of guttation. We report here on the detailed anatomy of cauliflower (<i>Brassica</i> <i>oleracea</i>) and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) hydathodes. Hydathode surface presents pores resembling stomata giving access to large cavities. Beneath, the epithem is composed of a lacunar and highly vascularized parenchyma offering a direct connection between leaf surface and xylem vessels. Arabidopsis hydathode pores were responsive to ABA and light similar to stomata. The flg22 flagellin peptide, a well-characterized elicitor of plant basal immunity, did not induce closure of hydathode pores in contrast to stomata. Because hydathodes are natural infection routes for several pathogens, we investigated hydathode infection by the adapted vascular phytopathogenic bacterium <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> pv <i>campestris</i> (<i>Xcc</i>), the causal agent of black rot disease of Brassicaceae. Microscopic observations of hydathodes six days postinoculation indicated a digestion of the epithem cells and a high bacterial multiplication. Postinvasive immunity was shown to limit pathogen growth in the epithem and is actively suppressed by the type III secretion system and its effector proteins. Altogether, these results give a detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anatomi</span></strong>c description of Brassicaceae hydathodes and highlight the efficient use of this tissue as an initial niche for subsequent vascular systemic dissemination of <i>Xcc</i> in distant plant tissues.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Developmental Control and Plasticity of Fruit and Seed Dimorphism in <i>Aethionema arabicum</i>
<p>Understanding how plants cope with changing habitats is a timely and important topic in plant research. Phenotypic plasticity describes the capability of a genotype to produce different phenotypes when exposed to different environmental conditions. In contrast, the constant production of a set of distinct phenotypes by one genotype mediates bet hedging, a strategy that reduces the temporal variance in fitness at the expense of a lowered arithmetic mean fitness. Both phenomena are thought to represent important adaptation strategies to unstable environments. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena, partly due to the lack of suitable model systems. We used phylogenetic and comparative analyses of fruit and seed anatomy, biomechanics, physiology, and environmental responses to study fruit and seed heteromorphism, a typical morphological basis of a bet-hedging strategy of plants, in the annual Brassicaceae species <i>Aethionema arabicum</i>. Our results indicate that heteromorphism evolved twice within the Aethionemeae, including once for the monophyletic annual <i>Aethionema</i> clade. The dimorphism of <i>Ae. arabicum</i> is associated with several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anatomi</span></strong>c, biomechanical, gene expression, and physiological differences between the fruit and seed morphs. However, fruit ratios and numbers change in response to different environmental conditions. Therefore, the life-history strategy of <i>Ae. arabicum</i> appears to be a blend of bet hedging and plasticity. Together with the available genomic resources, our results pave the way to use this species in future studies intended to unravel the molecular control of heteromorphism and plasticity.</p>

Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural selection is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their environments. Here, we present the first global study of natural selection in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species map of signatures of natural selection covering all major types of natural selection. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and positive selection varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most signatures of balancing and positive selection are species-specific, with signatures of balancing selection more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of positive selection across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of positive selection in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural selection in humans within its larger evolutionary context.

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Due to the complex anatomy of the pelvis, limb-sparing resections   of pelvic tumours achieving adequate surgical margins, can often   be difficult. The advent of computer navigation has improved the   precision of resection of these lesions, though there is little   evidence comparing resection with or without the assistance of navigation.</p><p>Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of navigation-assisted surgery   for the resection of pelvic bone tumours involving the posterior   ilium and sacrum. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using our prospectively updated institutional database, we conducted   a retrospective case control study of 21 patients who underwent   resection of the posterior ilium and sacrum, for the treatment of   a primary sarcoma of bone, between 1987 and 2015. The resection   was performed with the assistance of navigation in nine patients   and without navigation in 12. We assessed the accuracy of navigation-assisted   surgery, as defined by the surgical margin and how this affects   the rate of local recurrence, the disease-free survival and the   effects on peri-and post-operative morbidity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the patients was 36.4 years (15 to 66). The mean   size of the tumour was 10.9 cm. In the navigation-assisted group,   the margin was wide in two patients (16.7%), marginal in six (66.7%)   and wide-contaminated in one (11.1%) with no intralesional margin.   In the non-navigated-assisted group; the margin was wide in two   patients (16.7%), marginal in five (41.7%), intralesional in three   (25.0%) and wide-contaminated in two (16.7%). Local recurrence occurred   in two patients in the navigation-assisted group (22.2%) and six   in the non-navigation-assisted group (50.0%).

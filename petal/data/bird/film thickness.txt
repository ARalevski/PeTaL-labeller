Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss, who had pre-operative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively   compared with those with full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness   cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Genetic Architecture and Molecular Networks Underlying Leaf Thickness in Desert-Adapted Tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>er leaves allow plants to grow in water-limited conditions. However, our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this highly functional leaf shape trait is poor. We used a custom-built confocal profilometer to directly measure leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness in a set of introgression lines (ILs) derived from the desert tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i> and identified quantitative trait loci. We report evidence of a complex genetic architecture of this trait and roles for both genetic and environmental factors. Several ILs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> leaves have dramatically elongated palisade mesophyll cells and, in some cases, increased leaf ploidy. We characterized the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> IL2-5 and IL4-3 in detail and found increased mesophyll cell size and leaf ploidy levels, suggesting that endoreduplication underpins leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness in tomato. Next, we queried the transcriptomes and inferred dynamic Bayesian networks of gene expression across early leaf ontogeny in these lines to compare the molecular networks that pattern leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> ILs share <i>S. pennellii</i>-like expression profiles for putative regulators of cell shape and meristem determinacy as well as a general signature of cell cycle-related gene expression. However, our network data suggest that leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness in these two lines is patterned at least partially by distinct mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, double homozygote lines combining introgression segments from these two ILs show additive phenotypes, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> leaves, higher ploidy levels, and larger palisade mesophyll cells. Collectively, these data establish a framework of genetic, anatomical, and molecular mechanisms that pattern leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness in desert-adapted tomato.</p>

Tree Physiology
Root diameter variations explained by anatomy and phylogeny of 50 tropical and temperate tree species
<p>Root diameter, a critical indicator of root physiological function, varies greatly among tree species, but the underlying mechanism of this high variability is unclear. Here, we sampled 50 tree species across tropical and temperate zones in China, and measured root morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between root diameter, cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and stele diameter among tree species in tropical and temperate forests, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both root morphological and anatomical traits with divergence time during species radiation. The results showed that root diameter was strongly affected by cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness but less by stele diameter in both tropical and temperate species. Changes in cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness explained over 90% of variation in root diameter for the first order, and ∼74–87% for the second and third orders. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>er roots displayed greater cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and more cortical cell layers than thinner roots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that root diameter, cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with divergence time at the family level, showing similar variation trends in geological time. The results also suggested that trees tend to decrease their root cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness rather than stele diameter during species radiation. The close linkage of variations in root morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 tree species should provide some insights into the mechanism of root diameter variability among tree species.</p>

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

Compacted dimensions and singular plasmonic surfaces
<p>In advanced field theories, there can be more than four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions to space, the excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions described as compacted and unobservable on everyday length scales. We report a simple model, unconnected to field theory, for a compacted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ion realized in a metallic metasurface periodically structured in the form of a grating comprising a series of singularities. An extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ion of the grating is hidden, and the surface plasmon excitations, though localized at the surface, are characterized by three wave vectors rather than the two of typical two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ional metal grating. We propose an experimental realization in a doped graphene layer.</p>

Cold acclimation alters the connective tissue content of the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) heart
<p>Thermal acclimation can alter cardiac function and morphology in a number of fish species, but little is known about the regulation of these changes. The purpose of the present study was to determine how cold acclimation affects zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) cardiac morphology, collagen composition and connective tissue regulation. Heart volume, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the compact myocardium, collagen content and collagen fiber composition were compared between control (27°C) and cold-acclimated (20°C) zebrafish using serially sectioned hearts stained with Picrosirius Red. Collagen content and fiber composition of the pericardial membrane were also examined. Cold acclimation did not affect the volume of the contracted heart; however, there was a significant decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the compact myocardium. There was also a decrease in the collagen content of the compact myocardium and in the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> collagen fibers throughout the heart. Cold-acclimated zebrafish also increased expression of the gene transcript for matrix metalloproteinase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and collagen Type I α1. We propose that the reduction in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the compact myocardium as well as the change in collagen content may help to maintain the compliance of the ventricle as temperatures decrease. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the zebrafish heart undergoes significant remodeling in response to cold acclimation.</p>

Global Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Heart Failure and Preserved or Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We hypothesized that pulmonary venous hypertension in heart failure (HF) leads to predominate remodeling of pulmonary veins and that the severity of venous remodeling is associated with the severity of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with HF (n=108; 53 preserved and 55 reduced ejection fraction) with PH (HF-PH; pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] ≥40 mm Hg) were compared to normal controls (n=12) and patients with primary pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD; n=17). In lung specimens from autopsy (control, HF-PH, and 7 PVOD) or surgery (10 PVOD), quantitative histomorphometry was performed in all analyzable arteries (n=4949), veins (n=7630), and small indeterminate vessels (IV; n=2168) to define percent medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (arteries) and percent intimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (%IT) (arteries, veins, and IV) relative to external diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average arterial percent medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (control, 6.9; HF-PH, 11.0; PVOD, 15.0), arterial %IT (control, 4.9; HF-PH, 14.9; PVOD, 31.1), venous %IT (control, 14.0; HF-PH, 24.9; PVOD, 43.9), and IV %IT (control, 10.6; HF-PH, 25.8; PVOD, 50.0) in HF-PH were higher than controls (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but lower than PVOD (<i>P</i>≤0.005 for all). PASP (mm Hg) was lower in HF-PH (median, 59 [interquartile range, 50–70]) than in PVOD (median, 91 [interquartile range, 82–103]). PASP correlated with arterial percent medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (<i>r</i>=0.41) and arterial %IT (<i>r</i>=0.35) but more strongly with venous %IT (<i>r</i>=0.49) and IV %IT (<i>r</i>=0.55) (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all). Associations between PASP and venous or IV %IT remained significant after adjusting for arterial percent medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and %IT and did not vary by HF type. In patients with right heart catheterization (30 HF-PH, 14 PVOD), similar associations between the transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular remodeling existed, with numerically stronger associations for venous and IV %IT. Although the PASP was slightly higher in patients with HF-PH with right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary vascular remodeling was not more severe. Pulmonary vascular remodeling severity was associated with reductions in the diffusing capacity of the lungs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In HF, PH is associated with global pulmonary vascular remodeling, but the severity of PH correlates most strongly with venous and small IV intimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ening, similar to the pattern observed in PVOD.

Left Ventricular Structure and Function in Transthyretin-Related Versus Light-Chain Cardiac Amyloidosis
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Immunoglobulin amyloid light-chain (AL)-related cardiac amyloidosis (CA) has a worse prognosis than either wild-type (ATTRwt) or mutant (ATTRm) transthyretin (TTR) CA. Detailed echocardiographic studies have been performed in AL amyloidosis but not in TTR amyloidosis and might give insight into this difference. We assessed cardiac structure and function and outcome in a large population of patients with CA and compared findings in TTR and AL-related disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We analyzed 172 patients with CA (AL amyloidosis, n=80; ATTRm, n=36; ATTRwt, n=56) by standard echocardiography and 2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ional speckle-tracking imaging-derived left ventricular (LV) longitudinal (LS), radial, and circumferential strains. Despite a preserved LV ejection fraction (55±12%), LS was severely impaired in CA.

3D printed polyamide membranes for desalination
<p>Polyamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and roughness have been identified as critical properties that affect thin-film composite membrane performance for reverse osmosis. Conventional formation methodologies lack the ability to control these properties independently with high resolution or precision. An additive approach is presented that uses electrospraying to deposit monomers directly onto a substrate, where they react to form polyamide. The small droplet size coupled with low monomer concentrations result in polyamide films that are smoother and thinner than conventional polyamides, while the additive nature of the approach allows for control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and roughness. Polyamide films are formed with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness that is controllable down to 4-nanometer increments and a roughness as low as 2 nanometers while still exhibiting good permselectivity relative to a commercial benchmarking membrane.</p>

A unified continental thickness from seismology and diamonds suggests a melt-defined plate

Xenoliths suggest a chemical continental lithosphere ~175 kilometers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>, whereas seismic tomography supports a much <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>er root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled <i>SS</i> precursor waveforms from continental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at depths of 130 to 190 kilometers. The discontinuity depth is well correlated with the origin depths of diamond-bearing xenoliths and corresponds to the transition from coarse to deformed xenoliths. At this depth, the xenolith-derived geotherm also intersects the carbonate-silicate solidus, suggesting that partial melt defines the plate boundaries beneath the continental interior.</p>

Tunable intrinsic strain in two-dimensional transition metal electrocatalysts
<p>Tuning surface strain is a powerful strategy for tailoring the reactivity of metal catalysts. Traditionally, surface strain is imposed by external stress from a heterogeneous substrate, but the effect is often obscured by interfacial reconstructions and nanocatalyst geometries. Here, we report on a strategy to resolve these problems by exploiting intrinsic surface stresses in two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ional transition metal nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations indicate that attractive interactions between surface atoms lead to tensile surface stresses that exert a pressure on the order of 10<sup>5</sup> atmospheres on the surface atoms and impart up to 10% compressive strain, with the exact magnitude inversely proportional to the nanosheet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness. Atomic-level control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness thus enables generation and fine-tuning of intrinsic strain to optimize catalytic reactivity, which was confirmed experimentally on Pd(110) nanosheets for the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, with activity enhancements that were more than an order of magnitude greater than those of their nanoparticle counterparts.</p>

Cortical column and whole-brain imaging with molecular contrast and nanoscale resolution

These included synaptic proteins at dendritic spines, myelination along axons, and presynaptic densities at dopaminergic neurons in every fly brain region.

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials
<p>Although flakes of two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ional (2D) heterostructures at the micrometer scale can be formed with adhesive-tape exfoliation methods, isolation of 2D flakes into monolayers is extremely time consuming because it is a trial-and-error process. Controlling the number of 2D layers through direct growth also presents difficulty because of the high nucleation barrier on 2D materials. We demonstrate a layer-resolved 2D material splitting technique that permits high-throughput production of multiple monolayers of wafer-scale (5-centimeter diameter) 2D materials by splitting single stacks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> 2D materials grown on a single wafer. Wafer-scale uniformity of hexagonal boron nitride, tungsten disulfide, tungsten diselenide, molybdenum disulfide, and molybdenum diselenide monolayers was verified by photoluminescence response and by substantial retention of electronic conductivity.

A family of finite-temperature electronic phase transitions in graphene multilayers
<p>Suspended Bernal-stacked graphene multilayers up to an unexpectedly large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness exhibit a broken-symmetry ground state whose origin remains to be understood. We show that a finite-temperature second-order phase transition occurs in multilayers whose critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) increases from 12 kelvins (K) in bilayers to 100 K in heptalayers. A comparison of the data with a phenomenological model inspired by a mean-field approach suggests that the transition is associated with the appearance of a self-consistent valley- and spin-dependent staggered potential that changes sign from one layer to the next, appearing at <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> and increasing upon cooling. The systematic evolution with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of several measured quantities imposes constraints on any microscopic theory aiming to analyze the nature of electronic correlations in this system.</p>

This correlated variability was oriented along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions in population space used by the animal on a trial-by-trial basis to make decisions. That subjects’ choices were predicted by specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions that were aligned with the correlated variability axis clarifies long-standing paradoxes about the relationship between shared variability and behavior.</p>

Exposed subsurface ice sheets in the Martian mid-latitudes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> deposits cover broad regions of the Martian mid-latitudes with a smooth mantle; erosion in these regions creates scarps that expose the internal structure of the mantle. We investigated eight of these locations and found that they expose deposits of water ice that can be >100 meters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>, extending downward from depths as shallow as 1 to 2 meters below the surface. The scarps are actively retreating because of sublimation of the exposed water ice. The ice deposits likely originated as snowfall during Mars’ high-obliquity periods and have now compacted into massive, fractured, and layered ice. We expect the vertical structure of Martian ice-rich deposits to preserve a record of ice deposition and past climate.</p>

Observation of Anderson localization in disordered nanophotonic structures
<p>Anderson localization is an interference effect crucial to the understanding of waves in disordered media. However, localization is expected to become negligible when the features of the disordered structure are much smaller than the wavelength. Here we experimentally demonstrate the localization of light in a disordered dielectric multilayer with an average layer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of 15 nanometers, deep into the subwavelength regime. We observe strong disorder-induced reflections that show that the interplay of localization and evanescence can lead to a substantial decrease in transmission, or the opposite feature of enhanced transmission. This deep-subwavelength Anderson localization exhibits extreme sensitivity: Varying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of a single layer by 2 nanometers changes the reflection appreciably. This sensitivity, approaching the atomic scale, holds the promise of extreme subwavelength sensing.</p>

The physical properties of light with a helical wavefront can be confined onto two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ional surfaces with subwavelength <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions in the form of plasmonic vortices, opening avenues for thus far unknown light-matter interactions. Because of their extreme rotational velocity, the ultrafast dynamics of such vortices remained unexplored. Here we show the detailed spatiotemporal evolution of nanovortices using time-resolved two-photon photoemission electron microscopy. We observe both long- and short-range plasmonic vortices confined to deep subwavelength <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions on the scale of 100 nanometers with nanometer spatial resolution and subfemtosecond time-step resolution. Finally, by measuring the angular velocity of the vortex, we directly extract the OAM magnitude of light.</p>

Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> across the Mesophyll-Bundle Sheath Cell Interface in a C<sub>4</sub> Plant with Genetically Reduced PEP Carboxylase Activity
<p>Phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), localized to the cytosol of the mesophyll cell, catalyzes the first carboxylation step of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used RNA interference to target the cytosolic photosynthetic PEPC isoform in <i>Setaria viridis</i> and isolated independent transformants with very low PEPC activities. These plants required high ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for growth, consistent with the essential role of PEPC in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The combination of estimating direct CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by the bundle sheath using gas-exchange measurements and modeling C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis with low PEPC activity allowed the calculation of bundle sheath conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>) in the progeny of these plants. Measurements made at a range of temperatures suggested no or negligible effect of temperature on <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> depending on the technique used to calculate <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. Anatomical measurements revealed that plants with reduced PEPC activity had reduced cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and increased plasmodesmata (PD) density at the mesophyll-bundle sheath (M-BS) cell interface, whereas we observed little difference in these parameters at the mesophyll-mesophyll cell interface. The increased PD density at the M-BS interface was largely driven by an increase in the number of PD pit fields (cluster of PDs) rather than an increase in PD per pit field or the size of pit fields. The correlation of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> with bundle sheath surface area per leaf area and PD area per M-BS area showed that these parameters and cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness are important determinants of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. It is intriguing to speculate that PD development is responsive to changes in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic flux.</p>

Apparent Overinvestment in Leaf Venation Relaxes Leaf Morphological Constraints on Photosynthesis in Arid Habitats
<p>Leaf veins supply the mesophyll with water that evaporates when stomata are open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Theoretical analyses suggest that water is optimally distributed in the mesophyll when the lateral distance between veins (<i>d</i><sub>x</sub>) is equal to the distance from these veins to the epidermis (<i>d</i><sub>y</sub>), expressed as <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ≈ 1. Although this theory is supported by observations of many derived angiosperms, we hypothesize that plants in arid environments may reduce <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> below unity owing to climate-specific functional adaptations of increased leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and increased vein density. To test our hypothesis, we assembled leaf hydraulic, morphological, and photosynthetic traits of 68 species from the <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Corymbia</i> genera (termed eucalypts) along an aridity gradient in southwestern Australia. We inferred the potential gas-exchange advantage of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> using a model that links leaf morphology and hydraulics to photosynthesis. Our observations reveal that eucalypts in arid environments have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> amphistomatous leaves with high vein densities, resulting in <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ratios that range from 1.6 to 0.15 along the aridity gradient. Our model suggests that, as leaves become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>er, the effect of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> is to offset the reduction in leaf gas exchange that would result from maintaining <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> at unity. This apparent overinvestment in leaf venation may be explained from the selective pressure of aridity, under which traits associated with long leaf life span, high hydraulic and thermal capacitances, and high potential rates of leaf water transport confer a competitive advantage.</p>

Quantification of the ossification of the lateral cuneiform in the feet of young children with unilateral congenital talipes equinovarus
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>After the initial correction of congenital talipes equinovarus   (CTEV) using the Ponseti method, a subsequent dynamic deformity   is often managed by transfer of the tendon of tibialis anterior   (TATT) to the lateral cuneiform. Many surgeons believe the lateral   cuneiform should be ossified before surgery is undertaken. This   study quantifies the ossification process of the lateral cuneiform   in children with CTEV between one and three years of age. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The length, width and height of the lateral cuneiform were measured   in 43 consecutive patients with unilateral CTEV who had been treated   using the Ponseti method. Measurements were taken by two independent   observers on standardised anteroposterior and lateral radiographs   of both feet taken at one, two and three years of age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions of the lateral cuneiform on the affected side   increased annually but remained smaller than the corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions   of the unaffected foot (p < 0.01). The lateral cuneiform resembled   a 9 mm cube at two years and an 11 mm cube at three years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>At one and two years, the ossification centre of the lateral   cuneiform may not be large enough to accommodate a drill hole for   tendon transfer.

External rotation of the femoral component increases asymmetry of the posterior condyles
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The morphometry of the distal femur was largely studied to improve   bone-implant fit in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), but little is   known about the asymmetry of the posterior condyles. This study   aimed to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions of the posterior condyles and   the influence of externally rotating the femoral component on potential prosthetic   overhang or under-coverage.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed the shape of 110 arthritic knees at the time of primary   TKA using pre-operative CT scans. The height and width of each condyle   were measured at the posterior femoral cut in neutral position,   and in 3º and 5º of external rotation, using both central and medial   referencing systems.

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteoarthritis   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Our aim was to   investigate the long-term outcome of a consecutive series of patients,   some of whom had anterior knee pain and PFJ OA managed with UKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We assessed the ten-year functional outcomes and 15-year implant   survival of 805 knees (677 patients) following medial mobile-bearing   UKA. The intra-operative status of the PFJ was documented and, with   the exception of bone loss with grooving to the lateral side, neither   the clinical or radiological state of the PFJ nor the presence of   anterior knee pain were considered a contraindication. The impact   of radiographic findings and anterior knee pain was studied in a   subgroup of 100 knees (91 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no relationship between functional outcomes, at a mean   of ten years, or 15-year implant survival, and pre-operative anterior   knee pain, or the presence or degree of cartilage loss documented   intra-operatively at the medial patella or trochlea, or radiographic   evidence of OA in the medial side of the PFJ. In 6% of cases there   was full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss on the lateral side of the patella.   In these cases, the overall ten-year function and 15-year survival   was similar to those without cartilage loss; however they had slightly   more difficulty with descending stairs.

Less   severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ and damage to the medial   side, however severe, does not compromise the overall function or   survival, so should not be considered to be a contraindication. However,   if a patient does have full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss on the lateral   side of the PFJ they may have a slight compromise in their ability   to descend stairs.

Physiological Right Ventricular Adaptation in Elite Athletes of African and Afro-Caribbean Origin
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Regular, intensive exercise results in physiological biventricular cardiac adaptation. Ethnicity is an established determinant of left ventricular remodeling; black athletes (BAs) exhibit more profound LV hypertrophy than white athletes (WAs). Right ventricular (RV) remodeling has not been characterized in BAs, although the issue is pertinent because BAs commonly exhibit ECG anomalies that resemble arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Between 2006 and 2012, 300 consecutive BAs (n=243 males) from 25 sporting disciplines were evaluated by use of ECG and echocardiography. Results were compared with 375 WAs and 153 sedentary control subjects (n=69 blacks). There were no ethnic differences between RV parameters in control subjects. Both BAs and WAs exhibited greater RV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions than control subjects. RV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions were marginally smaller in BAs than in WAs (proximal outflow tract, 30.9±5.5 versus 32.8±5.3 mm, <i>P</i><0.001; longitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ion, 86.6±9.5 versus 89.8±9.6 mm, <i>P</i><0.001), although only 2.3% of variation was attributable to ethnicity. RV enlargement compatible with diagnostic criteria for arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy was frequently observed (proximal outflow tract ≥32 mm; 45.0% of BAs, 58.5% of WAs). Anterior T-wave inversion was present in 14.3% of BAs versus 3.7% of WAs (<i>P</i><0.001). Marked RV enlargement with concomitant anterior T-wave inversion was observed in 3.0% of BAs versus 0.3% of WAs (<i>P</i>=0.005). Further investigation did not diagnose arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy in any athlete.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Physiological RV enlargement is commonly observed in both black and white athletes. The impact of ethnicity is minimal, which obviates the need for race-specific RV reference values. However, in the context of frequent ECG repolarization anomalies in BAs, the potential for erroneous diagnosis of arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy is considerably greater in this ethnic group.</p></sec>

Beyond Porosity: 3D Leaf Intercellular Airspace Traits That Impact Mesophyll Conductance
<p>The leaf intercellular airspace (IAS) is generally considered to have high conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion relative to the liquid phase. While previous studies accounted for leaf-level variation in porosity and mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness, they omitted 3D IAS traits that potentially influence IAS conductance (g<sub>IAS</sub>). Here, we reevaluated the standard equation for g<sub>IAS</sub> by incorporating tortuosity, lateral path lengthening, and IAS connectivity. We measured and spatially mapped these geometric IAS traits for 19 Bromeliaceae species with Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) or C3 photosynthetic pathways using x-ray microcomputed tomography imaging and a novel computational approach. We found substantial variation in porosity (0.04–0.73 m<sup>3</sup> m<sup>−3</sup>), tortuosity (1.09–3.33 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>), lateral path lengthening (1.12–3.19 m m<sup>−1</sup>), and IAS connectivity (0.81–0.97 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>) across all bromeliad leaves. The revised g<sub>IAS</sub> model predicted significantly lower g<sub>IAS</sub> in CAM (0.01–0.19 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) than in C3 (0.41–2.38 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) plants due to a coordinated decline in these IAS traits. Our reevaluated equation also generally predicted lower g<sub>IAS</sub> values than the former one. Moreover, we observed high spatial heterogeneity in these IAS geometric traits throughout the mesophyll, especially within CAM leaves. Our data show that IAS traits that better capture the 3D complexity of leaves strongly influence g<sub>IAS</sub> and that the impact of the IAS on mesophyll conductance should be carefully considered with respect to leaf anatomy. We provide a simple function to estimate tortuosity and lateral path lengthening in the absence of access to imaging tools such as x-ray microcomputed tomography or other novel 3D image-processing techniques.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed coat’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed coat, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed coat pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed coat development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed coat permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

Soft X-Ray Imaging of Cellular Carbon and Nitrogen Distributions in Heterocystous Cyanobacteria
<p>Soft x-ray microscopy (SXM) is a minimally invasive technique for single-cell high-resolution imaging as well as the visualization of intracellular distributions of light elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We used SXM to observe photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in the filamentous cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120, which can form heterocysts during nitrogen starvation. Statistical and spectroscopic analyses from SXM images around the K-absorption edge of nitrogen revealed a significant difference in the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio between vegetative cells and heterocysts. Application of this analysis to soft x-ray images of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 revealed inhomogenous C/N ratios in the cells. Furthermore, soft x-ray tomography of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 revealed differing cellular C/N ratios, indicating different carbon and nitrogen distributions between vegetative cells and heterocysts in three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions.</p>

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with elongation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial gradients for elongation rate, osmotic pressure, cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness, and wall mechanical compliances and coupled these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the polysaccharide composition, mobility, hydration, and intermolecular interactions of the inflorescence cell wall using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering. Force-extension curves revealed a gradient, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-scattering curves showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal gradient in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

The Conserved and Unique Genetic Architecture of Kernel Size and Weight in Maize and Rice
<p>Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a major staple crop. Maize kernel size and weight are important contributors to its yield. Here, we measured kernel length, kernel width, kernel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness, hundred kernel weight, and kernel test weight in 10 recombinant inbred line populations and dissected their genetic architecture using three statistical models. In total, 729 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, many of which were identified in all three models, including 22 major QTLs that each can explain more than 10% of phenotypic variation. To provide candidate genes for these QTLs, we identified 30 maize genes that are orthologs of 18 rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes reported to affect rice seed size or weight. Interestingly, 24 of these 30 genes are located in the identified QTLs or within 1 Mb of the significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We further confirmed the effects of five genes on maize kernel size/weight in an independent association mapping panel with 540 lines by candidate gene association analysis. Lastly, the function of <i>ZmINCW1</i>, a homolog of rice <i>GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING1</i> that affects seed size and weight, was characterized in detail. <i>ZmINCW1</i> is close to QTL peaks for kernel size/weight (less than 1 Mb) and contains significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting kernel size/weight in the association panel. Overexpression of this gene can rescue the reduced weight of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homozygous mutant line in the <i>AtcwINV2</i> gene (Arabidopsis ortholog of <i>ZmINCW1</i>). These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms affecting seed development are conserved in maize, rice, and possibly Arabidopsis.</p>

Photosynthetic Efficiency as Bioindicator of Environmental Pressure in <i>A. halleri</i>
<p>In earlier ecophysiological studies that were conducted on <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> plants, scientists focused on the mechanisms of Cd and Zn hyperaccumulation but did not take into consideration the environmental factors that can significantly affect the physiological responses of plants in situ. In this study, we investigated <i>A. halleri</i> that was growing on two nonmetalliferous and three metalliferous sites, which were characterized by different environmental conditions. We compared these populations in order to find differences within the metallicolous and nonmetallicolous groups that have not yet been investigated. The concentrations of several elements in the plant and soil samples also were investigated. To our knowledge, the concentration and fluorescence of chlorophyll were measured for <i>A. halleri</i> in situ for the first time. Our study confirmed the hyperaccumulation of Cd and Zn for each metallicolous population. For the metallicolous populations, the inhibition of parameters that describe the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus with increasing accumulations of heavy metals in the shoots also was observed. It was found that the nonmetallicolous plant populations from the summit of Ciemniak Mountain had larger antenna <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions and chlorophyll content but a lower percentage of active reaction centers. To our knowledge, in this study, the internal high physiological diversity within the populations that inhabit metalliferous and nonmetalliferous sites is presented for the first time.</p>

Defining the Diverse Cell Populations Contributing to Lignification in Arabidopsis Stems<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many land plants evolved tall and sturdy growth habits due to specialized cells with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> lignified cell walls: tracheary elements that function in water transport and fibers that function in structural support. The objective of this study was to define how and when diverse cell populations contribute lignin precursors, monolignols, to secondary cell walls during lignification of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inflorescence stem. Previous work demonstrated that, when lignin biosynthesis is suppressed in fiber and tracheary element cells with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ened walls, fibers become lignin-depleted while vascular bundles still lignify, suggesting that nonlignifying neighboring xylem cells are contributing to lignification. In this work, we dissect the contributions of different cell types, specifically xylary parenchyma and fiber cells, to lignification of the stem using cell-type-specific promoters to either knock down an essential monolignol biosynthetic gene or to introduce novel monolignol conjugates. Analysis of either reductions in lignin in knockdown lines, or the addition of novel monolignol conjugates, directly identifies the xylary parenchyma and fiber cell populations that contribute to the stem lignification and the developmental timing at which each contribution is most important.</p>

EXO70C2 Is a Key Regulatory Factor for Optimal Tip Growth of Pollen
<p>The exocyst, a eukaryotic tethering complex, coregulates targeted exocytosis as an effector of small GTPases in polarized cell growth. In land plants, several exocyst subunits are encoded by double or triple paralogs, culminating in tens of EXO70 paralogs. Out of 23 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> EXO70 isoforms, we analyzed seven isoforms expressed in pollen. Genetic and microscopic analyses of single mutants in <i>EXO70A2</i>, <i>EXO70C1</i>, <i>EXO70C2</i>, <i>EXO70F1</i>, <i>EXO70H3</i>, <i>EXO70H5</i>, and <i>EXO70H6</i> genes revealed that only a loss-of-function <i>EXO70C2</i> allele resulted in a significant male-specific transmission defect (segregation 40%:51%:9%) due to aberrant pollen tube growth. Mutant pollen tubes grown in vitro exhibited an enhanced growth rate and a decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the tip cell wall, causing tip bursts. However, <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes could frequently recover and restart their speedy elongation, resulting in a repetitive stop-and-go growth dynamics. A pollen-specific depletion of the closest paralog, <i>EXO70C1</i>, using artificial microRNA in the <i>exo70C2</i> mutant background, resulted in a complete pollen-specific transmission defect, suggesting redundant functions of EXO70C1 and EXO70C2. Both EXO70C1 and EXO70C2, GFP tagged and expressed under the control of their native promoters, localized in the cytoplasm of pollen grains, pollen tubes, and also root trichoblast cells. The expression of EXO70C2-GFP complemented the aberrant growth of <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes. The absent EXO70C2 interactions with core exocyst subunits in the yeast two-hybrid assay, cytoplasmic localization, and genetic effect suggest an unconventional EXO70 function possibly as a regulator of exocytosis outside the exocyst complex. In conclusion, EXO70C2 is a novel factor contributing to the regulation of optimal tip growth of Arabidopsis pollen tubes.</p>

Connecting the Molecular Structure of Cutin to Ultrastructure and Physical Properties of the Cuticle in Petals of Arabidopsis
<p>The plant cuticle is laid down at the cell wall surface of epidermal cells in a wide variety of structures, but the functional significance of this architectural diversity is not yet understood. Here, the structure-function relationship of the petal cuticle of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was investigated. Applying Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, the cutin mutants <i>long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetase2</i> (<i>lacs2</i>), <i>permeable cuticle1 (pec1)</i>, <i>cyp77a6</i>, <i>glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase6</i> (<i>gpat6</i>), and <i>defective in cuticular ridges</i> (<i>dcr</i>) were grouped in three separate classes based on quantitative differences in the ν(C=O) and ν(C-H) band vibrations. These were associated mainly with the quantity of 10,16-dihydroxy hexadecanoic acid, a monomer of the cuticle polyester, cutin. These spectral features were linked to three different types of cuticle organization: a normal cuticle with nanoridges (<i>lacs2</i> and <i>pec1</i> mutants); a broad translucent cuticle (<i>cyp77a6</i> and <i>dcr</i> mutants); and an electron-opaque multilayered cuticle (<i>gpat6</i> mutant). The latter two types did not have typical nanoridges. Transmission electron microscopy revealed considerable variations in cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness in the <i>dcr</i> mutant. Different double mutant combinations showed that a low amount of C16 monomers in cutin leads to the appearance of an electron-translucent layer adjacent to the cuticle proper, which is independent of DCR action. We concluded that DCR is not only essential for incorporating 10,16-dihydroxy C16:0 into cutin but also plays a crucial role in the organization of the cuticle, independent of cutin composition. Further characterization of the mutant petals suggested that nanoridge formation and conical cell shape may contribute to the reduction of physical adhesion forces between petals and other floral organs during floral development.</p>

Gibberellin Signaling Requires Chromatin Remodeler PICKLE to Promote Vegetative Growth and Phase Transitions
<p>PICKLE (PKL) is an ATP-dependent chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding domain (CHD3) chromatin remodeling enzyme in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Previous studies showed that PKL promotes embryonic-to-vegetative transition by inhibiting expression of seed-specific genes during seed germination. The <i>pkl</i> mutants display a low penetrance of the “pickle root” phenotype, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> and green primary root that retains embryonic characteristics. The penetrance of this pickle root phenotype in <i>pkl</i> is dramatically increased in gibberellin (GA)-deficient conditions. At adult stages, the <i>pkl</i> mutants are semidwarfs with delayed flowering time, which resemble reduced GA-signaling mutants. These findings suggest that PKL may play a positive role in regulating GA signaling. A recent biochemical analysis further showed that PKL and GA signaling repressors DELLAs antagonistically regulate hypocotyl cell elongation genes by direct protein-protein interaction. To elucidate further the role of PKL in GA signaling and plant development, we studied the genetic interaction between PKL and DELLAs using the hextuple mutant containing <i>pkl</i> and <i>della</i> pentuple (<i>dP</i>) mutations. Here, we show that PKL is required for most of GA-promoted developmental processes, including vegetative growth such as hypocotyl, leaf, and inflorescence stem elongation, and phase transitions such as juvenile-to-adult leaf and vegetative-to-reproductive phase. The removal of all DELLA functions (in the <i>dP</i> background) cannot rescue these phenotypes in <i>pkl</i>. RNA-sequencing analysis using the <i>ga1</i> (a GA-deficient mutant), <i>pkl</i>, and the <i>ga1 pkl</i> double mutant further shows that expression of 80% of GA-responsive genes in seedlings is PKL dependent, including genes that function in cell elongation, cell division, and phase transitions. These results indicate that the CHD3 chromatin remodeler PKL is required for regulating gene expression during most of GA-regulated developmental processes.</p>

DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) Regulates Cell Walls in the Leaf Epidermis
<p>The plant epidermis is crucial to survival, regulating interactions with the environment and controlling plant growth. The phytocalpain DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) is a master regulator of epidermal differentiation and maintenance, acting upstream of epidermis-specific transcription factors, and is required for correct cell adhesion. It is currently unclear how changes in DEK1 lead to cellular defects in the epidermis and the pathways through which DEK1 acts. We have combined growth kinematic studies, cell wall analysis, and transcriptional analysis of genes downstream of DEK1 to determine the cause of phenotypic changes observed in DEK1-modulated lines of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We reveal a novel role for DEK1 in the regulation of leaf epidermal cell wall structure. Lines with altered DEK1 activity have epidermis-specific changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and polysaccharide composition of cell walls that likely underlie the loss of adhesion between epidermal cells in plants with reduced levels of DEK1 and changes in leaf shape and size in plants constitutively overexpressing the active CALPAIN domain of DEK1. Calpain-overexpressing plants also have increased levels of cellulose and pectins in epidermal cell walls, and this is correlated with the expression of several cell wall-related genes, linking transcriptional regulation downstream of DEK1 with cellular effects. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the role of the epidermal cell walls in growth regulation and establish a new role for DEK1 in pathways regulating epidermal cell wall deposition and remodeling.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the liquid-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies.</p>

Activity levels and return to work following total knee arthroplasty in patients under 65 years of age
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about employment following total knee arthroplasty   (TKA). This study aims to identify factors which predict return   to work following TKA in patients of working age in the United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients & Methods</title><p>We prospectively assessed 289 patients (289 TKAs) aged ≤ 65 years   who underwent TKA between 2010 and 2013. There were 148 women. The   following were recorded pre-operatively: age, gender, body mass   index, social deprivation, comorbidities, indication for surgery,   work status and nature of employment, activity level as assessed by   the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score   and Oxford Knee Score (OKS). The intention of patients to return   to work or to retire was not assessed pre-operatively. At a mean   of 3.4 years (2 to 4) post-operatively, the return to work status,   OKS, the EuroQol-5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions (EQ-5D) score, UCLA activity score   and Work, Osteoarthritis and joint-Replacement (WORQ) score were   obtained.

A total   of 108 (41%) retired following TKA and 18 remained on welfare. Patients   not working before the operation did not return to work. Median   UCLA scores improved in 125 patients (58%) from 4 (mild activity)   to 6 (moderate activity) (p < 0.001). Significant    (p < 0.05) factors which were predictive of return to any work   included age, heavy or moderate manual work, better post-operative   UCLA, OKS and EQ-5D general health scores. Significant predictive   factors of return to the same work included age, heavy or moderate   manual work and post-operative OKS. Multivariate analysis confirmed   heavy or moderate manual work and age to independently predict a   return to either any or the same work. All patients aged < 50   years who were working pre-operatively returned to any work as did   60% of those aged between 50 and 54 years, 50% of those aged between   55 and 59 years and 24% those aged between 60 and 65 years. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>If working pre-operatively, patients aged < 50 years invariably   returned to work following TKA, but only half of those aged between   50 to 60 years returned.

Assessing treatment outcomes using a single question
<p>Satisfaction with care is important to both patients   and to those who pay for it. The Net Promoter Score (NPS), widely   used in the service industries, has been introduced into the NHS   as the ‘friends and family test’; an overarching measure of patient   satisfaction. It assesses the likelihood of the patient recommending   the healthcare received to another, and is seen as a discriminator   of healthcare performance. We prospectively assessed 6186 individuals   undergoing primary lower limb joint replacement at a single university   hospital to determine the Net Promoter Score for joint replacements   and to evaluate which factors contributed to the response. </p><p>Achieving pain relief (odds ratio (OR) 2.13, confidence interval   (CI) 1.83 to 2.49), the meeting of pre-operative expectation (OR   2.57, CI 2.24 to 2.97), and the hospital experience (OR 2.33, CI   2.03 to 2.68) are the domains that explain whether a patient would   recommend joint replacement services. These three factors, combined   with the type of surgery undertaken (OR 2.31, CI 1.68 to 3.17),   drove a predictive model that was able to explain 95% of the variation   in the patient’s recommendation response. Though intuitively similar,   this ‘recommendation’ metric was found to be materially different   to satisfaction responses. The difference between THR (NPS 71) and   TKR (NPS 49) suggests that no overarching score for a department   should be used without an adjustment for case mix. However, the   Net Promoter Score does measure a further important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ion to   our existing metrics: the patient experience of healthcare delivery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:622–8.</p>

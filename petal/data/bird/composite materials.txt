Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator transition in correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition. This coupling not only complicates the understanding of the basic mechanism of this phenomenon but also limits the speed and endurance of prospective electronic devices. We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator transition in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an interface interaction suppresses the electronic correlations without changing the crystal structure in this otherwise correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator. This interaction stabilizes a nonequilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic phase and leads to an isostructural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator transition. This discovery will provide insights into phase transitions of correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als and may aid the design of device functionalities.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing either solutions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al or precursors to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial component fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

As peri-apatite (PA)   is solution deposited, this may increase the coverage of the implant   surface and thereby fixation.

In 60   patients (30 in each group), radiostereometric analysis of tibial   component migration was evaluated as the primary outcome at baseline,   three months post-operatively and at one, two and five years. A   linear mixed-effects model was used to analyse the repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After five years of follow-up, one (cemented) component was revised   due to ligament instability. Overall, uncemented PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial   components migrated significantly more    (p = 0.003), with the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) at   five years being 0.62 mm (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to   0.76) for cemented tibial components and 0.97 mm (95% CI 0.81 to   1.15) for PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial components in TKA. However, between three   months and five years the cemented TKAs migrated significantly more   (p = 0.02), displaying a MTPM of 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.36) <i>versus</i> 0.13   mm (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.25) for PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial components.

Biological fabrication of cellulose fibers with tailored properties
<p>Cotton is a promising basis for wearable smart textiles. Current approaches that rely on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ings suffer from function loss during wear. We present an approach that allows biological incorporation of exogenous molecules into cotton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s to tailor the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al’s functionality. In vitro model cultures of upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) are incubated with 6-carboxyfluorescein–glucose and dysprosium–1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid–glucose, where the glucose moiety acts as a carrier capable of traveling from the vascular connection to the outermost cell layer of the ovule epidermis, becoming incorporated into the cellulose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s. This yields <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s with unnatural properties such as fluorescence or magnetism. Combining biological systems with the appropriate molecular design offers numerous possibilities to grow functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als and implements a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al-farming concept.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-on-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluation)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluation).   Changes in ion levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regression model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per billion (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relationship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.   While those with a MoM THA appear to stabilise at a certain level,   the accuracy of this trend is not yet clear.

High-Fiber Diet and Acetate Supplementation Change the Gut Microbiota and Prevent the Development of Hypertension and Heart Failure in Hypertensive Mice
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Dietary intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with lower incidence of hypertension, but the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Here, we evaluated the effect of a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> diet and supplementation with the short-chain fatty acid acetate on the gut microbiota and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gut microbiome, cardiorenal structure/function, and blood pressure were examined in sham and mineralocorticoid excess–treated mice with a control diet, high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> diet, or acetate supplementation. We also determined the renal and cardiac transcriptome of mice treated with the different diets.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that high consumption of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> modified the gut microbiota populations and increased the abundance of acetate-producing bacteria independently of mineralocorticoid excess. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> and acetate decreased gut dysbiosis, measured by the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and increased the prevalence of <i>Bacteroides acidifaciens</i>. Compared with mineralocorticoid-excess mice fed a control diet, both high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> diet and acetate supplementation significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures, cardiac fibrosis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Acetate had similar effects and markedly reduced renal fibrosis. Transcriptome analyses showed that the protective effects of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> and acetate were accompanied by the downregulation of cardiac and renal <i>Egr1</i>, a master cardiovascular regulator involved in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiorenal fibrosis, and inflammation. We also observed the upregulation of a network of genes involved in circadian rhythm in both tissues and downregulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A diet high in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> led to changes in the gut microbiota that played a protective role in the development of cardiovascular disease. The favorable effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> may be explained by the generation and distribution of one of the main metabolites of the gut microbiota, the short-chain fatty acid acetate. Acetate effected several molecular changes associated with imp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rove</span></strong>d cardiovascular health and function.</p></sec>

Current-induced strong diamagnetism in the Mott insulator Ca<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>
<p>Mott <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ators can host a surprisingly diverse set of quantum phenomena when their frozen electrons are perturbed by various stimuli. Superconductivity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator transition, and colossal magnetoresistance induced by element substitution, pressure, and magnetic field are prominent examples. Here we report strong diamagnetism in the Mott <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator calcium ruthenate (Ca<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>) induced by dc electric current. The application of a current density of merely 1 ampere per centimeter squared induces diamagnetism stronger than that in other nonsuperconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. This change is coincident with changes in the transport properties as the system becomes semi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic. These findings suggest that dc current may be a means to control the properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als in the vicinity of a Mott <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ating transition.</p>

Tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices pinch collagen fibers to support 3D cell migration
<p>Migrating cells often use focal adhesions in order to move. Focal adhesions are less prominent in cells migrating in three-dimensional (3D) as compared with 2D environments. We looked for alternative adhesion structures supporting cell migration. We analyzed the dynamics of clathrin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed pits in cells migrating in a 3D environment of collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s. Both topological cues and local engagement of integrins triggered the accumulation of clathrin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed structures on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s. Clathrin/adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) lattices pinched collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s by adopting a tube-like morphology and regulated adhesion to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s in an endocytosis-independent manner. During migration, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices stabilized cellular protrusions by providing anchoring points to collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s. Thus, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices promote cell adhesion that, in coordination with focal adhesions, supports cell migration in 3D.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The porosity of wood cell walls is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als perspective. The movement of water in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous networks formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and open conduits created by vessels and perforation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, water can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> cell walls; however, these micropore networks are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the distribution of micropores in the secondary walls and middle lamellae of tracheids and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s in relation to cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion. Using two different types of probe, we identified a greater porosity of secondary cell walls and a reduced porosity of the middle lamella. Areas of reduced porosity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell wall of both tracheids and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s that appear unrelated to lignification or the distribution of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> cell walls were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to porosity probes. Vessel cell walls were comparable to those of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s in terms of both porosity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell wall porosity in xylem. The highly lignified middle lamella, and lumen surface, act as a barrier to probe movement and, therefore, water movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p>Water storage is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant water balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to water storage can be derived from rehydration and water-release curves on excised plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with water, water uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high water storage capacitance was associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and water storage. In contrast, refilling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that storage compartments for capillary water refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain storage compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

Heavy Metals Induce Iron Deficiency Responses at Different Hierarchic and Regulatory Levels
<p>In plants, the excess of several heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s mimics iron (Fe) deficiency-induced chlorosis, indicating a disturbance in Fe homeostasis. To examine the level at which heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s interfere with Fe deficiency responses, we carried out an in-depth characterization of Fe-related physiological, regulatory, and morphological responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exposed to heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s. Enhanced zinc (Zn) uptake closely mimicked Fe deficiency by leading to low chlorophyll but high ferric-chelate reductase activity and coumarin release. These responses were not caused by Zn-inhibited Fe uptake via IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER (IRT1). Instead, Zn simulated the transcriptional response of typical Fe-regulated genes, indicating that Zn affects Fe homeostasis at the level of Fe sensing. Excess supplies of cobalt and nickel altered root traits in a different way from Fe deficiency, inducing only transient Fe deficiency responses, which were characterized by a lack of induction of the ethylene pathway. Cadmium showed a rather inconsistent influence on Fe deficiency responses at multiple levels. By contrast, manganese evoked weak Fe deficiency responses in wild-type plants but strongly exacerbated chlorosis in <i>irt1</i> plants, indicating that manganese antagonized Fe mainly at the level of transport. These results show that the investigated heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s modulate Fe deficiency responses at different hierarchic and regulatory levels and that the interaction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s with physiological and morphological Fe deficiency responses is uncoupled. Thus, this study not only emphasizes the importance of assessing heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> toxicities at multiple levels but also provides a new perspective on how Fe deficiency contributes to the toxic action of individual heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s.</p>

Satellite cell activation and populations on single muscle-fiber cultures from adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)
<p>Satellite cells (SCs), stem cells in skeletal muscle, are mitotically quiescent in adult mammals until activated for growth or regeneration. In mouse muscle, SCs are activated by nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the mechanically induced NO–HGF signaling cascade. Here, the SC population on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s from the adult, ectothermic zebrafish and SC responsiveness to activating stimuli were assessed using the model system of isolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s cultured at 27 and 21°C. SCs were identified by immunostaining for the HGF receptor, c-met, and activation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine uptake in culture or <i>in vivo</i>. In dose–response studies, SC activation was increased by treatment with the NO-donor drug isosorbide dinitrate (1 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) or HGF (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) to maximum activation at lower concentrations of both than in previous studies of mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s. HGF-induced activation was blocked by anti-c-met antibody, and reduced by culture at 21°C. The effect of cyclical stretch (3 h at 4 cycles per minute) increased activation and was blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibition and reduced by culture at 21°C. The number of c-met+ SCs per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> increased rapidly (by 3 h) after stretching. The character of signaling in SC activation on zebrafish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s, in particular temperature-dependent responses to HGF and stretch, gives new insights into the influence of ectothermy on regulation of muscle growth in teleosts and suggests the use of the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> model system to explore the basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> hyperplasia and the conservation of regulatory pathways between species.</p>

Highly variable chemical signatures over short spatial distances among Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) populations
<p>Understanding within-species variability in terpenoid content and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion is highly relevant for predicting species adaptive potential to biotic stresses, but there is still limited information on terpene variations even for widespread species. We studied the foliage content and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion of terpenoids, foliage structure, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L. in four Estonian sites ranging from dry forest to raised bog. In the bogs, samples were taken along the environmental gradient from drier margins towards wetter central parts. A chiral column was used to gain insight into the variation in terpene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion. We hypothesized that terpene contents increase and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion becomes more diverse in more strongly N-limited sites (greater C/N ratio) and that terpene signatures cluster together in sub-sites with similar conditions (drier/wetter). Altogether 37 terpenes were quantified across the sites. Extremely large variability of terpene contents, 48–62% for monoterpenes and 61–89% for sesquiterpenes, was observed. According to the amounts of α-pinenes and (+)-3-carene, we distinguished two different ‘pine chemotypes’. Contrary to the hypothesis, terpene contents and variability were the greatest in the dry site with the lowest C/N ratio. However, individual terpenoids correlated differently with C or N in different sites, indicating site effects on terpene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion. Moreover, correlations between the terpenoids and C or N depended on the pine chemotype. The sub-sites with different water regime were more strongly clustered together within the site than across the sites. The study demonstrates extensive variations in terpene contents and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion among the populations and over short spatial distances within the populations, suggesting a large among- and within-population adaptive capacity of <i>P. sylvestris</i>.</p>

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator
<p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s, orbital motions of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in magnetic fields, which is manifested by quantum oscillations in electrical resistivity. This Landau quantization is generally absent in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ators. Here, we report a notable exception in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator—ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB<sub>12</sub>). The resistivity of YbB<sub>12</sub>, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s, exhibits distinct quantum oscillations. These unconventional oscillations arise from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ating bulk, even though the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s with a large effective mass. Quantum oscillations in the magnetic torque are also observed, albeit with a lighter effective mass.</p>

A liquid metal reaction environment for the room-temperature synthesis of atomically thin metal oxides
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) oxides have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many oxides are not easy to synthesize as 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based alloys as a reaction solvent and co-alloyed desired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s into the melt. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, we predicted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion of the self-limiting interfacial oxide. We isolated the surface oxide as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in suspension. This enabled us to produce extremely thin subnanometer layers of HfO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>–based reaction route can be used to create 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als that were previously inaccessible with preexisting methods. The work introduces room-temperature liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s as a reaction environment for the synthesis of oxide nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als with low dimensionality.</p>

Synthetic nacre by predesigned matrix-directed mineralization
<p>Although biomimetic designs are expected to play a key role in exploring future structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, facile fabrication of bulk biomimetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als under ambient conditions remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a mesoscale “assembly-and-mineralization” approach inspired by the natural process in mollusks to fabricate bulk synthetic nacre that highly resembles both the chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion and the hierarchical structure of natural nacre. The millimeter-thick synthetic nacre consists of alternating organic layers and aragonite platelet layers (91 weight percent) and exhibits good ultimate strength and fracture toughness. This predesigned matrix-directed mineralization method represents a rational strategy for the preparation of robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als with hierarchically ordered structures, where various constituents are adaptable, including brittle and heat-labile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als.</p>

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the seed mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole seed. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage formation.</p>

Cold acclimation alters the connective tissue content of the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) heart
<p>Thermal acclimation can alter cardiac function and morphology in a number of fish species, but little is known about the regulation of these changes. The purpose of the present study was to determine how cold acclimation affects zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) cardiac morphology, collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion and connective tissue regulation. Heart volume, the thickness of the compact myocardium, collagen content and collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion were compared between control (27°C) and cold-acclimated (20°C) zebrafish using serially sectioned hearts stained with Picrosirius Red. Collagen content and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion of the pericardial membrane were also examined. Cold acclimation did not affect the volume of the contracted heart; however, there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the compact myocardium. There was also a decrease in the collagen content of the compact myocardium and in the amount of thick collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s throughout the heart. Cold-acclimated zebrafish also increased expression of the gene transcript for matrix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>loproteinase 2, matrix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>loproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>loproteinase 2 and collagen Type I α1. We propose that the reduction in the thickness of the compact myocardium as well as the change in collagen content may help to maintain the compliance of the ventricle as temperatures decrease. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the zebrafish heart undergoes significant remodeling in response to cold acclimation.</p>

Development and Evolution of a Hierarchical Clinical Composite End Point for the Evaluation of Drugs and Devices for Acute and Chronic Heart Failure
<p>Traditional approaches to the assessment of new treatments for heart failure have generally evaluated individual components of the syndrome at fixed points in time or have relied on surrogate physiological measures that are poorly correlated with the clinical status of patients. Conventional time-to-event trials that focus on morbidity and mortality represent an important methodological advance, but they generally assign undue weight to clinical events of less importance and are insensitive to difference in functional capacity among individuals who do not experience a clinical event during follow-up. Twenty years ago, a hierarchical clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>e was developed to address these limitations; it aims to assess the clinical course of patients as a physician would in practice by combining a symptomatic assessment of the patient at each visit with an evaluation of the clinical stability of the patient between visits. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>e does not generate a numeric score by summing arbitrarily assigned weights to certain symptoms or events; instead, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>e ranks relevant measures and outcomes according to clinical priority. In doing so, the clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>e minimizes the biases created by noncompleting patients in the assessment of symptoms or exercise tolerance while expanding the range of patients who contribute to the treatment difference in a typical morbidity and mortality trial. When applied appropriately, the hierarchical clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>e end point has reliably distinguished effective from ineffective treatments. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>e may have particular advantages in the evaluation of new devices and transcatheter interventions in chronic heart failure and of new drugs for acute heart failure. Recent modifications enhance its discriminant characteristics and its ability to accurately assess the efficacy of novel interventions for heart failure.</p>

The most effective piezoelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als are ceramic solid solutions in which the piezoelectric effect is optimized at what are termed morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs).

Insulator-metal transition in dense fluid deuterium
<p>Dense fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic hydrogen occupies the interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and many extrasolar planets, where pressures reach millions of atmospheres. Planetary structure models must describe accurately the transition from the outer molecular envelopes to the interior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic regions. We report optical measurements of dynamically compressed fluid deuterium to 600 gigapascals (GPa) that reveal an increasing refractive index, the onset of absorption of visible light near 150 GPa, and a transition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-like reflectivity (exceeding 30%) near 200 GPa, all at temperatures below 2000 kelvin.

Wallpaper fermions and the nonsymmorphic Dirac insulator

In particular, the two wallpaper groups with multiple glide lines, <i>pgg</i> and <i>p</i>4<i>g</i>, allow for a topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ating phase whose surface spectrum consists of only a single, fourfold-degenerate, true Dirac fermion, representing an exception to a symmetry-enhanced fermion-doubling theorem.

Probing the ultimate plasmon confinement limits with a van der Waals heterostructure
<p>The ability to confine light into tiny spatial dimensions is important for applications such as microscopy, sensing, and nanoscale lasers. Although plasmons offer an appealing avenue to confine light, Landau damping in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s imposes a trade-off between optical field confinement and losses. We show that a graphene-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> heterostructure can overcome that trade-off, and demonstrate plasmon confinement down to the ultimate limit of the length scale of one atom. This is achieved through far-field excitation of plasmon modes squeezed into an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride dielectric spacer between graphene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> rods. A theoretical model that takes into account the nonlocal optical response of both graphene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> is used to describe the results. These ultraconfined plasmonic modes, addressed with far-field light excitation, enable a route to new regimes of ultrastrong light-matter interactions.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Theory
<p>Topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ators are phases of matter characterized by topological edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder. These attributes make topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits topological effects in a unique way: the topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator laser. These are lasers whose lasing mode exhibits topologically protected transport without magnetic fields. The underlying topological properties lead to a highly efficient laser, robust to defects and disorder, with single-mode lasing even at very high gain values. The topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator laser alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and at the same time opens exciting possibilities in topological physics, such as topologically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator laser provides a route to arrays of semiconductor lasers that operate as one single-mode high-power laser coupled efficiently into an output port.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic hydrogen has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic hydrogen may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, hydrogen becomes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the atomic density.

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> accumulation in seeds is a prerequisite for germination and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> transport processes and their interactions in seeds, we focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast transporter of the manganese (Mn) sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clad</span></strong>e of cation diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 transports Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe transport function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe transport. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjecting seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this transporter plays an important role in the generation of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> stores as well as for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

Defining the Diverse Cell Populations Contributing to Lignification in Arabidopsis Stems<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many land plants evolved tall and sturdy growth habits due to specialized cells with thick lignified cell walls: tracheary elements that function in water transport and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s that function in structural support. The objective of this study was to define how and when diverse cell populations contribute lignin precursors, monolignols, to secondary cell walls during lignification of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inflorescence stem. Previous work demonstrated that, when lignin biosynthesis is suppressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> and tracheary element cells with thickened walls, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s become lignin-depleted while vascular bundles still lignify, suggesting that nonlignifying neighboring xylem cells are contributing to lignification. In this work, we dissect the contributions of different cell types, specifically xylary parenchyma and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> cells, to lignification of the stem using cell-type-specific promoters to either knock down an essential monolignol biosynthetic gene or to introduce novel monolignol conjugates. Analysis of either reductions in lignin in knockdown lines, or the addition of novel monolignol conjugates, directly identifies the xylary parenchyma and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> cell populations that contribute to the stem lignification and the developmental timing at which each contribution is most important.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, represents an essential sealing component controlling water and solute movement and protecting seed from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components controlling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator controlling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during seed development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy of electron beam–sensitive crystalline materials
<p>High-resolution imaging of electron beam–sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als is one of the most difficult applications of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The challenges are manifold, including the acquisition of images with extremely low beam doses, the time-constrained search for crystal zone axes, the precise image alignment, and the accurate determination of the defocus value. We develop a suite of methods to fulfill these requirements and acquire atomic-resolution TEM images of several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> organic frameworks that are generally recognized as highly sensitive to electron beams. The high image resolution allows us to identify individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> atomic columns, various types of surface termination, and benzene rings in the organic linkers. We also apply our methods to other electron beam–sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, including the organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>.</p>

Poly[<i>n</i>]catenanes: Synthesis of molecular interlocked chains
<p>As the macromolecular version of mechanically interlocked molecules, mechanically interlocked polymers are promising candidates for the creation of sophisticated molecular machines and smart soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. Poly[<i>n</i>]catenanes, where the molecular chains consist solely of interlocked macrocycles, contain one of the highest concentrations of topological bonds. We report, herein, a synthetic approach toward this distinctive polymer architecture in high yield (~75%) via efficient ring closing of rationally designed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>losupramolecular polymers. Light-scattering, mass spectrometric, and nuclear magnetic resonance characterization of fractionated samples support assignment of the high–molar mass product (number-average molar mass ~21.4 kilograms per mole) to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mixtur</span></strong>e of linear poly[7–26]catenanes, branched poly[13–130]catenanes, and cyclic poly[4–7]catenanes.

Synthesis of ultrasmall, homogeneously alloyed, bimetallic nanoparticles on silica supports
<p>Supported nanoparticles containing more than one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> have a variety of applications in sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine. Common synthesis techniques for this type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al often result in large, unalloyed nanoparticles that lack the interactions between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s that give the particles their desired characteristics. We demonstrate a relatively simple, effective, generalizable method to produce highly dispersed, well-alloyed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bimet</span></strong>allic nanoparticles. Ten permutations of noble and base <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s (platinum, palladium, copper, nickel, and cobalt) were synthesized with average particle sizes from 0.9 to 1.4 nanometers, with tight size distributions. High-resolution imaging and x-ray analysis confirmed the homogeneity of alloying in these ultrasmall nanoparticles.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s that are active catalysts for methane (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–melting temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> alloy catalysts for pyrolysis of methane into hydrogen and carbon. All solid catalysts previously used for this reaction have been deactivated by carbon deposition. In the molten alloy system, the insoluble carbon floats to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi alloy achieved 95% methane conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure hydrogen without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products. Calculations show that the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s in the molten alloys are atomically dispersed and negatively charged. There is a correlation between the amount of charge on the atoms and their catalytic activity.</p>

Titanium isotopic evidence for felsic crust and plate tectonics 3.5 billion years ago
<p>Earth exhibits a dichotomy in elevation and chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion between the continents and ocean floor. Reconstructing when this dichotomy arose is important for understanding when plate tectonics started and how the supply of nutrients to the oceans changed through time. We measured the titanium isotopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion of shales to constrain the chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion of the continental crust exposed to weathering and found that shales of all ages have a uniform isotopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion. This can only be explained if the emerged crust was predominantly felsic (silica-rich) since 3.5 billion years ago, requiring an early initiation of plate tectonics. We also observed a change in the abundance of biologically important nutrients phosphorus and nickel across the Archean-Proterozoic boundary, which might have helped trigger the rise in atmospheric oxygen.</p>

Direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials
<p>Photolithography is an important manufacturing process that relies on using photoresists, typically polymer formulations, that change solubility when illuminated with ultraviolet light. Here, we introduce a general chemical approach for photoresist-free, direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. The patterned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s, semiconductors, oxides, magnetic, or rare earth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ions. No organic impurities are present in the patterned layers, which helps achieve good electronic and optical properties. The conductivity, carrier mobility, dielectric, and luminescence properties of optically patterned layers are on par with the properties of state-of-the-art solution-processed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. The ability to directly pattern all-inorganic layers by using a light exposure dose comparable with that of organic photoresists provides an alternate route for thin-film device manufacturing.</p>

Transformation of bulk alloys to oxide nanowires
<p>One dimensional (1D) nanostructures offer prospects for enhancing the electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties of a broad range of functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>es, but their synthesis methods are typically elaborate and expensive. We demonstrate a direct transformation of bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als into nanowires under ambient conditions without the use of catalysts or any external stimuli. The nanowires form via minimization of strain energy at the boundary of a chemical reaction front. We show the transformation of multimicrometer-sized particles of aluminum or magnesium alloys into alkoxide nanowires of tunable dimensions, which are converted into oxide nanowires upon heating in air. Fabricated separators based on aluminum oxide nanowires enhanced the safety and rate capabilities of lithium-ion batteries. The reported approach allows ultralow-cost scalable synthesis of 1D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als and membranes.</p>

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth’s deep mantle
<p>The redox state of Earth’s convecting mantle, masked by the lithospheric plates and basaltic magmatism of plate tectonics, is a key unknown in the evolutionary history of our planet. Here we report that large, exceptional gem diamonds like the Cullinan, Constellation, and Koh-i-Noor carry direct evidence of crystallization from a redox-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic liquid phase in the deep mantle. These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-carbon-sulfur melt, accompanied by a thin fluid layer of methane ± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former calcium silicate perovskite. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-dominated mineral assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic iron phase that contains dissolved carbon and hydrogen.</p>

Sensitive electromechanical sensors using viscoelastic graphene-polymer nanocomposites
<p>Despite its widespread use in nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>es, the effect of embedding graphene in highly viscoelastic polymer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">matric</span></strong>es is not well understood. We added graphene to a lightly cross-linked polysilicone, often encountered as Silly Putty, changing its electromechanical properties substantially. The resulting nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>es display unusual electromechanical behavior, such as postdeformation temporal relaxation of electrical resistance and nonmonotonic changes in resistivity with strain. These phenomena are associated with the mobility of the nanosheets in the low-viscosity polymer matrix. By considering both the connectivity and mobility of the nanosheets, we developed a quantitative model that completely describes the electromechanical properties. These nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>es are sensitive electromechanical sensors with gauge factors >500 that can measure pulse, blood pressure, and even the impact associated with the footsteps of a small spider.</p>

Infrared Nanospectroscopy Reveals the Chemical Nature of Pit Membranes in Water-Conducting Cells of the Plant Xylem
<p>In the xylem of angiosperm plants, microscopic pits through the secondary cell walls connect the water-conducting vessels. Cellulosic meshes originated from primary walls, and middle lamella between adjacent vessels, called the pit membrane, separates one conduit from another. The intricate structure of the nano-sized pores in pit membranes enables the passage of water under negative pressure without hydraulic failure due to obstruction by gas bubbles (i.e. embolism) under normal conditions or mild drought stress. Since the chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion of pit membranes affects embolism formation and bubble behavior, we directly measured pit membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion in <i>Populus nigra</i> wood. Here, we characterized the chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion of cell wall structures by synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy and atomic force microscopy-infrared nanospectroscopy with high spatial resolution. Characteristic peaks of cellulose, phenolic compounds, and proteins were found in the intervessel pit membranes of <i>P. nigra</i> wood. In addition, the vessel to parenchyma pit membranes and developing cell walls of the vascular cambium showed clear signals of cellulose, proteins, and pectin. We did not find a distinct peak of lignin and other compounds in these structures. Our investigation of the complex chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion of intervessel pit membranes furthers our understanding of the flow of water and bubbles between neighboring conduits. The advances presented here pave the way for further label-free studies related to the nanochemistry of plant cell components.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>s, and their expression requires seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composit</span></strong>ion similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

A Group D MAPK Protects Plants from Autotoxicity by Suppressing Herbivore-Induced Defense Signaling
<p>The mechanisms by which plants activate and enhance defense responses have been well studied; however, the regulatory mechanisms that allow plants to avoid excessive defense responses are poorly understood. Here, we identified a group D mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>OsMAPK20-5</i>, whose expression was rapidly induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation of gravid female adults of a destructive rice pest, brown planthopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>), but not by BPH nymphs. Expression silencing of <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) after gravid female BPH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation, and thereby increased rice plant resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs. However, when exposed to high densities of gravid BPH females, irMAPK plants wilted earlier than wild-type plants, which could be attributed to the hyperaccumulation of ethylene and NO in irMAPK plants. Interestingly, when released into the field, irMAPK plants displayed broad resistance to BPH and white-backed planthopper (<i>Sogatella furcifera</i>), the two most destructive pests of rice, and produced higher yield. Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of rice plants to planthoppers, it also enables rice plants to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense-response–related autotoxicity.</p>

The Structural Integrity of Lignin Is Crucial for Resistance against <i>Striga hermonthica</i> Parasitism in Rice
<p><i>Striga</i> species are parasitic weeds that seriously constrain the productivity of food staples, including cereals and legumes, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In eastern and central Africa, <i>Striga</i> spp. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong> as much as 40 million hectares of smallholder farmland causing total crop failure during severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation. As the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance are yet to be elucidated, we undertook a comparative metabolome study using the <i>Striga</i>-resistant rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivar ‘Nipponbare’ and the susceptible cultivar ‘Koshihikari’. We found that a number of metabolites accumulated preferentially in the <i>Striga</i>-resistant cultivar upon <i>Striga hermonthica</i> infection. Most apparent was increased deposition of lignin, a phenylpropanoid polymer mainly composed of <i>p</i>-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) aromatic units, around the site of interaction in Nipponbare. The increased deposition of lignin was accompanied by induction of the expression of corresponding enzyme-encoding genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway. In addition, perturbing normal lignin composition by knocking down or overexpressing the genes that regulate lignin composition, i.e. <i>p</i>-COUMARATE 3-HYDROXYLASE or FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE, enhanced susceptibility of Nipponbare to <i>S</i>. <i>hermonthica</i> infection. These results demonstrate that enhanced lignin deposition and maintenance of the structural integrity of lignin polymers deposited at the infection site are crucial for postattachment resistance against <i>S</i>. <i>hermonthica</i>.</p>

Loliolide, a Carotenoid Metabolite, Is a Potential Endogenous Inducer of Herbivore Resistance
<p>Jasmonic acid (JA) plays an important role in the induction of herbivore resistance in many plants. However, JA-independent herbivore resistance has been suggested. An herbivore-resistance-inducing substance was isolated from <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-infected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) leaves in which a hypersensitive response (HR) was induced and identified as loliolide, which has been identified as a β-carotene metabolite. When applied to tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves, loliolide decreased the survival rate of the two-spotted spider mite, <i>Tetranychus urticae</i>, egg deposition by the same pest, and the survival rate of larvae of the common cut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong> <i>Spodoptera litura</i> without exhibiting toxicity against these herbivores. Endogenous loliolide levels increased not only with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation by <i>S</i>. <i>litura</i> larvae, but also with the exogenous application of their oral secretions in tomato. A microarray analysis identified cell-wall–associated defense genes as loliolide-responsive tomato genes, and exogenous JA application did not induce the expression of these genes. <i>Suppressor of zeaxanthin</i>-<i>less</i> (<i>szl</i>), an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutant with a point mutation in a key gene of the β-carotene metabolic pathway, exhibited the decreased accumulation of endogenous loliolide and increased susceptibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation by the western flower thrip (<i>Frankliniella occidentalis</i>). A pretreatment with loliolide decreased susceptibility to thrips in the JA-insensitive Arabidopsis mutant <i>coronatine</i>-<i>insensitive1</i>. Exogenous loliolide did not restore reduced electrolyte leakage in <i>szl</i> in response to a HR-inducing bacterial strain. These results suggest that loliolide functions as an endogenous signal that mediates defense responses to herbivores, possibly independently of JA, at least in tomato and Arabidopsis plants.</p>

Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols, and esters, are formed when plant tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct plant defense at wound sites, indirect plant defense via the attraction of herbivore predators, and plant-plant communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for plants to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduction of C6-aldehydes into C6-alcohols is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde reduction remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant plants displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-alcohol production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ed wild-type plants compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> plants, which corresponded with reduced C6-alcohol levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> plants were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered photosystem II activity. Our study shows that reductases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding toxicity from volatile carbonyls and in the attraction of herbivore predators.</p>

Redox Control of Aphid Resistance through Altered Cell Wall Composition and Nutritional Quality
<p>The mechanisms underpinning plant perception of phloem-feeding insects, particularly aphids, remain poorly characterized. Therefore, the role of apoplastic redox state in controlling aphid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation was explored using transgenic tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) plants that have either high (PAO) or low (TAO) ascorbate oxidase (AO) activities relative to the wild type. Only a small number of leaf transcripts and metabolites were changed in response to genotype, and cell wall composition was largely unaffected. Aphid fecundity was decreased significantly in TAO plants compared with other lines. Leaf sugar levels were increased and maximum extractable AO activities were decreased in response to aphids in all genotypes. Transcripts encoding the Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog F, signaling components involved in ethylene and other hormone-mediated pathways, photosynthetic electron transport components, sugar, amino acid, and cell wall metabolism, were increased significantly in the TAO plants in response to aphid perception relative to other lines. The levels of galactosylated xyloglucan were decreased significantly in response to aphid feeding in all the lines, the effect being the least in the TAO plants. Similarly, all lines exhibited increases in tightly bound (1→4)-β-galactan. Taken together, these findings identify AO-dependent mechanisms that limit aphid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation.</p>

An Aphid Effector Targets Trafficking Protein VPS52 in a Host-Specific Manner to Promote Virulence
<p>Plant- and animal-feeding insects secrete saliva inside their hosts, containing effectors, which may promote nutrient release and suppress immunity. Although for plant pathogenic microbes it is well established that effectors target host proteins to modulate host cell processes and promote disease, the host cell targets of herbivorous insects remain elusive. Here, we show that the existing plant pathogenic microbe effector paradigm can be extended to herbivorous insects in that effector-target interactions inside host cells modify critical host processes to promote plant susceptibility. We showed that the effector Mp1 from <i>Myzus persicae</i> associates with the host Vacuolar Protein Sorting Associated Protein52 (VPS52). Using natural variants, we provide a strong link between effector virulence activity and association with VPS52, and show that the association is highly specific to <i>M</i>. <i>persicae</i>-host interactions. Also, coexpression of Mp1, but not Mp1-like variants, specifically with host VPS52s resulted in effector relocalization to vesicle-like structures that associate with prevacuolar compartments. We show that high VPS52 levels negatively impact virulence, and that aphids are able to reduce VPS52 levels during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation, indicating that VPS52 is an important virulence target. Our work is an important step forward in understanding, at the molecular level, how a major agricultural pest promotes susceptibility during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation of crop plants. We give evidence that an herbivorous insect employs effectors that interact with host proteins as part of an effective virulence strategy, and that these effectors likely function in a species-specific manner.</p>

Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>
<p>The structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale have been well studied in animals with rigid skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in animals with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of mechanically important morphological features of the earth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong> <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> over an ontogenetic size range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that <i>L. terrestris</i> becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with size means that, when normalized for mass, adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong>s gain ~117% mechanical advantage during radial expansion, compared with hatchling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong>s. We also found that the cross-sectional area of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 power across segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 power predicted by isometry. The cross-sectional area of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 power across segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage, we calculate that the force output generated during both circular and longitudinal muscle contraction scales near isometry. We hypothesize that the allometric scaling of earth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong>s may reflect changes in soil properties and burrowing mechanics with size.</p>

Dual phosphorylation of Ric-8A enhances its ability to mediate G protein α subunit folding and to stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange
<p>Resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase-8A (Ric-8A) and Ric-8B are essential biosynthetic chaperones for heterotrimeric G protein α subunits. We provide evidence for the direct regulation of Ric-8A cellular activity by dual phosphorylation. Using proteomics, Western blotting, and mutational analyses, we determined that Ric-8A was constitutively phosphorylated at five serines and threonines by the protein kinase CK2. Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>435</sup> and Thr<sup>440</sup> in rat Ric-8A (corresponding to Ser<sup>436</sup> and Thr<sup>441</sup> in human Ric-8A) was required for high-affinity binding to Gα subunits, efficient stimulation of Gα subunit guanine nucleotide exchange, and mediation of Gα subunit folding. The CK2 consensus sites that contain Ser<sup>435</sup> and Thr<sup>440</sup> are conserved in Ric-8 homologs from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong>s to mammals. We found that the homologous residues in mouse Ric-8B, Ser<sup>468</sup> and Ser<sup>473</sup>, were also phosphorylated. Mutation of the genomic copy of <i>ric-8</i> in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to encode alanine in the homologous sites resulted in characteristic <i>ric-8</i> reduction-of-function phenotypes that are associated with defective G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>s</sub> signaling, including reduced locomotion and defective egg laying. The <i>C. elegans ric-8</i> phosphorylation site mutant phenotypes were partially rescued by chemical stimulation of G<sub>q</sub> signaling. These results indicate that dual phosphorylation represents a critical form of conserved Ric-8 regulation and demonstrate that Ric-8 proteins are needed for effective Gα signaling. The position of the CK2-phosphorylated sites within a structural model of Ric-8A reveals that these sites contribute to a key acidic and negatively charged surface that may be important for its interactions with Gα subunits.</p>

Crystal-clear treatment for allergic disease

On page 751 of this issue, Persson <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) confirm anecdotal evidence that CLCs are a key feature of severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

Acoel genome reveals the regulatory landscape of whole-body regeneration
<p>Whole-body regeneration is accompanied by complex transcriptomic changes, yet the chromatin regulatory landscapes that mediate this dynamic response remain unexplored.

Epigenomic profiling revealed thousands of regeneration-responsive chromatin regions and identified dynamically bound transcription factor motifs, with the early growth response (EGR) binding site as the most variably accessible during <i>Hofstenia</i> regeneration. Combining <i>egr</i> inhibition with chromatin profiling suggests that Egr functions as a pioneer factor to directly regulate early wound-induced genes. The genetic connections inferred by this approach allowed the construction of a gene regulatory network for whole-body regeneration, enabling genomics-based comparisons of regeneration across species.</p>

Hybridization may give some parasites a leg up
<p>Infecting an estimated 230 million people, schistosomiasis is the world's most widespread parasitic disease after malaria. But temperate latitudes were thought to be spared, until researchers documented an outbreak on the French island of Corsica in 2014.

The river is still <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ed: At least 120 people have become infected. And the disease is turning up elsewhere on Corsica. The culprit is no ordinary schistosome parasite, but a hybrid of two separate species that appears to be better than both parent species at infecting both the snails and its unfortunate mammalian hosts. Such hybrids, discovered in other parasitic species as well, could widen a parasite's range of host mammals, complicating efforts to control it.</p>

If two deletions don't stop growth, try three
<p>How many and which genes does an organism need at a minimum to sustain growth? With the identification of essential genes in a variety of organisms such as yeast (<i>1</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong>s (<i>2</i>), and human cultured cells (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>), the answer may seem obvious: Remove all nonessential genes, and the organism should be able to continue to survive and grow. In the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the workhorse of genetic interaction mapping, ∼1000 of the ∼6000 (∼17%) protein-coding genes are essential for viability (<i>1</i>). So theoretically, one might think that one could remove the other ∼5000 nonessential genes and still have a growing yeast. The reason this does not work is that genes interact with each other to drive different traits, including viability and growth. On page 283 of this issue, Kuzmin <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) provide the first systematic analysis of trigenic interactions in yeast in which three gene deletions are combined in individual strains in order to ascertain the importance of multigene interactions for growth. This study shows that higher-order genetic interactions are abundant, which has implications for the interpretation of human gene variants that may interact to affect health and disease.</p>

We integrated these profiles with whole-animal chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data to deconvolve the cell type–specific effects of transcription factors.

Heterochronic Genes Turn Back the Clock in Old Neurons
<p>Although some neuron types regenerate better than others, all neurons lose the ability to regenerate with age. This intrinsic decline is the primary cause of regeneration failure even in permissive environments. This was shown in 1995 by comparing the regeneration ability of retinal neurons from different aged retinas growing into tectums of different ages (<i>1</i>). Embryonic retinal axons regrew into tectum of any age, including older tectum with an inhibitory glial environment, whereas postnatal day 2 or older retinal axons failed to regrow even into embryonic tectum. This indicated a “programmed” loss of axon regeneration ability with neuron age. Similarly, young hindbrain neurons transplanted into older spinal cords could regenerate axons into a normally inhibitory myelinated environment (<i>2</i>). Despite the clear therapeutic implications of these observations, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling age-dependent regenerative capacity were unclear. On page 372 in this issue, Zou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that the highly conserved <i>let-7</i>–LIN-41 heterochronic signaling pathway is responsible for part of the age-related decline in axon regeneration in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong> <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.</p>

12-Oxo-Phytodienoic Acid Acts as a Regulator of Maize Defense against Corn Leaf Aphid
<p>The corn leaf aphid (CLA; <i>Rhopalosiphum maidis</i>) is a phloem sap-sucking insect that attacks many cereal crops, including maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We previously showed that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical plant breeding, provides enhanced resistance to CLA. Here, using electrophysiological monitoring of aphid feeding behavior, we demonstrate that Mp708 provides phloem-mediated resistance to CLA. Furthermore, feeding by CLA on Mp708 plants enhanced callose deposition, a potential defense mechanism utilized by plants to limit aphid feeding and subsequent colonization. In maize, benzoxazinoids (BX) or BX-derived metabolites contribute to enhanced callose deposition by providing heightened resistance to CLA. However, BX and BX-derived metabolites were not significantly altered in CLA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ed Mp708 plants, indicating BX-independent defense against CLA. Evidence presented here suggests that the constitutively higher levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) in Mp708 plants contributed to enhanced callose accumulation and heightened CLA resistance. OPDA enhanced the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and receptor genes, and the synergistic interactions of OPDA and CLA feeding significantly induced the expression of the transcripts encoding Maize insect resistance1-Cysteine Protease, a key defensive protein against insect pests, in Mp708 plants. Furthermore, exogenous application of OPDA on maize jasmonic acid-deficient plants caused enhanced callose accumulation and heightened resistance to CLA, suggesting that the OPDA-mediated resistance to CLA is independent of the jasmonic acid pathway. We further demonstrate that the signaling function of OPDA, rather than a direct toxic effect, contributes to enhanced CLA resistance in Mp708.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>ACTIN-DEPOLYMERIZING FACTOR3</i> Is Required for Controlling Aphid Feeding from the Phloem
<p>The actin cytoskeleton network has an important role in plant cell growth, division, and stress response. Actin-depolymerizing factors (ADFs) are a group of actin-binding proteins that contribute to reorganization of the actin network. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>ADF3</i> is required in the phloem for controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation by <i>Myzus persicae</i> Sulzer, commonly known as the green peach aphid (GPA), which is an important phloem sap-consuming pest of more than fifty plant families. In agreement with a role for the actin-depolymerizing function of ADF3 in defense against the GPA, we show that resistance in <i>adf3</i> was restored by overexpression of the related ADF4 and the actin cytoskeleton destabilizers, cytochalasin D and latrunculin B. Electrical monitoring of the GPA feeding behavior indicates that the GPA stylets found sieve elements faster when feeding on the <i>adf3</i> mutant compared to the wild-type plant. In addition, once they found the sieve elements, the GPA fed for a more prolonged period from sieve elements of <i>adf3</i> compared to the wild-type plant. The longer feeding period correlated with an increase in fecundity and population size of the GPA and a parallel reduction in callose deposition in the <i>adf3</i> mutant. The <i>adf3</i>-conferred susceptibility to GPA was overcome by expression of the <i>ADF3</i> coding sequence from the phloem-specific <i>SUC2</i> promoter, thus confirming the importance of <i>ADF3</i> function in the phloem. We further demonstrate that the <i>ADF3</i>-dependent defense mechanism is linked to the transcriptional up-regulation of <i>PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT4</i>, which is an important regulator of defenses against the GPA.</p>

Resolvase OsGEN1 Mediates DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Yen1/GEN1 are canonical Holliday junction resolvases that belong to the RAD2/XPG family. In eukaryotes, such as budding yeast, mice, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong>s, and humans, Yen1/GEN1 work together with Mus81-Mms4/MUS81-EME1 and Slx1-Slx4/SLX1-SLX4 in DNA repair by homologous recombination to maintain genome stability. In plants, the biological function of Yen1/GEN1 remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized the loss of function mutants of <i>OsGEN1</i> and <i>OsSEND1</i>, a pair of paralogs of Yen1/GEN1 in rice (<i>Oryza</i> <i>sativa</i>). We first investigated the role of <i>OsGEN1</i> during meiosis and found a reduction in chiasma frequency by ∼6% in <i>osgen1</i> mutants, compared to the wild type, suggesting a possible involvement of OsGEN1 in the formation of crossovers. Postmeiosis, OsGEN1 foci were detected in wild-type microspore nuclei, but not in the <i>osgen1</i> mutant concomitant with an increase in double-strand breaks. Persistent double-strand breaks led to programmed cell death of the male gametes and complete male sterility. In contrast, depletion of <i>OsSEND1</i> had no effects on plant development and did not enhance <i>osgen1</i> defects. Our results indicate that OsGEN1 is essential for homologous recombinational DNA repair at two stages of microsporogenesis in rice.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propuls</span></strong>ion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propuls</span></strong>ion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle contraction increases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propuls</span></strong>ive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

Swimming with multiple propulsors: measurement and comparison of swimming gaits in three species of neotropical cichlids
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Differently shaped fish species use varying combinations of body–caudal fin and pectoral fin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propuls</span></strong>ion at different speeds. Gait is characterized as a trajectory through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propuls</span></strong>ive parameter space for analysis and comparison.</p>

Take-off mechanisms in parasitoid wasps
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Parasitoid wasps use three strategies to take off: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propuls</span></strong>ion by rapid leg movements, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propuls</span></strong>ion by flapping wing movements and a combination of the two. Leg movements provide the most energy-efficient mechanism.</p>

A continental system for forecasting bird migration
<p>Billions of animals cross the globe each year during seasonal migrations, but efforts to monitor them are hampered by the unpredictability of their movements. We developed a bird migration forecast system at a continental scale by leveraging 23 years of spring observations to identify associations between atmospheric conditions and bird migration intensity. Our models explained up to 81% of variation in migration intensity across the United States at altitudes of 0 to 3000 meters, and performance remained high in forecasting events 1 to 7 days in advance (62 to 76% of variation was explained). Avian migratory movements across the United States likely exceed 500 million individuals per night during peak passage. Bird migration forecasts will reduce collisions with buildings, airplanes, and wind <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">turbin</span></strong>es; inform a variety of monitoring efforts; and engage the public.</p>

Mechanisms for the functional differentiation of the propulsive and braking roles of the forelimbs and hindlimbs during quadrupedal walking in primates and felines
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Theoretical models and empirical results reveal that functional differentiation of the limbs of quadrupeds in terms of net braking and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propuls</span></strong>ive roles is driven, in part, by the relative position of the limb point of contact relative to the center of mass.</p>

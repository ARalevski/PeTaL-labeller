Lifetime of the solar nebula constrained by meteorite paleomagnetism
<p>A key stage in planet formation is the evolution of a gaseous and magnetized solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong>. However, the lifetime of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong>r magnetic field and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong> are poorly constrained. We present paleomagnetic analyses of volcanic angrites demonstrating that they formed in a near-zero magnetic field (<0.6 microtesla) at 4563.5 Â± 0.1 million years ago, ~3.8 million years after solar system formation. This indicates that the solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong> field, and likely the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong>r gas, had dispersed by this time. This sets the time scale for formation of the gas giants and planet migration. Furthermore, it supports formation of chondrules after 4563.5 million years ago by non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong>r processes like planetesimal collisions. The core dynamo on the angrite parent body did not initiate until about 4 to 11 million years after solar system formation.</p>

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>, who had pre-operative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively   compared with those with full thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial thickness   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness   cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients   with partial thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> achieve a good result we cannot currently   identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful   and misleading.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:475–82.</p></sec>

Long-Term Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Women Who Have Had Infants With Heart Defects
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The possibility that congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s signal a familial predisposition to cardiovascular disease has not been investigated. We aimed to determine whether the risk of cardiovascular disorders later in life was higher for women who have had newborns with congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied a cohort of 1 084 251 women who had delivered infants between 1989 and 2013 in Quebec, Canada. We identified women whose infants had critical, noncritical, or no heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, and tracked the women over time for future hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease, with follow-up extending up to 25 years past pregnancy. We calculated the incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization per 1000 person-years, and used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between infant heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s and risk of maternal cardiovascular hospitalization. Models were adjusted for age, parity, preeclampsia, comorbidity, material deprivation, and time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Women whose infants had heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s had a higher overall incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization. There were 3.38 cardiovascular hospitalizations per 1000 person-years for those with critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s (95% CI, 2.67–4.27), 3.19 for noncritical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s (95% CI, 2.96–3.45), and 2.42 for no heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s (95% CI, 2.39–2.44). In comparison with no heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, women whose infants had critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s had a hazard ratio of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.13–1.82) for any cardiovascular hospitalization, and women whose infants had noncritical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s had a hazard ratio of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.15–1.34), in adjusted models. Risks of specific causes of cardiovascular hospitalization, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, and other atherosclerotic disorders, were also greater for mothers of infants with congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s than with no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Women whose infants have congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s have a greater risk of cardiovascular hospitalization later in life. Congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in offspring may be an early marker of predisposition to cardiovascular disease.</p></sec>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

Exercise Intolerance in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common syndrome with a pressing shortage of therapies. Exercise intolerance is a cardinal symptom of HFpEF, yet its pathophysiology remains uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the mechanism of exercise intolerance in 134 patients referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing: 79 with HFpEF and 55 controls. We performed cardiopulmonary exercise testing with invasive monitoring to measure hemodynamics, blood gases, and gas exchange during exercise. We used these measurements to quantify 6 steps of oxygen transport and utilization (the O<sub>2</sub> pathway) in each patient with HFpEF, identifying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive steps that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong> each one’s exercise capacity (peak Vo<sub>2</sub>). We then quantified the functional significance of each O<sub>2</sub> pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> by calculating the improvement in exercise capacity a patient could expect from correcting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Peak Vo<sub>2</sub> was reduced by 34±2% (mean±SEM, <i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF compared with controls of similar age, sex, and body mass index. The vast majority (97%) of patients with HFpEF harbored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s at multiple steps of the O<sub>2</sub> pathway, the identity and magnitude of which varied widely. Two of these steps, cardiac output and skeletal muscle O<sub>2</sub> diffusion, were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed relative to controls by an average of 27±3% and 36±2%, respectively (<i>P</i><0.001 for both). Due to interactions between a given patient’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, the predicted benefit of correcting any single one was often minor; on average, correcting a patient’s cardiac output led to a 7±0.5% predicted improvement in exercise intolerance, whereas correcting a patient’s muscle diffusion capacity led to a 27±1% improvement. At the individual level, the impact of any given O<sub>2</sub> pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> on a patient’s exercise capacity was strongly influenced by comorbid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Systematic analysis of the O<sub>2</sub> pathway in HFpEF showed that exercise capacity was undermined by multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, including reductions in cardiac output and skeletal muscle diffusion capacity. An important source of disease heterogeneity stemmed from variation in each patient’s personal profile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s. Personalized O<sub>2</sub> pathway analysis could identify patients most likely to benefit from treating a specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>; however, the system properties of O<sub>2</sub> transport favor treating multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s at once, as with exercise training.</p></sec>

Association Between Fetal Congenital Heart Defects and Maternal Risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in the Same Pregnancy and Across Pregnancies
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both pregnant women carrying fetuses with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s and women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy often exhibit angiogenic imbalances, suggesting that the same mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of the former and the pathophysiology of the latter. We conducted a register-based cohort study to determine whether offspring congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s are associated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and whether the mechanisms driving any association are primarily maternal or fetal.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among singleton pregnancies without chromosomal abnormalities lasting ≥20 weeks in Denmark from 1978 to 2011 (n= 1 972 857), we identified pregnancies complicated by offspring congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s or early preterm preeclampsia, late preterm preeclampsia, term preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension. We used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for associations between offspring congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s and maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy overall and for specific heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Offspring congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s were strongly associated with early preterm preeclampsia (OR, 7.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.11–8.03) and late preterm preeclampsia (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.38–3.34) in the same pregnancy and weakly associated with term preeclampsia (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06–1.27), but they were not associated with gestational hypertension (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25). Association strengths were consistent across heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> types. Offspring congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in a previous pregnancy were also strongly associated with preterm preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies (early preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.68–3.34; late preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.52–2.75) but were only modestly associated with term preeclampsia and not associated with gestational hypertension. Similarly, preterm preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, but not term preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, was associated with offspring congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in later pregnancies (early preterm preeclampsia: OR, 7.91; 95% CI, 6.06–10.3; late preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.11–3.79; term preeclampsia: OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88–1.10; gestational hypertension: OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92–1.38).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Linked pathophysiological mechanisms may be involved in some congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s and preterm preeclampsia.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Non-Mendelian Green Cotyledon Gene in Soybean Encodes a Small Subunit of Photosystem II
<p>Chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation plays important roles in leaf senescence including regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of chlorophyll-binding proteins. Although most genes encoding enzymes of the chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation pathway have been identified, the regulation of their activity has not been fully understood. Green cotyledon mutants in legume are stay-green mutants, in which chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Among them, the soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) green cotyledon gene <i>cytG</i> is unique because it is maternally inherited. To isolate <i>cytG</i>, we extensively sequenced the soybean chloroplast genome, and detected a 5-bp insertion causing a frame-shift in <i>psbM</i>, which encodes one of the small subunits of photosystem II. Mutant tobacco plants (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) with a disrupted <i>psbM</i> generated using a chloroplast transformation technique had green senescent leaves, confirming that <i>cytG</i> encodes PsbM. The phenotype of <i>cytG</i> was very similar to that of mutant of chlorophyll <i>b</i> reductase catalyzing the first step of chlorophyll <i>b</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. In fact, chlorophyll <i>b</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ing activity in dark-grown <i>cytG</i> and <i>psbM</i>-knockout seedlings was significantly lower than that of wild-type plants. Our results suggest that PsbM is a unique protein linking photosynthesis in presenescent leaves with chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Additionally, we discuss the origin of <i>cytG</i>, which may have been selected during domestication of soybean.</p>

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation, or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ity   correction in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation at a mean of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for fractures of the navicular that gives associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es   involving the lateral column due consideration.

Hemiarthroplasty proximal femoral endoprostheses following tumour reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Dislocation rates are reportedly lower in patients requiring   proximal femoral hemiarthroplasty than for patients undergoing hip   arthroplasty for neoplasia. Without acetabular replacement, pain   due to acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> necessitating revision surgery has been described.   We aimed to determine whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> of the native acetabulum following   hemiarthroplasty necessitates revision surgery with secondary replacement   of the acetabulum after proximal femoral replacement (PFR) for tumour   reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 100 consecutive PFRs performed between January 2003   and January 2013 without acetabular resurfacing. The procedure was   undertaken in 74 patients with metastases, for a primary bone tumour   in 20 and for myeloma in six. There were 48 male and 52 female patients,   with a mean age of 61.4 years (19 to 85) and median follow-up of   two years (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5 to 3.7 years). In total,   52 patients presented with a pathological fracture and six presented   with failed fixation of a previously instrumented pathological fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All patients underwent reconstruction with either a unipolar   (n = 64) or bipolar (n = 36) articulation. There were no dislocations   and no acetabular resurfacings. Articular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> was graded using   the criteria of Baker et al from 0 to 3, where by 0 is normal; grade   1 represents a narrowing of articular cartilage and no bone erosion;   grade 2 represents acetabular bone erosion and early migration;   and grade 3 represents protrusio acetabuli.

Opposing Actions of Fibroblast and Cardiomyocyte Smad3 Signaling in the Infarcted Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transforming growth factor–βs regulate a wide range of cellular responses by activating Smad-dependent and Smad-independent cascades. In the infarcted heart, Smad3 signaling is activated in both cardiomyocytes and interstitial cells. We hypothesized that cell-specific actions of Smad3 regulate repair and remodeling in the infarcted myocardium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To dissect cell-specific Smad3 actions in myocardial infarction, we generated mice with Smad3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> in activated fibroblasts or cardiomyocytes. Cardiac function was assessed after reperfused or nonreperfused infarction using echocardiography. The effects of cell-specific Smad3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> on the infarcted heart were studied using histological studies, assessment of protein, and gene expression levels. In vitro, we studied Smad-dependent and Smad-independent actions in isolated cardiac fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mice with fibroblast-specific Smad3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> had accentuated adverse remodeling after reperfused infarction and exhibited an increased incidence of late rupture after nonreperfused infarction. The consequences of fibroblast-specific Smad3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> were not a result of effects on acute infarct size but were associated with unrestrained fibroblast proliferation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed scar remodeling, reduced fibroblast-derived collagen synthesis, and perturbed alignment of myofibroblast arrays in the infarct. Polarized light microscopy in Sirius red–stained sections demonstrated that the changes in fibroblast morphology were associated with perturbed organization of the collagenous matrix in the infarcted area. In contrast, α-smooth muscle actin expression by infarct myofibroblasts was not affected by Smad3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>. Smad3 critically regulated fibroblast function, activating integrin-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase–2 (NOX-2) expression. Smad3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> in cardiomyocytes attenuated remodeling and dysfunction after infarction. Cardiomyocyte-specific Smad3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> did not affect acute infarct size but was associated with attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the remodeling myocardium, accompanied by decreased myocardial NOX-2 levels, reduced nitrosative stress, and lower matrix metalloproteinase–2 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In healing myocardial infarction, myofibroblast- and cardiomyocyte-specific activation of Smad3 has contrasting functional outcomes that may involve activation of an integrin/reactive oxygen axis.</p></sec>

Mean RV EF was 40.4±10.2%, ranging from 10% to 65%. RV EF was severely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed (≤35%) in 63 patients (30%), and biventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment (left ventricular EF<60% and RV EF≤35%) was found in 34 patients (16%). Pathophysiologic correlates of RV EF were left ventricular septal function (β=0.42, <i>P</i><0.0001), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter index (β=−0.22, <i>P</i>=0.002), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (β=−0.14, <i>P</i>=0.047).

Pin1 mediates Aβ<sub>42</sub>-induced dendritic spine loss
<p>Early-stage Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of dendritic spines in the neocortex of the brain. This phenomenon precedes tau pathology, plaque formation, and neurodegeneration and likely contributes to synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>, memory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment, and behavioral changes in patients. Studies suggest that dendritic spine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> is induced by soluble, multimeric amyloid-β (Aβ<sub>42</sub>), which, through postsynaptic signaling, activates the protein phosphatase calcineurin. We investigated how calcineurin caused spine pathology and found that the cis-trans prolyl isomerase Pin1 was a critical downstream target of Aβ<sub>42</sub>-calcineurin signaling. In dendritic spines, Pin1 interacted with and was dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which rapidly suppressed its isomerase activity. Knockout of Pin1 or exposure to Aβ<sub>42</sub> induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of mature dendritic spines, which was prevented by exogenous Pin1. The calcineurin inhibitor FK506 blocked dendritic spine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> in Aβ<sub>42</sub>-treated wild-type cells but had no effect on <i>Pin1</i>-null neurons. These data implicate Pin1 in dendritic spine maintenance and synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> in early Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

Temperature-activated ion channels in neural crest cells confer maternal fever–associated birth defects
<p>Birth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s of the heart and face are common, and most have no known genetic cause, suggesting a role for environmental factors. Maternal fever during the first trimester is an environmental risk factor linked to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s. Neural crest cells are precursor populations essential to the development of both at-risk tissues. We report that two heat-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, TRPV1 and TRPV4, were present in neural crest cells during critical windows of heart and face development. TRPV1 antagonists protected against the development of hyperthermia-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in chick embryos. Treatment with chemical agonists of TRPV1 or TRPV4 replicated hyperthermia-induced birth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in chick and zebrafish embryos. To test whether transient TRPV channel permeability in neural crest cells was sufficient to induce these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, we engineered iron-binding modifications to TRPV1 and TRPV4 that enabled remote and noninvasive activation of these channels in specific cellular locations and at specific developmental times in chick embryos with radio-frequency electromagnetic fields. Transient stimulation of radio frequency–controlled TRP channels in neural crest cells replicated fever-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in developing chick embryos. Our data provide a previously undescribed mechanism for congenital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, whereby hyperthermia activates ion channels that negatively affect fetal development.</p>

N-terminal degradation activates the NLRP1B inflammasome
<p>Intracellular pathogens and danger signals trigger the formation of inflammasomes, which activate inflammatory caspases and induce pyroptosis. The anthrax <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lethal</span></strong> factor metalloprotease and small-molecule DPP8/9 inhibitors both activate the NLRP1B inflammasome, but the molecular mechanism of NLRP1B activation is unknown. In this study, we used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens to identify genes required for NLRP1B-mediated pyroptosis. We discovered that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lethal</span></strong> factor induces cell death via the N-end rule proteasomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation pathway. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lethal</span></strong> factor directly cleaves NLRP1B, inducing the N-end rule–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the NLRP1B N terminus and freeing the NLRP1B C terminus to activate caspase-1. DPP8/9 inhibitors also induce proteasomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the NLRP1B N terminus but not via the N-end rule pathway. Thus, N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation is the common activation mechanism of this innate immune sensor.</p>

Extraordinary plasticity of an inorganic semiconductor in darkness
<p>Inorganic semiconductors generally tend to fail in a brittle manner. Here, we report that extraordinary “plasticity” can take place in an inorganic semiconductor if the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation is carried out “in complete darkness.” Room-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation tests of zinc sulfide (ZnS) were performed under varying light conditions. ZnS crystals immediately fractured when they <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed under light irradiation. In contrast, it was found that ZnS crystals can be plastically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed up to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation strain of ε<sub>t</sub> = 45% in complete darkness. In addition, the optical bandgap of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed ZnS crystals was distinctly decreased after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation. These results suggest that dislocations in ZnS become mobile in complete darkness and that multiplied dislocations can affect the optical bandgap over the whole crystal. Inorganic semiconductors are not necessarily intrinsically brittle.</p>

MONENSIN SENSITIVITY1 (MON1)/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-Mediated Rab7 Activation Regulates Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD)-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of plant tapetum is essential for microspore development and pollen coat formation; however, little is known about the cellular mechanism regulating tapetal PCD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab7-mediated vacuolar transport of tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation-related cysteine proteases is crucial for tapetal PCD and pollen development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with the following evidence: (1) The <i>monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>mon1</i>) mutants, which are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive in Rab7 activation, showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed male fertility due to a combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in both tapetum and male gametophyte development. (2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and pollen. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal pollen coat formation and decreased male fertility. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-mediated Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-mediated vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive pollen germination and tube growth. Taken together, tapetal PCD and pollen development require successful MON1/CCZ1-mediated vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral suppressors of RNA silencing induce developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s similar to those caused by mutations in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral suppressor-mediated developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral suppressors were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> mutation. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral suppressor-mediated developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, using two independent <i>arf8</i> mutations and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral suppressor of silencing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F1 generation, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the phenotype in the F2 generation. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of phenotype in the F2 generation was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>-of-function point mutation, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 generations. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

Here, we show that ADAMTS-A, the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of human ADAMTS 9 and ADAMTS 20, and of <i>C. elegans</i> GON-1, is required for cell migration during embryogenesis. <i>AdamTS-A</i> is expressed in multiple migratory cell types, including hemocytes, caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM), the visceral branch of the trachea (VBs) and the secretory portion of the salivary gland (SG). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of <i>AdamTS-A</i> causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in germ cell, CVM and VB migration and, depending on the tissue, <i>AdamTS-A</i> functions both autonomously and non-autonomously. In the highly polarized collective of the SG epithelium, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of <i>AdamTS-A</i> causes apical surface irregularities and cell elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s. We provide evidence that ADAMTS-A is secreted into the SG lumen where it functions to release cells from the apical ECM, consistent with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s observed in <i>AdamTS-A</i> mutant SGs. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of the apically localized protocadherin <i>Cad99C</i> rescues the SG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, suggesting that Cad99C serves as a link between the SG apical membrane and the secreted apical ECM component(s) cleaved by ADAMTS-A. Our analysis of <i>AdamTS-A</i> function in the SG suggests a novel role for ADAMTS proteins in detaching cells from the apical ECM, facilitating tube elongation during collective cell migration.</p>

Application of Large-Scale Aptamer-Based Proteomic Profiling to Planned Myocardial Infarctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Emerging proteomic technologies using novel affinity-based reagents allow for efficient multiplexing with high-sample throughput. To identify early biomarkers of myocardial injury, we recently applied an aptamer-based proteomic profiling platform that measures 1129 proteins to samples from patients undergoing septal alcohol ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a human model of planned myocardial injury. Here, we examined the scalability of this approach using a markedly expanded platform to study a far broader range of human proteins in the context of myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a highly multiplexed, expanded proteomic technique that uses single-stranded DNA aptamers to assay 4783 human proteins (4137 distinct human gene targets) to derivation and validation cohorts of planned myocardial injury, individuals with spontaneous myocardial infarction, and at-risk controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found 376 target proteins that significantly changed in the blood after planned myocardial injury in a derivation cohort (n=20; <i>P</i><1.05E-05, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance, Bonferroni threshold). Two hundred forty-seven of these proteins were validated in an independent planned myocardial injury cohort (n=15; <i>P</i><1.33E-04, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance); >90% were directionally consistent and reached nominal significance in the validation cohort. Among the validated proteins that were increased within 1 hour after planned myocardial injury, 29 were also elevated in patients with spontaneous myocardial infarction (n=63; <i>P</i><6.17E-04). Many of the novel markers identified in our study are intracellular proteins not previously identified in the peripheral circulation or have functional roles relevant to myocardial injury. For example, the cardiac LIM protein, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 3, is thought to mediate cardiac mechanotransduction and stress responses, whereas the mitochondrial ATP synthase F<sub>0</sub> subunit component is a vasoactive peptide on its release from cells. Last, we performed aptamer-affinity enrichment coupled with mass spectrometry to technically verify aptamer specificity for a subset of the new biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale aptamer multiplexing at a level that has not previously been reported and with sample throughput that greatly exceeds other existing proteomic methods. The expanded aptamer-based proteomic platform provides a unique opportunity for biomarker and pathway discovery after myocardial injury.</p></sec>

Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction and Myocardial Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are common in clinical practice, but long-term consequences are uncertain. We aimed to define long-term outcomes and explore risk stratification in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified consecutive patients (n=2122) with elevated cardiac troponin I concentrations (≥0.05 µg/L) at a tertiary cardiac center. All diagnoses were adjudicated as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) and noncardiovascular death. To explore competing risks, cause-specific hazard ratios were obtained using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The adjudicated index diagnosis was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively. At 5 years, all-cause death rates were higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (62.5%) or myocardial injury (72.4%) compared with type 1 myocardial infarction (36.7%). The majority of excess deaths in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were because of noncardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.92–2.81 versus type 1 myocardial infarction). Despite this finding, the observed crude major adverse cardiovascular event rates were similar between groups (30.6% versus 32.6%), with differences apparent after adjustment for covariates (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.96). Coronary heart disease was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.24).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite an excess in noncardiovascular death, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury have a similar crude rate of major adverse cardiovascular events as those with type 1 myocardial infarction. Identifying underlying coronary heart disease in this vulnerable population may help target therapies that could modify future risk.</p></sec>

A Eu<sup>3+</sup>-Eu<sup>2+</sup> ion redox shuttle imparts operational durability to Pb-I perovskite solar cells
<p>The components with soft nature in the metal halide perovskite absorber usually generate lead (Pb)<sup>0</sup> and iodine (I)<sup>0</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s during device fabrication and operation. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s serve as not only recombination centers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ate device efficiency but also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation initiators to hamper device lifetimes.

The resultant device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.52% (certified 20.52%) with substantially improved long-term durability. The devices retained 92% and 89% of the peak PCE under 1-sun continuous illumination or heating at 85°C for 1500 hours and 91% of the original stable PCE after maximum power point tracking for 500 hours, respectively.</p>

Ancient convergent losses of <i>Paraoxonase 1</i> yield potential risks for modern marine mammals
<p>Mammals diversified by colonizing drastically different environments, with each transition yielding numerous molecular changes, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>es of protein function. Though not initially deleterious, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>es could subsequently carry deleterious pleiotropic consequences. We have used phylogenetic methods to identify convergent functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>es across independent marine mammal lineages. In one extreme case, <i>Paraoxonase 1</i> (<i>PON1</i>) accrued lesions in all marine lineages, while remaining intact in all terrestrial mammals. These lesions coincide with PON1 enzymatic activity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> in marine species’ blood plasma. This convergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> is likely explained by parallel shifts in marine ancestors’ lipid metabolism and/or bloodstream oxidative environment affecting PON1’s role in fatty acid oxidation. PON1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> also eliminates marine mammals’ main defense against neurotoxicity from specific man-made organophosphorus compounds, implying potential risks in modern environments.</p>

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate immunity, a large part of which consists of one type of immune cell—the neutrophil. Neutrophils form the largest group of immune cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> neutrophils daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of toxic chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lethal</span></strong> influenza-associated lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">destruct</span></strong>ion (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another neutrophil defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying neutrophils mix their nuclear DNA with toxic components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in the surrounding environment. This process is called NETosis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying genetic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>ization on NETs, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cytotoxic molecules on the NET-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming immune complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of NETs has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>e freshly formed NETs. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lethal</span></strong> immunopathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>VAC14</i> Is Critical for Pollen Development through Mediating Vacuolar Organization
<p>Pollen viability depends on dynamic vacuolar changes during pollen development involving increases and decreases of vacuolar volume through water and osmolite accumulation and vacuolar fission. Mutations in <i>FAB1A</i> to <i>FAB1D</i>, the genes encoding phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>]-converting kinases, are male gametophyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lethal</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I, suggesting a key role of the phospholipid in dynamic vacuolar organization. However, other genetic components that regulate the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and its involvement in pollen germination and tube growth are unknown. Here, we identified and characterized Arabidopsis VAC14, a homolog of the yeast and metazoan VAC14s that are crucial for the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. <i>VAC14</i> is constitutively expressed and highly present in developing pollen. Loss of function of <i>VAC14</i> was male gametophyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lethal</span></strong> due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive pollen development. Ultrastructural studies showed that vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I was compromised in <i>vac14</i> mutant microspores, which led to pollen abortion. We further showed that inhibiting the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> or exogenous application of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> mimicked or rescued the pollen developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> of the <i>vac14</i> mutant, respectively. Genetic interference and pharmacological approaches suggested a role of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in pollen germination and tube growth. Our results provide insights into the function of VAC14 and, by inference, that of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in plant cells.</p>

Importance of Translocon Subunit Tic56 for rRNA Processing and Chloroplast Ribosome Assembly
<p>Toc159-containing complexes at the outer chloroplast envelope membrane form stable supercomplexes with a 1-MD translocon at the inner chloroplast envelope membrane of which Tic56 is one essential subunit. While the single mutants <i>tic56-1</i> and <i>ppi2</i> (<i>toc159</i>) have an albino phenotype and are able to grow heterotrophically, we find the double mutant to be embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lethal</span></strong>. Comprehensive quantitative proteome profiling with both single mutants in combination with GeneChip analyses identified a posttranscriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in the accumulation of plastid ribosomal proteins and diminished expression of plastid encoded proteins. In the <i>tic56-1</i> mutant, the assembly of functional ribosomes is furthermore hampered by a processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> of the plastid 23S rRNA. Spectinomycin-treatment of wild-type plants phenocopies the molecular phenotype of plastid proteome accumulation in <i>tic56-1</i> and to a smaller degree also <i>ppi2</i> plastids, suggesting that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in plastid translation is largely responsible for the phenotype of both import mutants. Import experiments with the <i>tic56-3</i> mutant revealed no significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in the import of small ribosomal protein 16 in the absence of full-length Tic56, suggesting that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in ribosome assembly in <i>tic56-1</i> may be independent of a function of Tic56 in protein import. Our data establish a previously unknown link between plastid protein import, the processing of plastid rRNAs, and the assembly of plastid ribosomes and provide further knowledge on the function of the translocon components and the molecular basis for their albino phenotype.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decomposit</span></strong>ion of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> in which lignin and carbohydrates are both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed. Mechanistic studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> coupled with comparative genomic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their evolutionary origins, but the complete suite of genes necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylogenomic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in gene family diversification rates that are correlated with evolution of WR, using data from 62 fungal genomes. We detected 409 gene families that appear to be evolutionarily correlated with WR. The identified gene families encode well-characterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as well as 73 gene families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 identified gene families are present in the genome of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results illuminate the complexity of WR and suggest that its evolution has involved a general elaboration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> apparatus, including numerous gene families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

Pharmacological preconditioning with erythropoietin attenuates the organ injury and dysfunction induced in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock
<p>Pre-treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) has been demonstrated to exert tissue-protective effects against ‘ischemia-reperfusion’-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es. This protection might be mediated by mobilization of bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are thought to secrete paracrine factors. These effects could be exploited to protect against tissue injury induced in cases where hemorrhage is foreseeable, for example, prior to major surgery. Here, we investigate the effects of EPO pre-treatment on the organ injury and dysfunction induced by hemorrhagic shock (HS). Recombinant human EPO (1000 IU/kg/day i.p.) was administered to rats for 3 days. Rats were subjected to HS on day 4 (pre-treatment protocol). Mean arterial pressure was reduced to 35±5 mmHg for 90 minutes, followed by resuscitation with 20 ml/kg Ringer’s lactate for 10 minutes and 50% of the shed blood for 50 minutes. Rats were sacrificed 4 hours after the onset of resuscitation. EPC (CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cell) mobilization was measured following the 3-day pre-treatment with EPO and was significantly increased compared with rats pre-treated with phosphate-buffered saline. EPO pre-treatment significantly attenuated organ injury and dysfunction (renal, hepatic and neuromuscular) caused by HS. In livers from rats subjected to HS, EPO enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt (activation), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β; inhibition) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; activation). In the liver, HS also caused an increase in nuclear translocation of p65 (activation of NF-κB), which was attenuated by EPO. This data suggests that repetitive dosing with EPO prior to injury might protect against the organ injury and dysfunction induced by HS, by a mechanism that might involve mobilization of CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cells, resulting in the activation of the Akt-eNOS survival pathway and inhibition of activation of GSK-3β and NF-κB.</p>

High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin and the Risk Stratification of Patients With Renal Impairment Presenting With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may improve the risk stratification and diagnosis of myocardial infarction, but concentrations can be challenging to interpret in patients with renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment, and the effectiveness of testing in this group is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter study of consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we evaluated the performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in those with and without renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). The negative predictive value and sensitivity of troponin concentrations below the risk stratification threshold (5 ng/L) at presentation were reported for a primary outcome of index type 1 myocardial infarction, or type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. The positive predictive value and specificity at the 99th centile diagnostic threshold (16 ng/L in women, 34 ng/L in men) was determined for index type 1 myocardial infarction.

Fibroblast-Specific Genetic Manipulation of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase In Vivo Reveals Its Central Regulatory Role in Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the heart, acute injury induces a fibrotic healing response that generates collagen-rich scarring that is at first protective but if inappropriately sustained can worsen heart disease. The fibrotic process is initiated by cytokines, neuroendocrine effectors, and mechanical strain that promote resident fibroblast differentiation into contractile and extracellular matrix–producing myofibroblasts. The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α (<i>Mapk14</i> gene) is known to influence the cardiac injury response, but its direct role in orchestrating programmed fibroblast differentiation and fibrosis in vivo is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A conditional <i>Mapk14</i> allele was used to delete the p38α encoding gene specifically in cardiac fibroblasts or myofibroblasts with 2 different tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase–expressing gene–targeted mouse lines. Mice were subjected to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation and monitored for survival, cardiac function, and fibrotic remodeling. Antithetically, mice with fibroblast-specific transgenic overexpression of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, a direct inducer of p38, were generated to investigate whether this pathway can directly drive myofibroblast formation and the cardiac fibrotic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In mice, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of <i>Mapk14</i> blocked cardiac fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and ensuing fibrosis in response to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation. A similar inhibition of myofibroblast formation and healing was also observed in a dermal wounding model with deletion of <i>Mapk14</i>. Transgenic mice with fibroblast-specific activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6–p38 developed interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in the heart, lung, and kidney as a result of enhanced myofibroblast numbers. Mechanistic experiments show that p38 transduces cytokine and mechanical signals into myofibroblast differentiation through the transcription factor serum response factor and the signaling effector calcineurin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings suggest that signals from diverse modes of injury converge on p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase within the fibroblast to program the fibrotic response and myofibroblast formation in vivo, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach with p38 inhibitors for future clinical application.</p></sec>

Tudor-SN–mediated endonucleolytic decay of human cell microRNAs promotes G<sub>1</sub>/S phase transition
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. The pathways that mediate mature miRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> are less well understood than those that mediate miRNA biogenesis. We found that functional miRNAs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed in human cells by the endonuclease Tudor-SN (TSN). In vitro, recombinant TSN initiated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> of both protein-free and Argonaute 2–loaded miRNAs via endonucleolytic cleavage at CA and UA dinucleotides, preferentially at scissile bonds located more than five nucleotides away from miRNA ends. Cellular targets of TSN-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> defined using microRNA sequencing followed this rule. Inhibiting TSN-mediated miRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of TSN inhibited cell cycle progression by up-regulating a cohort of miRNAs that down-regulates mRNAs that encode proteins critical for the G<sub>1</sub>-to-S phase transition. Our study indicates that targeting TSN nuclease activity could inhibit pathological cell proliferation.</p>

Synaptotagmin-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum-Plasma Membrane Contact Sites Are Localized to Immobile ER Tubules
<p>The plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is morphologically divided into tubules and sheets, seems to flow continuously as a whole, but locally, mobile and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e regions exist. In eukaryotes, the ER physically and functionally interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) at domains called ER-PM contact sites (EPCSs). Extended synaptotagmin family proteins are concentrated in the cortical ER to form one type of EPCS; however, it is unclear whether the localization of extended synaptotagmin corresponds to the EPCS and where in the cortical ER the EPCSs are formed. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal localization of SYNAPTOTAGMIN1 (SYT1), a synaptotagmin in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), to investigate the precise distribution of SYT1-associated EPCSs in the cortical ER. Three-dimensional imaging using superresolution confocal live imaging microscopy demonstrated that SYT1 was specifically localized to the ER-PM boundary. Time-lapse imaging revealed that SYT1 was distributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e ER tubules, but not to mobile tubules. Moreover, SYT1 was frequently localized to the edges of ER sheets that were transformed into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e ER tubules over time. A lower intracellular calcium ion concentration resulted in an increased EPCS area and disrupted the ER network. Finally, SYT1 deficiency caused a reduction of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e tubules and enlargement of the ER meshes. Taken together, our findings show that SYT1-associated EPCS are distributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e tubules and play an important role in the formation of the tubular ER network. This provides important insight into the relationship between the function and dynamics/morphology of the cortical ER.</p>

Transcriptome Analysis Identifies a Zinc Finger Protein Regulating Starch Degradation in Kiwifruit
<p>Ripening, including softening, is a critical factor in determining the postharvest shelf-life of fruit and is controlled by enzymes involved in cell wall metabolism, starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, and hormone metabolism. Here, we used a transcriptomics-based approach to identify transcriptional regulatory components associated with texture, ethylene, and starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation in ripening kiwifruit (<i>Actinidia deliciosa</i>). Twelve differentially expressed structural genes, including seven involved in cell wall metabolism, four in ethylene biosynthesis, and one in starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, and 14 transcription factors (TFs) induced by exogenous ethylene treatment and inhibited by the ethylene signaling inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene were identified as changing in transcript levels during ripening. Moreover, analysis of the regulatory effects of differentially expressed genes identified a zinc finger TF, DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (AdDof3), which showed significant transactivation on the <i>AdBAM3L</i> (β-amylase) promoter. AdDof3 interacted physically with the <i>AdBAM3L</i> promoter, and stable overexpression of <i>AdBAM3L</i> resulted in lower starch content in transgenic kiwifruit leaves, suggesting that <i>AdBAM3L</i> is a key gene for starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Moreover, transient overexpression analysis showed that AdDof3 up-regulated <i>AdBAM3L</i> expression in kiwifruit. Thus, transcriptomics analysis not only allowed the prediction of some ripening-regulating genes but also facilitated the characterization of a TF, AdDof3, and a key structural gene, <i>AdBAM3L</i>, in starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation.</p>

The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase RHA2b Promotes Degradation of MYB30 in Abscisic Acid Signaling
<p>The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical for plants encountering abiotic stress. We reported previously that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transcription factor MYB30 participates in ABA responses via SUMO ligase SAP-MIZ Domain-Containing SIZ1-mediated sumoylation. Here, we show that the RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase RHA2b, which positively regulates ABA signaling, interacted with and ubiquitinated MYB30 to modulate MYB30 stability through the 26S proteasome pathway. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation rate of MYB30 was repressed significantly in the <i>rha2b-1</i> mutant. Phenotypic analyses showed that <i>MYB30</i> acts genetically downstream of <i>RHA2b</i> in ABA signaling. Substitutions of lysine-283 (K283) and K165 blocked ubiquitination, suggesting that these residues are sites of ubiquitination. K283 residue substitution significantly inhibited the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of MYB30 induced by ABA. The K165 site functioned additively with K283 in ABA-induced MYB30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and ABA responses. At the same time, sumoylation protected MYB30 from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation under cycloheximide and ABA treatment. Compared with MYB30, overexpression of MYB30-SUMO1 partially recovered the ABA sensitivity of <i>siz1-2</i>. But MYB30-SUMO1 exhibited similar localization with MYB30 in nuclei. Overall, our results suggest that RHA2b targets MYB30 for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation to modulate ABA signaling. Considering that the K283 residue also is the major site for sumoylation, we propose that sumoylation and ubiquitination act antagonistically in the ABA response to regulate the stability of MYB30 by occupying the same residue.</p>

Scopoletin 8-Hydroxylase-Mediated Fraxetin Production Is Crucial for Iron Mobilization
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral nutrient and an important factor for the composition of natural plant communities. Low Fe availability in aerated soils with neutral or alkaline pH has led to the evolution of elaborate mechanisms that extract Fe from the soil solution. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), Fe is acquired by an orchestrated strategy that comprises mobilization, chelation, and reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> prior to its uptake. Here, we show that At3g12900, previously annotated as scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H), participates in Fe acquisition by mediating the biosynthesis of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin), a coumarin derived from the scopoletin pathway. S8H is highly induced in roots of Fe-deficient plants both at the transcript and protein levels. Mutants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive in the expression of <i>S8H</i> showed increased sensitivity to growth on pH 7.0 media supplemented with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e source of Fe and reduced secretion of fraxetin. Transgenic lines overexpressing <i>S8H</i> exhibited an opposite phenotype. Homozygous <i>s8h</i> mutants grown on media with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>ized Fe accumulated significantly more scopolin, the storage form of scopoletin, supporting the designated function of S8H in scopoletin hydroxylation. Fraxetin exhibited Fe-reducing properties in vitro with higher rates being observed at neutral relative to acidic pH. Supplementing the media containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e Fe with fraxetin partially rescued the <i>s8h</i> mutants. In natural Arabidopsis accessions differing in their performance on media containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>ized Fe, the amount of secreted fraxetin was highly correlated with growth and Fe and chlorophyll content, indicating that fraxetin secretion is a decisive factor for calcicole-calcifuge behavior (i.e. the ability/inability to thrive on alkaline soils) of plants.</p>

Clathrin Heavy Chain Subunits Coordinate Endo- and Exocytic Traffic and Affect Stomatal Movement
<p>The current model for vesicular traffic to and from the plasma membrane is accepted, but the molecular requirements for this coordination are not well defined. We have identified the <i>hot ABA-deficiency suppressor1</i> mutant, which has a stomatal function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>, as a <i>clathrin heavy chain1</i> (<i>CHC1</i>) mutant allele and show that it has a decreased rate of endocytosis and growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s that are shared with other <i>chc1</i> mutant alleles. We used <i>chc1</i> alleles and the related <i>chc2</i> mutant as tools to investigate the effects that clathrin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s have on secretion pathways and plant growth. We show that secretion and endocytosis at the plasma membrane are sensitive to CHC1 and CHC2 function in seedling roots and that <i>chc</i> mutants have physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in stomatal function and plant growth that have not been described previously. These findings suggest that clathrin supports specific functions in multiple cell types. Stomata movement and gas exchange are altered in <i>chc</i> mutants, indicating that clathrin is important for stomatal regulation. The aberrant function of <i>chc</i> mutant stomata is consistent with the growth phenotypes observed under different water and light conditions, which also are similar to those of the secretory SNARE mutant, <i>syp121</i>. The <i>syp121</i> and <i>chc</i> mutants have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed endocytosis and exocytosis compared with the wild type, indicating a link between SYP121-dependent secretion and clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Our findings provide evidence that clathrin and SYP121 functions are important for the coordination of endocytosis and exocytosis and have an impact on stomatal function, gas exchange, and vegetative growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Leaf Starch Turnover Occurs in Long Days and in Falling Light at the End of the Day
<p>We investigated whether starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation occurs at the same time as starch synthesis in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves in the light. Starch accumulated in a linear fashion for about 12 h after dawn, then accumulation slowed and content plateaued. Following decreases in light intensity, the rate of accumulation of starch declined in proportion to the decline in photosynthesis if the decrease occurred <10 h after dawn, but accumulation ceased or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of starch occurred if the same decrease in light intensity was imposed more than 10 h after dawn. These changes in starch accumulation patterns after prolonged periods in the light occurred at both high and low starch contents and were not related to time-dependent changes in either the rate of photosynthesis or the partitioning of assimilate between starch and Suc, as assessed from metabolite measurements and <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> pulse experiments. Instead, measurements of incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C from <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> into starch and of levels of the starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation product maltose showed that substantial starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation occurred simultaneously with synthesis at time points >14 h after dawn and in response to decreases in light intensity that occurred >10 h after dawn. Starch measurements in circadian clock mutants suggested that the clock influences the timing of onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. We conclude that the propensity for leaf starch to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed increases with time after dawn. The importance of this phenomenon for efficient use of carbon for growth in long days and for prevention of starvation during twilight is discussed.</p>

The PEX1 ATPase Stabilizes PEX6 and Plays Essential Roles in Peroxisome Biology
<p>A variety of metabolic pathways are sequestered in peroxisomes, conserved organelles that are essential for human and plant survival. Peroxin (PEX) proteins generate and maintain peroxisomes. The PEX1 ATPase facilitates recycling of the peroxisome matrix protein receptor PEX5 and is the most commonly affected peroxin in human peroxisome biogenesis disorders. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of, to our knowledge, the first Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>pex1</i> missense alleles: <i>pex1-2</i> and <i>pex1-3</i>. <i>pex1-2</i> displayed peroxisome-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s accompanied by reduced PEX1 and PEX6 levels. These <i>pex1-2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s were exacerbated by growth at high temperature and ameliorated by growth at low temperature or by <i>PEX6</i> overexpression, suggesting that PEX1 enhances PEX6 stability and vice versa. <i>pex1-3</i> conferred embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lethal</span></strong>ity when homozygous, confirming that PEX1, like several other Arabidopsis peroxins, is essential for embryogenesis. <i>pex1-3</i> displayed symptoms of peroxisome dysfunction when heterozygous; this semidominance is consistent with PEX1 forming a heterooligomer with PEX6 that is poisoned by pex1-3 subunits. Blocking autophagy partially rescued <i>PEX1</i>/<i>pex1-3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, including the restoration of normal peroxisome size, suggesting that increasing peroxisome abundance can compensate for the deficiencies caused by <i>pex1-3</i> and that the enlarged peroxisomes visible in <i>PEX1</i>/<i>pex1-3</i> may represent autophagy intermediates. Overexpressing <i>PEX1</i> in wild-type plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed growth, suggesting that excessive PEX1 can be detrimental. Our genetic, molecular, and physiological data support the heterohexamer model of PEX1-PEX6 function in plants.</p>

Analysis of Arabidopsis Accessions Hypersensitive to a Loss of Chloroplast Translation
<p>Natural accessions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differ in their ability to tolerate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of chloroplast translation. These differences can be attributed in part to variation in a duplicated nuclear gene (<i>ACC2</i>) that targets homomeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) to plastids. This functional redundancy allows limited fatty acid biosynthesis to occur in the absence of heteromeric ACCase, which is encoded in part by the plastid genome. In the presence of functional <i>ACC2</i>, tolerant alleles of several nuclear genes, not yet identified, enhance the growth of seedlings and embryos disrupted in chloroplast translation. <i>ACC2</i> knockout mutants, by contrast, are hypersensitive. Here we describe an expanded search for hypersensitive accessions of Arabidopsis, evaluate whether all of these accessions are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive in <i>ACC2</i>, and characterize genotype-to-phenotype relationships for homomeric ACCase variants identified among 855 accessions with sequenced genomes. Null alleles with <i>ACC2</i> nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, small deletions, genomic rearrangements, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in RNA splicing are included among the most sensitive accessions examined. By contrast, most missense mutations affecting highly conserved residues failed to eliminate ACC2 function. Several accessions were identified where sensitivity could not be attributed to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in either ACC2 or Tic20-IV, the chloroplast membrane channel required for ACC2 uptake. Overall, these results underscore the central role of <i>ACC2</i> in mediating Arabidopsis response to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of chloroplast translation, highlight future applications of this system to analyzing chloroplast protein import, and provide valuable insights into the mutational landscape of an important metabolic enzyme that is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen development.</p>

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of stem hydraulic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of stem hydraulic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of hydraulic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its hydraulic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

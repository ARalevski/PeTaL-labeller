Plio-Pleistocene decline of African megaherbivores: No evidence for ancient hominin impacts
<p>It has long been proposed that pre-modern hominin impacts drove extinctions and shaped the evolutionary history of Africa’s exceptionally diverse large mammal communities, but this hypothesis has yet to be rigorously tested. We analyzed eastern African herbivore communities spanning the past 7 million years—encompassing the entirety of hominin evolutionary history—to test the hypothesis that top-down impacts of tool-bearing, meat-eating hominins contributed to the demise of megaherbivores prior to the emergence of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. We document a steady, long-term decline of megaherbivores beginning ~4.6 million years ago, long before the appearance of hominin species capable of exerting top-down control of large mammal communities and predating evidence for hominin interactions with megaherbivore prey. Expansion of C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grassland</span></strong>s can account for the loss of megaherbivore diversity.</p>

Rapid Pliocene adaptive radiation of modern kangaroos
<p>Differentiating between ancient and younger, more rapidly evolved clades is important for determining paleoenvironmental drivers of diversification. Australia possesses many aridity-adapted lineages, the origins of which have been closely linked to late Miocene continental aridification. Using dental macrowear and molar crown height measurements, spanning the past 25 million years, we show that the most iconic Australian terrestrial mammals, “true” kangaroos (Macropodini), adaptively radiated in response to mid-Pliocene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grassland</span></strong> expansion rather than Miocene aridity. In contrast, low-crowned, short-faced kangaroos radiated into predominantly browsing niches as the late Cenozoic became more arid, contradicting the view that this was an interval of global browser decline. Our results implicate warm-to-cool climatic oscillations as a trigger for adaptive radiation and refute arguments attributing Pleistocene megafaunal extinction to aridity-forced dietary change.</p>

Unexpected reversal of C<sub>3</sub> versus C<sub>4</sub> grass response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> during a 20-year field experiment
<p>Theory predicts and evidence shows that plant species that use the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway (C<sub>4</sub> species) are less responsive to elevated carbon dioxide (<i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub>) than species that use only the C<sub>3</sub> pathway (C<sub>3</sub> species). We document a reversal from this expected C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> contrast. Over the first 12 years of a 20-year free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment experiment with 88 C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grassland</span></strong> plots, we found that biomass was markedly enhanced at <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> relative to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> in C<sub>3</sub> but not C<sub>4</sub> plots, as expected. During the subsequent 8 years, the pattern reversed: Biomass was markedly enhanced at <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> relative to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> in C<sub>4</sub> but not C<sub>3</sub> plots. Soil net nitrogen mineralization rates, an index of soil nitrogen supply, exhibited a similar shift: <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> first enhanced but later depressed rates in C<sub>3</sub> plots, with the opposite true in C<sub>4</sub> plots, partially explaining the reversal of the <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> biomass response. These findings challenge the current C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> paradigm and show that even the best-supported short-term drivers of plant response to global change might not predict long-term results.</p>

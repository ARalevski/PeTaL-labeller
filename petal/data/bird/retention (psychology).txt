Crystallizing a memory
<p>What is the physical basis of memory? What does it take to retrieve a memory in the brain? What would it take to activate or erase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es? In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to denote the physical manifestation of a memory in the brain (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb posited a physiological correlate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and recollection: The process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing strengthens the connections, or synapses, between neurons, which leads to the development of brain-wide cell assemblies that undergo changes in their structural and functional connectivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these assemblies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable neuronal correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es are formed, the dynamics of these assemblies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the brain processes the variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the brain and modulate them in a synapse-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

Energy pulses reveal possible new state of memory
<p>Memory researchers have shone light into a cognitive limbo. A new memory—the name of someone you've just met, for example—is held for seconds in so-called working memory, as your brain's neurons continue to fire. If the person is important to you, the name will over a few days enter your long-term memory, preserved by permanently altered neural connections. But where does it go during the in-between hours, when it has left your standard working memory and is not yet embedded in long-term memory? To figure this out, a research team resurrects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es from this limbo. Their observations point to a new form of working memory, which they dub prioritized long-term memory, that exists without elevated neural activity. Consistent with other recent work, the study suggests that information can somehow be held among the synapses that connect neurons, even after conventional working memory has faded. This new memory state could have a range of practical implications, from helping college students <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> more efficiently to assisting people with memory-related neurological conditions such as amnesia, epilepsy, and schizophrenia.</p>

Synapse-specific representation of the identity of overlapping memory engrams
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es are integrated into interconnected networks; nevertheless, each memory has its own identity. How the brain defines specific memory identity out of intermingled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es stored in a shared cell ensemble has remained elusive. We found that after complete retrograde amnesia of auditory fear conditioning in mice, optogenetic stimulation of the auditory inputs to the lateral amygdala failed to induce memory recall, implying that the memory engram no longer existed in that circuit. Complete amnesia of a given fear memory did not affect another linked fear memory encoded in the shared ensemble. Optogenetic potentiation or depotentiation of the plasticity at synapses specific to one memory affected the recall of only that memory. Thus, the sharing of engram cells underlies the linkage between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es, whereas synapse-specific plasticity guarantees the identity and storage of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es.</p>

Retrieval practice protects memory against acute stress
<p>More than a decade of research has supported a robust consensus: Acute stress impairs memory retrieval. We aimed to determine whether a highly effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing technique could strengthen memory against the negative effects of stress. To bolster memory, we used retrieval practice, or the act of taking practice tests. Participants first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed stimuli by either restudying or engaging in retrieval practice. Twenty-four hours later, we induced stress in half of the participants and assessed subsequent memory performance. Participants who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed by restudying demonstrated the typical stress-related memory impairment, whereas those who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed by retrieval practice were immune to the deleterious effects of stress. These results suggest that the effects of stress on memory retrieval may be contingent on the strength of the memory representations themselves.</p>

β-Arrestin–biased β-adrenergic signaling promotes extinction learning of cocaine reward memory
<p>Extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-associated contextual cues can help prevent cocaine addicts from relapsing. Pharmacological manipulation of β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) during extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing is being developed as a potential strategy to treat drug addiction. We demonstrated that the extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-associated memory was mediated by β-arrestin2–biased but not heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–dependent β-adrenergic signaling. We found that administration of the nonbiased β-AR antagonist propranolol, but not the G protein–biased β-AR antagonist carvedilol, blocked extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-conditioned place preference and the associated ERK activation in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex. Overexpression of β-arrestin2 in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex promoted extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, which was blocked by propranolol. Knockout of β-arrestin2 in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex, specifically in excitatory neurons, impaired extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-conditioned place preference, which was not rescued by carvedilol. β-Arrestin2 signaling in infralimbic excitatory neurons was also required for the extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing in the cocaine self-administration model. Our results suggest that β-arrestin–biased β-adrenergic signaling in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex regulates extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es and could be therapeutically targeted to treat addiction.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous system function (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous systems, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

New dimensions for brain mapping
<p>The representation of memory in the brain is one of the unresolved questions in neuroscience. A key feature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory is the process of neuroplasticity—the ability of the brain to remodel structurally and functionally as a result of cognitive experience. Although the neurobiological basis of this process (that is, synaptic plasticity) is well established, the system level dynamics of neuroplasticity are still unclear. Recently, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), which can be carried out noninvasively in humans, provided a new approach to explore neuroplasticity. One of the parameters extracted from DW-MRI is mean diffusivity (MD) of water molecules, which is a biomarker of tissue microstructure (<i>1</i>). By probing changes in MD across the brain, areas of microstructural plasticity can be detected within hours of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing. On page 1045 of this issue, Brodt <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) used DW-MRI after an object-location memory task and found that brain plasticity occurs in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) rather than in the hippocampus. Furthermore, they demonstrated that localized DW-MRI changes follow the basic definition of a memory engram (the physical manifestation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es stored in the brain). These observations go beyond the understanding of memory representation in the brain. Probing MD with DW-MRI appears to provide a detailed and comprehensive monitoring of brain microanatomy, revealing uncharted relations between brain structure and function.</p>

Making room for new memories
<p>What are our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es made of? Plato suggested imagining a block of wax in our soul, where perceptions and thoughts leave impressions that we can remember as long as they have not been erased. This historic metaphor captures the transience of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es and the stability of others, and it illustrates the brain's plasticity. The mechanisms of memory formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retent</span></strong>ion remain a key question in neuroscience. Groundbreaking work on the rodent hippocampus (a network in the temporal lobe) revealed that certain neurons form transiently stable representations of places (<i>1</i>). Hence, this brain region has become an important focus for studying spatial memory (or engram) formation. It also serves as an experimentally accessible proxy for declarative (knowledge) and episodic (experience) memory in humans, which involves the same brain structures and mechanisms. However, how can we remember an almost infinite number of items with the limited storage capacity of the hippocampus? There is good evidence that relevant representations are transferred to neocortical networks before forming long-lasting engrams. The hippocampus is then reset for acquisition of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es. Studies in animals (<i>2</i>) and humans (<i>3</i>) show that neuronal activity during sleep plays a major role in these processes. The underlying mechanisms, however, have remained mostly enigmatic. On page 1524 of this issue, Norimoto <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) show how sleep-associated activity patterns induce “negative” neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, erasing remote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es. A previous, related paper by Khodagholy <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) reveals similar activity patterns in the neocortex, which, hence, may mediate long-term consolidation of transient engrams at their final location.</p>

Engrams and circuits crucial for systems consolidation of a memory
<p>Episodic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es initially require rapid synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus for their formation and are gradually consolidated in neocortical networks for permanent storage. However, the engrams and circuits that support neocortical memory consolidation have thus far been unknown. We found that neocortical prefrontal memory engram cells, which are critical for remote contextual fear memory, were rapidly generated during initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing through inputs from both the hippocampal–entorhinal cortex network and the basolateral amygdala. After their generation, the prefrontal engram cells, with support from hippocampal memory engram cells, became functionally mature with time. Whereas hippocampal engram cells gradually became silent with time, engram cells in the basolateral amygdala, which were necessary for fear memory, were maintained. Our data provide new insights into the functional reorganization of engrams and circuits underlying systems consolidation of memory.</p>

Olfactory memories are intensity specific in larval <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing can rely on stimulus quality, stimulus intensity, or a combination of these. Regarding olfaction, the coding of odour quality is often proposed to be combinatorial along the olfactory pathway, and working hypotheses are available concerning short-term associative memory trace formation of odour quality. However, it is less clear how odour intensity is coded, and whether olfactory memory traces include information about the intensity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>t odour. Using odour–sugar associative conditioning in larval <i>Drosophila</i>, we first describe the dose–effect curves of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ability across odour intensities for four different odours (<i>n</i>-amyl acetate, 3-octanol, 1-octen-3-ol and benzaldehyde). We then chose odour intensities such that larvae were trained at an intermediate odour intensity, but were tested for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retent</span></strong>ion with either that trained intermediate odour intensity, or with respectively higher or lower intensities. We observed a specificity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retent</span></strong>ion for the trained intensity for all four odours used. This adds to the appreciation of the richness in ‘content’ of olfactory short-term memory traces, even in a system as simple as larval <i>Drosophila</i>, and to define the demands on computational models of associative olfactory memory trace formation. We suggest two kinds of circuit architecture that have the potential to accommodate intensity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, and discuss how they may be implemented in the insect brain.</p>

Insular cortex processes aversive somatosensory information and is crucial for threat learning
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing about threats is essential for survival. During threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, an innocuous sensory percept such as a tone acquires an emotional meaning when paired with an aversive stimulus such as a mild footshock. The amygdala is critical for threat memory formation, but little is known about upstream brain areas that process aversive somatosensory information. Using optogenetic techniques in mice, we found that silencing of the posterior insula during footshock reduced acute fear behavior and impaired 1-day threat memory. Insular cortex neurons respond to footshocks, acquire responses to tones during threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, and project to distinct amygdala divisions to drive acute fear versus threat memory formation. Thus, the posterior insula conveys aversive footshock information to the amygdala and is crucial for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing about potential dangers in the environment.</p>

The hippocampal engram maps experience but not place
<p>Episodic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es are encoded by a sparse population of hippocampal neurons. In mice, optogenetic manipulation of this memory engram established that these neurons are indispensable and inducing for memory recall. However, little is known about their in vivo activity or precise role in memory. We found that during memory encoding, only a fraction of CA1 place cells function as engram neurons, distinguished by firing repetitive bursts paced at the theta frequency. During memory recall, these neurons remained highly context specific, yet demonstrated preferential remapping of their place fields. These data demonstrate a dissociation of precise spatial coding and contextual indexing by distinct hippocampal ensembles and suggest that the hippocampal engram serves as an index of memory content.</p>

Wire together, fire apart
<p>The ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> and remember new experiences lies at the heart of our existence. After all, we are our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es. It has been widely accepted that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es are formed and stored via strengthening of neural connections due to the correlated activities of neurons, where presumably one neuron is causing or at least contributing to the activity of another connecting neuron and hence becomes associated with it. This principle is known as the Hebbian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing rule (<i>1</i>): i.e., if interconnected neurons become active very close in time during a particular event, their connection strengthens and “a memory” of this event is formed (<i>1</i>). In other words, “neurons wire together, if they fire together” (<i>2</i>). Thus, neural connection must show some sort of plasticity—i.e., an ability to be modified based on the mutual firing patterns of interconnected neurons—in order to form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es and associations. Indeed, it has been shown that brief (hundreds of milliseconds) stimulations of interconnected neurons significantly improve signal transmission between the two, a phenomenon known as long-term potentiation (LTP). On page 1033 of this issue, Bittner <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing mechanism called behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), which spans a considerably longer time course of several seconds, implying that no causal relationship of interconnected neurons may be necessary to form long-lasting associations between them.</p>

Overlapping memory trace indispensable for linking, but not recalling, individual memories
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es are not stored in isolation from other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es but are integrated into associative networks. However, the mechanisms underlying memory association remain elusive. Using two amygdala-dependent behavioral paradigms—conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and auditory-cued fear conditioning (AFC)—in mice, we found that presenting the conditioned stimulus used for the CTA task triggered the conditioned response of the AFC task after natural coreactivation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es. This was accompanied through an increase in the overlapping neuronal ensemble in the basolateral amygdala. Silencing of the overlapping ensemble suppressed CTA retrieval-induced freezing. However, retrieval of the original CTA or AFC memory was not affected. A small population of coshared neurons thus mediates the link between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es.

Reactivation of latent working memories with transcranial magnetic stimulation
<p>The ability to hold information in working memory is fundamental for cognition. Contrary to the long-standing view that working memory depends on sustained, elevated activity, we present evidence suggesting that humans can hold information in working memory via “activity-silent” synaptic mechanisms. Using multivariate pattern analyses to decode brain activity patterns, we found that the active representation of an item in working memory drops to baseline when attention shifts away. A targeted pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation produced a brief reemergence of the item in concurrently measured brain activity. This reactivation effect occurred and influenced memory performance only when the item was potentially relevant later in the trial, which suggests that the representation is dynamic and modifiable via cognitive control. The results support a synaptic theory of working memory.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Arabidopsis DNA Methylome Is Stable under Transgenerational Drought Stress
<p>Improving the responsiveness, acclimation, and memory of plants to abiotic stress holds substantive potential for improving agriculture. An unresolved question is the involvement of chromatin marks in the memory of agriculturally relevant stresses. Such potential has spurred numerous investigations yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust stress-induced DNA methylation variation can underpin stress memory. Using a slow-onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we investigated the malleability of the DNA methylome to drought stress within a generation and under repeated drought stress over five successive generations. While drought-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected within a generation, they did not correlate with drought-responsive gene expression. Six traits were analyzed for transgenerational stress memory, and the descendants of drought-stressed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one generation removed from stress. With respect to transgenerational drought stress, there were negligible conserved differentially methylated regions in drought-exposed lineages compared with unstressed lineages. Instead, the majority of observed variation was tied to stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the experience of repeated drought stress was not observed to influence transgenerational epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that, while transgenerational memory is observed in one of six traits examined, they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to drought stress.</p>

The acid-sensing ion channel ASIC1a mediates striatal synapse remodeling and procedural motor learning
<p>Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is abundant in multiple brain regions, including the striatum, which serves as the input nucleus of the basal ganglia and is critically involved in procedural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and motor memory. We investigated the functional role of ASIC1a in striatal neurons. We found that ASIC1a was critical for striatum-dependent motor coordination and procedural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing by regulating the synaptic plasticity of striatal medium spiny neurons. Global deletion of <i>Asic1a</i> in mice led to increased dendritic spine density but impaired spine morphology and postsynaptic architecture, which were accompanied by the decreased function of <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptors at excitatory synapses. These structural and functional changes caused by the loss of ASIC1a were largely mediated by reduced activation (phosphorylation) of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and extracellular signal–regulated protein kinases (ERKs). Consequently, <i>Asic1a</i> null mice exhibited poor performance on multiple motor tasks, which was rescued by striatal-specific expression of either ASIC1a or CaMKII. Together, our data reveal a previously unknown mechanism mediated by ASIC1a that promotes the excitatory synaptic function underlying striatum-related procedural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory.</p>

Learning-dependent chromatin remodeling highlights noncoding regulatory regions linked to autism
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with genetic risk factors. Most human disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not located in genes but rather are in regulatory regions that control gene expression. The function of regulatory regions is determined through epigenetic mechanisms. Parallels between the cellular basis of development and the formation of long-term memory have long been recognized, particularly the role of epigenetic mechanisms in both processes. We analyzed how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing alters chromatin accessibility in the mouse hippocampus using a new high-throughput sequencing bioinformatics strategy we call DEScan (differential enrichment scan). DEScan, which enabled the analysis of data from epigenomic experiments containing multiple replicates, revealed changes in chromatin accessibility at 2365 regulatory regions—most of which were promoters. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing-regulated promoters were active during forebrain development in mice and were enriched in epigenetic modifications indicative of bivalent promoters. These promoters were disproportionally intronic, showed a complex relationship with gene expression and alternative splicing during memory consolidation and retrieval, and were enriched in the data set relative to known ASD risk genes. Genotyping in a clinical cohort within one of these promoters (<i>SHANK3</i> promoter 6) revealed that the SNP rs6010065 was associated with ASD. Our data support the idea that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing recapitulates development at the epigenetic level and demonstrate that behaviorally induced epigenetic changes in mice can highlight regulatory regions relevant to brain disorders in patients.</p>

Coupled ripple oscillations between the medial temporal lobe and neocortex retrieve human memory
<p>Episodic memory retrieval relies on the recovery of neural representations of waking experience. This process is thought to involve a communication dynamic between the medial temporal lobe memory system and the neocortex. How this occurs is largely unknown, however, especially as it pertains to awake human memory retrieval. Using intracranial electroencephalographic recordings, we found that ripple oscillations were dynamically coupled between the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) and temporal association cortex. Coupled ripples were more pronounced during successful verbal memory retrieval and recover the cortical neural representations of remembered items. Together, these data provide direct evidence that coupled ripples between the MTL and association cortex may underlie successful memory retrieval in the human brain.</p>

Reactivation of recall-induced neurons contributes to remote fear memory attenuation
<p>Whether fear attenuation is mediated by inhibition of the original memory trace of fear with a new memory trace of safety or by updating of the original fear trace toward safety has been a long-standing question in neuroscience and psychology alike. In particular, which of the two scenarios underlies the attenuation of remote (month-old) fear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es is completely unknown, despite the impetus to better understand this process against the backdrop of enduring traumata. We found—chemogenetically and in an engram-specific manner—that effective remote fear attenuation is accompanied by the reactivation of memory recall–induced neurons in the dentate gyrus and that the continued activity of these neurons is critical for fear reduction. This suggests that the original memory trace of fear actively contributes to remote fear attenuation.</p>

Interregional synaptic maps among engram cells underlie memory formation
<p>Memory resides in engram cells distributed across the brain. However, the site-specific substrate within these engram cells remains theoretical, even though it is generally accepted that synaptic plasticity encodes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es. We developed the dual-eGRASP (green fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partners) technique to examine synapses between engram cells to identify the specific neuronal site for memory storage. We found an increased number and size of spines on CA1 engram cells receiving input from CA3 engram cells. In contextual fear conditioning, this enhanced connectivity between engram cells encoded memory strength. CA3 engram to CA1 engram projections strongly occluded long-term potentiation. These results indicate that enhanced structural and functional connectivity between engram cells across two directly connected brain regions forms the synaptic correlate for memory formation.</p>

Controlling learning and epilepsy together
<p>The dentate gyrus (DG) is a region in the hippocampus of the brain that is important for many cognitive functions, such as spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory, and understanding our environment or context (<i>1</i>). The DG is also considered to be important in many diseases, some of which surprisingly do not appear to be related to memory, such as temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (<i>2</i>). One explanation is based on the idea that the DG is an inhibitory filter or gate (<i>3</i>, <i>4</i>), preventing too much information from corrupting memory formation as well as preventing seizures. However, it is unclear exactly how and when the DG limits the influence of afferent input to the hippocampus, and when the DG is permissive, because the DG has powerful excitatory and inhibitory characteristics. For example, the DG contains mossy cells (MCs), which have both characteristics (<i>5</i>). On page 787 of this issue, Bui <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) show that silencing MCs impairs a spatial memory task and also terminates seizures in an animal model of TLE, which could improve our understanding of TLE as well as cognitive comorbidities.</p>

The epigenetic control of stemness in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell fate commitment
<p>After priming, naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes establish specific heritable transcription programs that define progression to long-lasting memory cells or to short-lived effector cells. Although lineage specification is critical for protection, it remains unclear how chromatin dynamics contributes to the control of gene expression programs. We explored the role of gene silencing by the histone methyltransferase Suv39h1. In murine CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activated after <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> infection, Suv39h1-dependent trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 controls the expression of a set of stem cell–related memory genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a defect in silencing of stem/memory genes selectively in <i>Suv39h1</i>-defective T cell effectors. As a result, <i>Suv39h1</i>-defective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells show sustained survival and increased long-term memory reprogramming capacity. Thus, Suv39h1 plays a critical role in marking chromatin to silence stem/memory genes during CD8<sup>+</sup> T effector terminal differentiation.</p>

Ventral CA1 neurons store social memory
<p>The medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, has been implicated in social memory. However, it remains unknown which parts of these brain regions and their circuits hold social memory. Here, we show that ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) neurons of a mouse and their projections to nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell play a necessary and sufficient role in social memory. Both the proportion of activated vCA1 cells and the strength and stability of the responding cells are greater in response to a familiar mouse than to a previously unencountered mouse. Optogenetic reactivation of vCA1 neurons that respond to the familiar mouse enabled memory retrieval and the association of these neurons with unconditioned stimuli. Thus, vCA1 neurons and their NAc shell projections are a component of the storage site of social memory.</p>

Rac signal adaptation controls neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow
<p>Mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow determines neutrophil blood counts and thus is medically important. Balanced neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow depends on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retent</span></strong>ion-promoting chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 and the egression-promoting chemokine CXCL2 and its receptor CXCR2. Both pathways activate the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, leaving the role of this signaling event in neutrophil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retent</span></strong>ion and egression ambiguous. On the assumption that active Rac determines persistent directional cell migration, we generated a mathematical model to link chemokine-mediated Rac modulation to neutrophil egression time. Our computer simulation indicated that, in the bone marrow, where the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retent</span></strong>ion signal predominated, egression time strictly depended on the time it took Rac to return to its basal activity (namely, adaptation). This prediction was validated in mice lacking the Rac inhibitor ArhGAP15. Neutrophils in these mice showed prolonged Rac adaptation and cell-autonomous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retent</span></strong>ion in the bone marrow. Our model thus demonstrates that mobilization in the presence of two spatially defined opposing chemotactic cues strictly depends on inhibitors shaping the time course of signal adaptation. Furthermore, our findings might help to find new modes of intervention to treat conditions characterized by excessively low or high circulating neutrophils.</p>

Induction of CD4 T cell memory by local cellular collectivity
<p>Cell differentiation is directed by signals driving progenitors into specialized cell types. This process can involve collective decision-making, when differentiating cells determine their lineage choice by interacting with each other. We used live-cell imaging in microwell arrays to study collective processes affecting differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into memory precursors. We found that differentiation of precursor memory T cells sharply increases above a threshold number of locally interacting cells. These homotypic interactions involve the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-6, which affect memory differentiation orthogonal to their effect on proliferation and survival. Mathematical modeling suggests that the differentiation rate is continuously modulated by the instantaneous number of locally interacting cells. This cellular collectivity can prioritize allocation of immune memory to stronger responses.</p>

Hippocampal ripples down-regulate synapses
<p>The specific effects of sleep on synaptic plasticity remain unclear. We report that mouse hippocampal sharp-wave ripple oscillations serve as intrinsic events that trigger long-lasting synaptic depression. Silencing of sharp-wave ripples during slow-wave states prevented the spontaneous down-regulation of net synaptic weights and impaired the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es. The synaptic down-regulation was dependent on the <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor and selective for a specific input pathway. Thus, our findings are consistent with the role of slow-wave states in refining memory engrams by reducing recent memory-irrelevant neuronal activity and suggest a previously unrecognized function for sharp-wave ripples.</p>

Conversion of object identity to object-general semantic value in the primate temporal cortex

Causal neural network of metamemory for retrospection in primates
<p>We know how confidently we know: Metacognitive self-monitoring of memory states, so-called “metamemory,” enables strategic and efficient information collection based on past experiences. However, it is unknown how metamemory is implemented in the brain. We explored causal neural mechanism of metamemory in macaque monkeys performing metacognitive confidence judgments on memory. By whole-brain searches via functional magnetic resonance imaging, we discovered a neural correlate of metamemory for temporally remote events in prefrontal area 9 (or 9/46d), along with that for recent events within area 6. Reversible inactivation of each of these identified loci induced doubly dissociated selective impairments in metacognitive judgment performance on remote or recent memory, without impairing recognition performance itself. The findings reveal that parallel metamemory streams supervise recognition networks for remote and recent memory, without contributing to recognition itself.</p>

Superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex replay independently of the hippocampus
<p>The hippocampus is thought to initiate systems-wide mnemonic processes through the reactivation of previously acquired spatial and episodic memory traces, which can recruit the entorhinal cortex as a first stage of memory redistribution to other brain areas. Hippocampal reactivation occurs during sharp wave–ripples, in which synchronous network firing encodes sequences of places. We investigated the coordination of this replay by recording assembly activity simultaneously in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex. We found that entorhinal cell assemblies can replay trajectories independently of the hippocampus and sharp wave–ripples. This suggests that the hippocampus is not the sole initiator of spatial and episodic memory trace reactivation. Memory systems involved in these processes may include nonhierarchical, parallel components.</p>

Neural representations across species
<p>A plethora of studies in rodents have described spatially tuned neurons, including place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), suggesting a crucial role of the hippocampal formation in spatial navigation (<i>1</i>). Human studies have, in turn, shown that the hippocampal formation is involved in declarative memory (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es of facts and events) (<i>2</i>). What, then, is the function of the hippocampus? Is it involved in memory or in spatial navigation, or does it have a more general function that encompasses both? Several studies have shown that place cells remap, changing the location at which they respond, following geometrical changes in the environment, and that they can be modulated by nonspatial factors, according to the animals' specific tasks (<i>3</i>). These findings highlight the coding of cognitive components, challenging the notion that place cells represent an invariant spatial map. Although grid cells also realign with physical changes in the environment (<i>4</i>), the geometrical structure of their fields has been considered to provide a more invariant spatial representation. But do grid cells encode cognitive aspects as well? On pages 1443 and 1447 of this issue, Boccara <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) and Butler <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>), respectively, show that this is the case, providing compelling evidence that grid cells are modulated by reward location. Complementing these studies, Baraduc <i>et al.</i> (<i>7</i>) showed that variations in spatially tuned neurons in the monkey hippocampus are accompanied by a “schema” of the task. Together these studies provide insights on how neurons in the hippocampal formation go beyond purely spatial representations and are modulated by cognitive factors.</p>

PVT responses are scaled with stimulus intensity and modulated by changes in homeostatic state or behavioral context.

Causal role for inheritance of H3K27me3 in maintaining the OFF state of a <i>Drosophila</i> HOX gene

However, it remains uncertain whether modified nucleosomes play a causal role in transmitting such epigenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">memori</span></strong>es, as opposed to controlling or merely reflecting transcriptional states inherited by other means. Here, we provide in vivo evidence that H3K27 trimethylated nucleosomes, once established at a repressed <i>Drosophila</i> HOX gene, remain heritably associated with that gene and can carry the memory of the silenced state through multiple rounds of replication, even when the capacity to copy the H3K27me3 mark to newly incorporated nucleosomes is diminished or abolished. Hence, in this context, the inheritance of H3K27 trimethylation conveys epigenetic memory.</p>

Homer1a drives homeostatic scaling-down of excitatory synapses during sleep
<p>Sleep is an essential process that supports <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory by acting on synapses through poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Using biochemistry, proteomics, and imaging in mice, we find that during sleep, synapses undergo widespread alterations in composition and signaling, including weakening of synapses through removal and dephosphorylation of synaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors. These changes are driven by the immediate early gene Homer1a and signaling from group I metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1/5. Homer1a serves as a molecular integrator of arousal and sleep need via the wake- and sleep-promoting neuromodulators, noradrenaline and adenosine, respectively. Our data suggest that homeostatic scaling-down, a global form of synaptic plasticity, is active during sleep to remodel synapses and participates in the consolidation of contextual memory.</p>

Ultrastructural evidence for synaptic scaling across the wake/sleep cycle

However, energetic and informational considerations suggest that potentiation should occur primarily during wake, when animals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>, and depression should occur during sleep. We measured 6920 synapses in mouse motor and sensory cortices using three-dimensional electron microscopy. The axon-spine interface (ASI) decreased ~18% after sleep compared with wake. This decrease was proportional to ASI size, which is indicative of scaling. Scaling was selective, sparing synapses that were large and lacked recycling endosomes. Similar scaling occurred for spine head volume, suggesting a distinction between weaker, more plastic synapses (~80%) and stronger, more stable synapses. These results support the hypothesis that a core function of sleep is to renormalize overall synaptic strength increased by wake.</p>

Dopamine activity was phasically suppressed after distorted syllables, consistent with a worse-than-predicted outcome, and was phasically activated at the precise moment of the song when a predicted distortion did not occur, consistent with a better-than-predicted outcome. Error response magnitude depended on distortion probability. Thus, dopaminergic error signals can evaluate behaviors that are not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed for reward and are instead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed by matching performance outcomes to internal goals.</p>

Why does time seem to fly when we're having fun?
<p>Animals use the neurotransmitter dopamine to encode the relationship between their responses and reward. Reinforcement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing theory (<i>1</i>) successfully explains the role of phasic bursts of dopamine in terms of future reward maximization. Yet, dopamine clearly plays other roles in shaping behavior that have no obvious relationship to reinforcement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, including modulating the rate at which our subjective sense of time grows in real time. On page 1273 of this issue, Soares <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) closely examine the role of dopamine in mice performing a task in which they keep track of the time between two events and make decisions about this temporal duration. The results suggest the need to reassess the leading theory of dopamine function in timing—the dopamine clock hypothesis (<i>3</i>). They may also help explain empirical phenomena that challenge the reinforcement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing account of dopamine function.</p>

High-temperature pairing in a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas
<p>The nature of the normal phase of strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>ic systems is an outstanding question in quantum many-body physics. We used spatially resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure pairing energy of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>s across a wide range of temperatures and interaction strengths in a two-dimensional gas of ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>ic atoms. We observed many-body pairing at temperatures far above the critical temperature for superfluidity. In the strongly interacting regime, the pairing energy in the normal phase considerably exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing in this regime is driven by many-body correlations, rather than two-body physics. Our findings show that pairing correlations in strongly interacting two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>ic systems are remarkably robust against thermal fluctuations.</p>

Chiral Majorana fermion modes in a quantum anomalous Hall insulator–superconductor structure
<p>Majorana <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong> is a hypothetical particle that is its own antiparticle. We report transport measurements that suggest the existence of one-dimensional chiral Majorana <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong> modes in the hybrid system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film coupled with a superconductor. As the external magnetic field is swept, half-integer quantized conductance plateaus are observed at the locations of magnetization reversals, giving a distinct signature of the Majorana <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong> modes. This transport signature is reproducible over many magnetic field sweeps and appears at different temperatures. This finding may open up an avenue to control Majorana <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>s for implementing robust topological quantum computing.</p>

Multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles and superb mechanical behaviors of complex alloys
<p>Alloy design based on single–principal-element systems has approached its limit for performance enhancements. A substantial increase in strength up to gigapascal levels typically causes the premature failure of materials with reduced ductility. Here, we report a strategy to break this trade-off by controllably introducing high-density ductile multicomponent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intermetal</span></strong>lic nanoparticles (MCINPs) in complex alloy systems. Distinct from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intermetal</span></strong>lic-induced embrittlement under conventional wisdom, such MCINP-strengthened alloys exhibit superior strengths of 1.5 gigapascals and ductility as high as 50% in tension at ambient temperature. The plastic instability, a major concern for high-strength materials, can be completely eliminated by generating a distinctive multistage work-hardening behavior, resulting from pronounced dislocation activities and deformation-induced microbands. This MCINP strategy offers a paradigm to develop next-generation materials for structural applications.</p>

The role of electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional Dirac fermions
<p>The role of electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional Dirac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong> systems remains enigmatic. Using a combination of nonperturbative numerical and analytical techniques that incorporate both the contact and long-range parts of the Coulomb interaction, we identify the two previously discussed regimes: a Gross-Neveu transition to a strongly correlated Mott insulator and a semimetallic state with a logarithmically diverging Fermi velocity accurately described by the random phase approximation. We predict that experimental realizations of Dirac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>s span this crossover and that this determines whether the Fermi velocity is increased or decreased by interactions. We explain several long-standing mysteries, including why the observed Fermi velocity in graphene is consistently about 20% larger than values obtained from ab initio calculations and why graphene on different substrates shows different behaviors.</p>

Wallpaper fermions and the nonsymmorphic Dirac insulator
<p>Materials whose gapless surface states are protected by crystal symmetries include mirror topological crystalline insulators and nonsymmorphic hourglass insulators. There exists only a very limited set of possible surface crystal symmetries, captured by the 17 “wallpaper groups.” Here we show that a consideration of symmetry-allowed band degeneracies in the wallpaper groups can be used to understand previously described topological crystalline insulators and to predict phenomenologically distinct examples. In particular, the two wallpaper groups with multiple glide lines, <i>pgg</i> and <i>p</i>4<i>g</i>, allow for a topological insulating phase whose surface spectrum consists of only a single, fourfold-degenerate, true Dirac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>, representing an exception to a symmetry-enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>-doubling theorem. We theoretically predict the presence of this phase in Sr<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub> in space group 127 (<i>P</i>4<i>/mbm)</i>.</p>

Neutron scattering in the proximate quantum spin liquid α-RuCl<sub>3</sub>
<p>The Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL) is an exotic emergent state of matter exhibiting Majorana <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong> and gauge flux excitations. The magnetic insulator α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> is thought to realize a proximate KQSL. We used neutron scattering on single crystals of α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> to reconstruct dynamical correlations in energy-momentum space. We discovered highly unusual signals, including a column of scattering over a large energy interval around the Brillouin zone center, which is very stable with temperature. This finding is consistent with scattering from the Majorana excitations of a KQSL. Other, more delicate experimental features can be transparently associated with perturbations to an ideal model. Our results encourage further study of this prototypical material and may open a window into investigating emergent magnetic Majorana <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>s in correlated materials.</p>

Strongly correlated quantum walks with a 12-qubit superconducting processor
<p>Quantum walks are the quantum analogs of classical random walks, which allow for the simulation of large-scale quantum many-body systems and the realization of universal quantum computation without time-dependent control. We experimentally demonstrate quantum walks of one and two strongly correlated microwave photons in a one-dimensional array of 12 superconducting qubits with short-range interactions. First, in one-photon quantum walks, we observed the propagation of the density and correlation of the quasiparticle excitation of the superconducting qubit and quantum entanglement between qubit pairs. Second, when implementing two-photon quantum walks by exciting two superconducting qubits, we observed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>ization of strongly interacting photons from the measured time-dependent long-range anticorrelations, representing the antibunching of photons with attractive interactions. The demonstration of quantum walks on a quantum processor, using superconducting qubits as artificial atoms and tomographic readout, paves the way to quantum simulation of many-body phenomena and universal quantum computation.</p>

Spin transport in a Mott insulator of ultracold fermions
<p>Strongly correlated materials are expected to feature unconventional transport properties, such that charge, spin, and heat conduction are potentially independent probes of the dynamics. In contrast to charge transport, the measurement of spin transport in such materials is highly challenging. We observed spin conduction and diffusion in a system of ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>ic atoms that realizes the half-filled Fermi-Hubbard model. For strong interactions, spin diffusion is driven by super-exchange and doublon-hole–assisted tunneling, and strongly violates the quantum limit of charge diffusion. The technique developed in this work can be extended to finite doping, which can shed light on the complex interplay between spin and charge in the Hubbard model.</p>

Dirac electrons in a dodecagonal graphene quasicrystal
<p>Quantum states of quasiparticles in solids are dictated by symmetry. We have experimentally demonstrated quantum states of Dirac electrons in a two-dimensional quasicrystal without translational symmetry. A dodecagonal quasicrystalline order was realized by epitaxial growth of twisted bilayer graphene rotated exactly 30°. We grew the graphene quasicrystal up to a millimeter scale on a silicon carbide surface while maintaining the single rotation angle over an entire sample and successfully isolated the quasicrystal from a substrate, demonstrating its structural and chemical stability under ambient conditions. Multiple Dirac cones replicated with the 12-fold rotational symmetry were observed in angle-resolved photoemission spectra, which revealed anomalous strong interlayer coupling with quasi-periodicity. Our study provides a way to explore physical properties of relativistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>s with controllable quasicrystalline orders.</p>

Anomalous spin correlations and excitonic instability of interacting 2D Weyl fermions
<p>The Coulomb interaction in systems of quasi-relativistic massless electrons has an unscreened long-range component at variance with conventional correlated metals. We used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements to reveal unusual spin correlations of two-dimensional Weyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>s in an organic material, causing a divergent increase of the Korringa ratio by a factor of 1000 upon cooling, in marked contrast to conventional metallic behavior. Combined with model calculations, we show that this divergence stems from an interaction-driven velocity renormalization that almost exclusively suppresses zero-momentum spin fluctuations. At low temperatures, the NMR relaxation rate shows an unexpected increase; numerical analyses show that this increase corresponds to internode excitonic fluctuations, a precursor to a transition from massless to massive quasiparticles.</p>

Creation of a Bose-condensed gas of <sup>87</sup>Rb by laser cooling
<p>Protocols for attaining quantum degeneracy in atomic gases almost exclusively rely on evaporative cooling, a time-consuming final step associated with substantial atom loss. We demonstrate direct laser cooling of a gas of rubidium-87 (<sup>87</sup>Rb) atoms to quantum degeneracy. The method is fast and induces little atom loss. The atoms are trapped in a two-dimensional optical lattice that enables cycles of compression to increase the density, followed by Raman sideband cooling to decrease the temperature. From a starting number of 2000 atoms, 1400 atoms reach quantum degeneracy in 300 milliseconds, as confirmed by a bimodal velocity distribution. The method should be broadly applicable to many bosonic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>ic species and to systems where evaporative cooling is not possible.</p>

Spin-imbalance in a 2D Fermi-Hubbard system
<p>The interplay of strong interactions and magnetic fields gives rise to unusual forms of superconductivity and magnetism in quantum many-body systems. Here, we present an experimental study of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model—a paradigm for strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>s on a lattice—in the presence of a Zeeman field and varying doping. Using site-resolved measurements, we revealed anisotropic antiferromagnetic correlations, a precursor to long-range canted order. We observed nonmonotonic behavior of the local polarization with doping for strong interactions, which we attribute to the evolution from an antiferromagnetic insulator to a metallic phase. Our results pave the way to experimentally mapping the low-temperature phase diagram of the Fermi-Hubbard model as a function of both doping and spin polarization, for which many open questions remain.</p>

Second-scale nuclear spin coherence time of ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K molecules
<p>Coherence, the stability of the relative phase between quantum states, is central to quantum mechanics and its applications. For ultracold dipolar molecules at sub-microkelvin temperatures, internal states with robust coherence are predicted to offer rich prospects for quantum many-body physics and quantum information processing. We report the observation of stable coherence between nuclear spin states of ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>ic sodium-potassium (NaK) molecules in the singlet rovibrational ground state. Ramsey spectroscopy reveals coherence times on the scale of 1 second; this enables high-resolution spectroscopy of the molecular gas. Collisional shifts are shown to be absent down to the 100-millihertz level. This work opens the door to the use of molecules as a versatile quantum memory and for precision measurements on dipolar quantum matter.</p>

An on/off Berry phase switch in circular graphene resonators
<p>The phase of a quantum state may not return to its original value after the system’s parameters cycle around a closed path; instead, the wave function may acquire a measurable phase difference called the Berry phase. Berry phases typically have been accessed through interference experiments. Here, we demonstrate an unusual Berry phase–induced spectroscopic feature: a sudden and large increase in the energy of angular-momentum states in circular graphene p-n junction resonators when a relatively small critical magnetic field is reached. This behavior results from turning on a π Berry phase associated with the topological properties of Dirac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>s in graphene. The Berry phase can be switched on and off with small magnetic field changes on the order of 10 millitesla, potentially enabling a variety of optoelectronic graphene device applications.</p>

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation
<p>The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear optical responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear optical processes is high-harmonic generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron motion induced by an intense light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in graphene excited by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser excitation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>s.</p>

Biaxially strained PtPb/Pt core/shell nanoplate boosts oxygen reduction catalysis
<p>Compressive surface strains have been necessary to boost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in core/shell M/platinum (Pt) catalysts (where M can be nickel, cobalt, or iron). We report on a class of platinum-lead/platinum (PtPb/Pt) core/shell nanoplate catalysts that exhibit large biaxial strains. The stable Pt (110) facets of the nanoplates have high ORR specific and mass activities that reach 7.8 milliampere (mA) per centimeter squared and 4.3 ampere per milligram of platinum at 0.9 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the edge-Pt and top (bottom)–Pt (110) facets undergo large tensile strains that help optimize the Pt-O bond strength. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intermetal</span></strong>lic core and uniform four layers of Pt shell of the PtPb/Pt nanoplates appear to underlie the high endurance of these catalysts, which can undergo 50,000 voltage cycles with negligible activity decay and no apparent structure and composition changes.</p>

Ultrafast many-body interferometry of impurities coupled to a Fermi sea
<p>The fastest possible collective response of a quantum many-body system is related to its excitations at the highest possible energy. In condensed matter systems, the time scale for such “ultrafast” processes is typically set by the Fermi energy. Taking advantage of fast and precise control of interactions between ultracold atoms, we observed nonequilibrium dynamics of impurities coupled to an atomic Fermi sea. Our interferometric measurements track the nonperturbative quantum evolution of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fermion</span></strong>ic many-body system, revealing in real time the formation dynamics of quasi-particles and the quantum interference between attractive and repulsive states throughout the full depth of the Fermi sea. Ultrafast time-domain methods applied to strongly interacting quantum gases enable the study of the dynamics of quantum matter under extreme nonequilibrium conditions.</p>

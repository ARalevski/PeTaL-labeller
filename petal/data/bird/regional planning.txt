Airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy to map forest trait diversity and guide conservation
<p>Functional biogeography may bridge a gap between field-based biodiversity information and satellite-based Earth system studies, thereby supporting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>s to protect more species and their contributions to ecosystem functioning. We used airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy with environmental modeling to derive large-scale, multivariate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> canopy functional trait maps of the Peruvian Andes-to-Amazon biodiversity hotspot. Seven mapped canopy traits revealed functional variation in a geospatial pattern explained by geology, topography, hydrology, and climate. Clustering of canopy traits yielded a map of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> beta functional diversity for land-use analysis. Up to 53% of each mapped, functionally distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> presents an opportunity for new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation action. Mapping functional diversity advances our understanding of the biosphere to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>e more biodiversity in the face of land use and climate change.</p>

Giberellic Acid-Stimulated Transcript Proteins Evolved through Successive Conjugation of Novel Motifs and Their Subfunctionalization
<p><i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript</i> (<i>GAST</i>)-like genes encode small polypeptides, some of which have been implicated in diverse biological processes regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t growth and development. However, the occurrence of GASTs among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, their protein structures, and the mechanisms by which they evolved remain elusive. Here, using a customized workflow, we report genes encoding GAST proteins, identify novel motifs and evolutionary patterns contributing to the subfunctionalization of GAST domains, and explore functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation across diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t groups. We show that <i>GAST</i>-like sequences evolved initially in the vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i>, after the divergence from bryophytes, and later emerged in gymnosperms and angiosperms. GASTs in angiosperms are characterized by four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed novel motifs; however, relatively fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed motifs exist in pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GAST-Cysteine Rich1 motif evolved early in the <i>S. moellendorffii</i> GAST, which further acquired subfunctionalization through successive conjugation of other motifs and remained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, as supported by their collinearity. Functional characterization of two orthologs from the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated Arabidopsis 10</i>) and the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-Related 9</i>) suggests hormonal regulation, novel roles in seed germination, and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation among diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t groups. Computational modeling predicts that these <i>GAST</i> genes are regulated by several factors, including the phytohormones gibberellin and abscisic acid, through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed cis-motifs present in their promoters, and that they might act as signaling molecules in a complex feedback loop. Thus, our study identifies <i>GAST</i>s and their encoded proteins, uncovers their structure, novel motifs, and evolutionary pattern among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, and suggests their functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation.</p>

Positive biodiversity-productivity relationship predominant in global forests
<p>The biodiversity-productivity relationship (BPR) is foundational to our understanding of the global extinction crisis and its impacts on ecosystem functioning. Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of biodiversity. Using ground-sourced data from 777,126 permanent plots, spanning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> productivity worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> productivity alone—US$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our estimation—is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation. This highlights the need for a worldwide reassessment of biodiversity values, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> manag</span></strong>ement strategies, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation priorities.</p>

A 90,000-year record of Afromontane forest responses to climate change
<p>Pollen records from African highlands are scarce; hence, the paleoecology of the Afromontane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> and its responses to glacial cycles are poorly known. Lake Bambili (Cameroon) provides a record of vegetation changes in the tropical mountains of Africa over the past 90,000 years, with high temporal resolution. Pollen data and biome reconstructions show a diverging response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s to climate changes; the upper tree line was extremely unstable, shifting substantially in response to glacial-interglacial climate alternation, whereas the transition between the montane and lowland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s remained remarkably stable.

Classifying drivers of global forest loss
<p>Global maps of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss depict the scale and magnitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent conversion (i.e., de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation) from temporary loss from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ry or wildfire. Using satellite imagery, we developed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27% of global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss can be attributed to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ry (26%), shifting agriculture (24%), and wildfire (23%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation has not declined. To end de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of conversion from supply chains each year.</p>

Ravens parallel great apes in flexible planning for tool-use and bartering
<p>The ability to flexibly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong> for events outside of the current sensory scope is at the core of being human and is crucial to our everyday lives and society.

The extent of forest in dryland biomes

Arabidopsis β-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine β-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized enzyme reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of amino acids in the active site of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic kinetics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light scattering, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a monomer. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were mapped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed surface away from the active site that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding site. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure. Expression analysis indicated that BAM2 is more closely coexpressed with other starch degradation enzymes than any other BAM, suggesting that BAM2 may play an important role in starch degradation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts.</p>

Genomic Basis of Adaptive Evolution: The Survival of Amur Ide (<i>Leuciscu</i>s <i>waleckii</i>) in an Extremely Alkaline Environment
<p>The Amur ide (<i>Leuciscus waleckii</i>) is a cyprinid fish that is widely distributed in Northeast Asia. The Lake Dali Nur population inhabits one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth, with an alkalinity up to 50 mmol/L (pH 9.6), thus providing an exceptional model with which to characterize the mechanisms of genomic evolution underlying adaptation to extreme environments. Here, we developed the reference genome assembly for <i>L. waleckii</i> from Lake Dali Nur. Intriguingly, we identified unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> genome. We also identified expansions in genes encoding egg coat proteins and natriuretic peptide receptors, possibly underlying the adaptation to extreme environmental stress. We further sequenced the genomes of 10 additional individuals from freshwater and 18 from Lake Dali Nur populations, and we detected a total of 7.6 million SNPs from both populations. In a genome scan and comparison of these two populations, we identified a set of genomic regions under selective sweeps that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong> genes involved in ion homoeostasis, acid-base regulation, unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species elimination, and urea excretion. Our findings provide comprehensive insight into the genomic mechanisms of teleost fish that underlie their adaptation to extreme alkaline environments.</p>

Loss and Gain of Human Acidic Mammalian Chitinase Activity by Nonsynonymous SNPs
<p>Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is implicated in asthma, allergic inflammation, and food processing. Little is known about genetic and evolutional regulation of chitinolytic activity of AMCase. Here, we relate human AMCase polymorphisms to the mouse AMCase, and show that the highly active variants encoded by nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are consistent with the mouse AMCase sequence. The chitinolytic activity of the recombinant human AMCase was significantly lower than that of the mouse counterpart. By creating mouse-human chimeric AMCase protein we found that the presence of the N-terminal region of human AMCase containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed active site residues reduced the enzymatic activity of the molecule. We were able to significantly increase the activity of human AMCase by amino acid substitutions encoded by nsSNPs (N45, D47, and R61) with those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in the mouse homologue (D45, N47, and M61). For abolition of the mouse AMCase activity, introduction of M61R mutation was sufficient. M61 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in most of primates other than human and orangutan as well as in other mammals. Orangutan has I61 substitution, which also markedly reduced the activity of the mouse AMCase, indicating that the M61 is a crucial residue for the chitinolytic activity. Altogether, our data suggest that human AMCase has lost its chitinolytic activity by integration of nsSNPs during evolution and that the enzyme can be reactivated by introducing amino acids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in the mouse counterpart.</p>

Winter drought impairs xylem phenology, anatomy and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine forests
<p>Continental Mediterranean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s face drought but also cold spells and both climate extremes can impair the resilience capacity of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s. Climate warming could amplify the negative effects of cold spells by inducing premature dehardening. Here we capitalize on a winter drought-induced dieback triggered by a cold spell which occurred in December 2001 affecting Scots pine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s in eastern Spain. We assessed post-dieback recovery by quantifying and comparing radial growth and xylem anatomy of non-declining (ND, crown cover >50%) and declining (D, crown cover ≤50%) trees in two sites (VP, Villarroya de los Pinares; TO, Torrijas). We also characterized xylogenesis in both sites and aboveground productivity in site VP. Dieback caused legacy effects since needle loss, a 60% reduction in litter fall and radial-growth decline characterized D-trees 3 years after dieback symptoms started appearing in spring 2002. D-trees formed collapsed tracheids in the 2002-ring, particularly in the most affected VP site where xylogenesis differences between ND and D trees were most noticeable. The lower growth rates of D-trees were caused by a shorter duration of their major xylogenesis phases. In site VP the radial-enlargement and wall-thickening of tracheids were significantly reduced in D-trees as compared to ND-trees because these xylogenesis phases tended to start earlier and end later in ND-trees. Gompertz models fitted to tracheid production predicted that maximum growth rates occurred 11–12 days earlier in ND than in D-trees. The formation of radially-enlarging tracheids was enhanced by longer days in both study sites and also by wetter conditions in the driest TO site, but xylogenesis sensitivity to climate was reduced in D-trees. Winter-drought dieback impairs xylem anatomy and phenology, aboveground productivity, xylogenesis and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine populations. Affected stands show a costly post-dieback recovery challenging their resilience ability.</p>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> manag</span></strong>ement decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

The pseudokinase domains of guanylyl cyclase–A and –B allosterically increase the affinity of their catalytic domains for substrate
<p>Natriuretic peptides regulate multiple physiologic systems by activating transmembrane receptors containing intracellular guanylyl cyclase domains, such as GC-A and GC-B, also known as Npr1 and Npr2, respectively. Both enzymes contain an intracellular, phosphorylated pseudokinase domain (PKD) critical for activation of the C-terminal cGMP-synthesizing guanylyl cyclase domain. Because ATP allosterically activates GC-A and GC-B, we investigated how ATP binding to the PKD influenced guanylyl cyclase activity. Molecular modeling indicated that all the residues of the ATP-binding site of the prototypical kinase PKA, except the catalytic aspartate, are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in the PKDs of GC-A and GC-B. Kinase-inactivating alanine substitutions for the invariant lysine in subdomain II or the aspartate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-B failed to decrease enzyme phosphate content, consistent with the PKDs lacking kinase activity. In contrast, both mutations reduced enzyme activation by blocking the ability of ATP to decrease the Michaelis constant without affecting peptide-dependent activation. The analogous lysine-to-alanine substitution in a glutamate-substituted phosphomimetic mutant form of GC-B also reduced enzyme activity, consistent with ATP stimulating guanylyl cyclase activity through an allosteric, phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Mutations designed to rigidify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed regulatory or catalytic spines within the PKDs increased guanylyl cyclase activity, increased sensitivity to natriuretic peptide, or reduced the Michaelis constant in the absence of ATP, consistent with ATP binding stabilizing the PKD in a conformation analogous to that of catalytically active kinases. We conclude that allosteric mechanisms evolutionarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in the PKDs promote the catalytic activation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases.</p>

Elevated trawling inside protected areas undermines conservation outcomes in a global fishing hot spot
<p>Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly used as a primary tool to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>e biodiversity. This is particularly relevant in heavily exploited fisheries hot spots such as Europe, where MPAs now cover 29% of territorial waters, with unknown effects on fishing pressure and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation outcomes. We investigated industrial trawl fishing and sensitive indicator species in and around 727 MPAs designated by the European Union. We found that 59% of MPAs are commercially trawled, and average trawling intensity across MPAs is at least 1.4-fold higher as compared with nonprotected areas. Abundance of sensitive species (sharks, rays, and skates) decreased by 69% in heavily trawled areas. The widespread industrial exploitation of MPAs undermines global biodiversity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation targets, elevating recent concerns about growing human pressures on protected areas worldwide.</p>

Tropical forests are a net carbon source based on aboveground measurements of gain and loss
<p>The carbon balance of tropical ecosystems remains uncertain, with top-down atmospheric studies suggesting an overall sink and bottom-up ecological approaches indicating a modest net source. Here we use 12 years (2003 to 2014) of MODIS pantropical satellite data to quantify net annual changes in the aboveground carbon density of tropical woody live vegetation, providing direct, measurement-based evidence that the world’s tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s are a net carbon source of 425.2<bold> </bold>± 92.0 teragrams of carbon per year (Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). This net release of carbon consists of losses of 861.7 ± 80.2 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup> and gains of 436.5 ± 31.0 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>. Gains result from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> growth; losses result from de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation and from reductions in carbon density within standing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s (degradation or disturbance), with the latter accounting for 68.9% of overall losses.</p>

Cash for carbon: A randomized trial of payments for ecosystem services to reduce deforestation

Redox stratification of an ancient lake in Gale crater, Mars
<p>In 2012, NASA’s Curiosity rover landed on Mars to assess its potential as a habitat for past life and investigate the paleoclimate record preserved by sedimentary rocks inside the ~150-kilometer-diameter Gale impact crater.

We present evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong> redox stratification, established by depth-dependent variations in atmospheric oxidant and dissolved-solute concentrations. Paleoclimate proxy data indicate that a transition from colder to warmer climate conditions is preserved in the stratigraphy.

The Transcriptional Coactivator ADA2b Recruits a Structural Maintenance Protein to Double-Strand Breaks during DNA Repair in Plants
<p>DNA damage occurs in all cells and can hinder chromosome stability and cell viability. Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes5/6 (SMC5/6) is a protein complex that functions as an evolutionarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed chromosomal ATPase critical for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, the mechanisms regulating this complex in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts are poorly understood. Here, we identified the transcriptional coactivator ALTERATION/DEFICIENCY IN ACTIVATION2B (ADA2b) as an interactor of SMC5 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). ADA2b is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed component of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase complex, which functions in transcriptional regulation. Characterization of mutant and knockdown Arabidopsis lines showed that disruption of either <i>SMC5</i> or <i>ADA2b</i> resulted in enhanced DNA damage. Both SMC5 and ADA2b were associated with γ-H2AX, a marker of DSBs, and the recruitment of SMC5 onto DSBs was dependent on ADA2b. In addition, overexpression of <i>SMC5</i> in the <i>ada2b</i> mutant background stimulated cell death. Collectively, our results show that the interaction between ADA2b and SMC5 mediates DNA repair in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t cells, suggesting a functional association between these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed proteins and further elucidating mechanisms of DNA damage repair in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts.</p>

Loss of LOFSEP Transcription Factor Function Converts Spikelet to Leaf-Like Structures in Rice
<p><i>SEPALLATA</i> (<i>SEP</i>)-like genes, which encode a subfamily of MADS-box transcription factors, are essential for specifying floral organ and meristem identity in angiosperms. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) has five <i>SEP</i>-like genes with partial redundancy and overlapping expression domains, yet their functions and evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation are only partially known. Here, we describe the biological role of one of the <i>SEP</i> genes of rice, <i>OsMADS5</i>, in redundantly controlling spikelet morphogenesis. <i>OsMADS5</i> belongs to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed <i>LOFSEP</i> subgroup along with <i>OsMADS1</i> and <i>OsMADS34</i>. <i>OsMADS5</i> was expressed strongly across a broad range of reproductive stages and tissues. No obvious phenotype was observed in the <i>osmads5</i> single mutants when compared with the wild type, which was largely due to the functional redundancy among the three <i>LOFSEP</i> genes. Genetic and molecular analyses demonstrated that <i>OsMADS1</i>, <i>OsMADS5</i>, and <i>OsMADS34</i> together regulate floral meristem determinacy and specify the identities of spikelet organs by positively regulating the other MADS-box floral homeotic genes. Experiments conducted in yeast also suggested that OsMADS1, OsMADS5, and OsMADS34 form protein-protein interactions with other MADS-box floral homeotic members, which seems to be a typical, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed feature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t SEP proteins.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

A Conserved cis-Regulatory Module Determines Germline Fate through Activation of the Transcription Factor DUO1 Promoter
<p>The development of the male germline within pollen relies upon the activation of numerous target genes by the transcription factor DUO POLLEN1 (DUO1). The expression of DUO1 is restricted to the male germline and is first detected shortly after the asymmetric division that segregates the germ cell lineage. Transcriptional regulation is critical in controlling DUO1 expression, since transcriptional and translational fusions show similar expression patterns. Here, we identify key promoter sequences required for the germline-specific regulation of <i>DUO1</i> transcription. Combining promoter deletion analyses with phylogenetic footprinting in eudicots and in Arabidopsis accessions, we identify a cis-regulatory module, <i>Regulatory region of DUO1</i> (<i>ROD1</i>), which replicates the expression pattern of <i>DUO1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We show that <i>ROD1</i> from the legume <i>Medicago truncatula</i> directs male germline-specific expression in Arabidopsis, demonstrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of DUO1 regulation among eudicots. <i>ROD1</i> contains several short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed cis-regulatory elements, including three copies of the motif DNGTGGV, required for germline expression and tandem repeats of the motif YAACYGY, which enhance <i>DUO1</i> transcription in a positive feedback loop. We conclude that a cis-regulatory module <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in eudicots directs the spatial and temporal expression of the transcription factor DUO1 to specify male germline fate and sperm cell differentiation.</p>

The Developmental Brain Gene <i>NPAS3</i> Contains the Largest Number of Accelerated Regulatory Sequences in the Human Genome
<p>To identify the evolutionary genetic novelties that contributed to shape human-specific traits such as the use of a complex language, long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ning and exceptional learning abilities is one of the ultimate frontiers of modern biology. Evolutionary signatures of functional shifts could be detected by comparing noncoding regions that are highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed across mammals or primates and rapidly accumulated nucleotide substitutions only in the lineage leading to humans. As gene loci densely populated with human-accelerated elements (HAEs) are more likely to have contributed to human-specific novelties, we sought to identify the transcriptional units and genomic 1 Mb intervals of the entire human genome carrying the highest number of HAEs. To this end, we took advantage of four available data sets of human genomic accelerated regions obtained through different comparisons and algorithms and performed a meta-analysis of the combined data. We found that the brain developmental transcription factor <i>neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3</i> (<i>NPAS3</i>) contains the largest cluster of noncoding-accelerated regions in the human genome with up to 14 elements that are highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in mammals, including primates, but carry human-specific nucleotide substitutions. We then tested the ability of the 14 HAEs identified at the <i>NPAS3</i> locus to act as transcriptional regulatory sequences in a reporter expression assay performed in transgenic zebrafish. We found that 11 out of the 14 HAEs present in <i>NPAS3</i> act as transcriptional enhancers during development, particularly within the nervous system. As <i>NPAS3</i> is known to play a crucial role during mammalian brain development, our results indicate that the high density of HAEs present in the human <i>NPAS3</i> locus could have modified the spatiotemporal expression pattern of <i>NPAS3</i> in the developing human brain and, therefore, contributed to human brain evolution.</p>

Complete measurement of helicity and its dynamics in vortex tubes
<p>Helicity, a topological measure of the intertwining of vortices in a fluid flow, is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed quantity in inviscid fluids but can be dissipated by viscosity in real flows. Despite its relevance across a range of flows, helicity in real fluids remains poorly understood because the entire quantity is challenging to measure.

For helical vortices that are stretched or compressed by a second vortex, we found <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of total helicity. For an isolated helical vortex, we observed evolution toward and maintenance of a constant helicity state after the dissipation of twist helicity by viscosity.

Ratchet-like polypeptide translocation mechanism of the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp104
<p>Hsp100 polypeptide translocases are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed members of the AAA+ family (adenosine triphosphatases associated with diverse cellular activities) that maintain proteostasis by unfolding aberrant and toxic proteins for refolding or proteolytic degradation. The Hsp104 disaggregase from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> solubilizes stress-induced amorphous aggregates and amyloids. The structural basis for substrate recognition and translocation is unknown. Using a model substrate (casein), we report cryo–electron microscopy structures at near-atomic resolution of Hsp104 in different translocation states. Substrate interactions are mediated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed, pore-loop tyrosines that contact an 80-angstrom-long unfolded polypeptide along the axial channel. Two protomers undergo a ratchet-like conformational change that advances pore loop–substrate interactions by two amino acids. These changes are coupled to activation of specific nucleotide hydrolysis sites and, when transmitted around the hexamer, reveal a processive rotary translocation mechanism and substrate-responsive flexibility during Hsp104-catalyzed disaggregation.</p>

A “Trojan horse” bispecific-antibody strategy for broad protection against ebolaviruses

Bispecific antibodies, but not parent mAbs, neutralized all known ebolaviruses by coopting viral particles themselves for endosomal delivery and conferred postexposure protection against multiple ebolaviruses in mice.

Evolution of Cold Acclimation and Its Role in Niche Transition in the Temperate Grass Subfamily Pooideae
<p>The grass subfamily Pooideae dominates the grass floras in cold temperate regions and has evolved complex physiological adaptations to cope with extreme environmental conditions like frost, winter, and seasonality. One such adaptation is cold acclimation, wherein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts increase their frost tolerance in response to gradually falling temperatures and shorter days in the autumn. However, understanding how complex traits like cold acclimation evolve remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigated the evolution of cold acclimation in Pooideae and found that a phylogenetically diverse set of Pooideae species displayed cold acclimation capacity. However, comparing differential gene expression after cold treatment in transcriptomes of five phylogenetically diverse species revealed widespread species-specific responses of genes with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed sequences. Furthermore, we studied the correlation between gene family size and number of cold-responsive genes as well as between selection pressure on coding sequences of genes and their cold responsiveness. We saw evidence of protein-coding and regulatory sequence evolution as well as the origin of novel genes and functions contributing toward evolution of a cold response in Pooideae. Our results reflect that selection pressure resulting from global cooling must have acted on already diverged lineages. Nevertheless, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of cold-induced gene expression of certain genes indicates that the Pooideae ancestor may have possessed some molecular machinery to mitigate cold stress. Evolution of adaptations to seasonally cold climates is regarded as particularly difficult. How Pooideae evolved to transition from tropical to temperate biomes sheds light on how complex traits evolve in the light of climate changes.</p>

RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2-Mediated Transcriptional Repression Regulates Vegetative and Reproductive Architecture

Analysis of single recessive mutations in <i>rel2</i> revealed an array of vegetative and reproductive phenotypes, many related to defects in meristem initiation and maintenance. To better understand how REL2-mediated transcriptional complexes relate to <i>rel2</i> phenotypes, we performed protein interaction assays and transcriptional profiling of mutant inflorescences, leading to the identification of different maize transcription factors and regulatory pathways that employ REL2 repression to control traits directly impacting maize yields. In addition, we used our REL2 interaction data to catalog <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed repression motifs present on REL2 interactors and showed that two of these, RLFGV- and DLN-type motifs, interact with the C-terminal WD40 domain of REL2 rather than the N terminus, which is known to bind LxLxL EAR motifs. These findings establish that the WD40 domain of TPL family proteins is an independent protein interaction surface that may work together with the N-terminal domain to allow the formation of large macromolecular complexes of functionally related transcription factors.</p>

Characterization of Imprinted Genes in Rice Reveals Conservation of Regulation and Imprinting with Other Plant Species
<p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon by which certain genes display differential expression in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner. Hundreds of imprinted genes have been identified from several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t species. Here, we identified, with a high level of confidence, 208 imprinted gene candidates from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Imprinted genes of rice showed limited association with the transposable elements, which contrasts with findings from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Generally, imprinting in rice is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed within a species, but intraspecific variation also was detected. The imprinted rice genes do not show signatures of selection, which suggests that domestication has had a limited evolutionary consequence on genomic imprinting. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of imprinting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts is limited, we show that some loci are imprinted in several different species. Moreover, our results suggest that different types of epigenetic regulation can be established either before or after fertilization. Imprinted 24-nucleotide small RNAs and their neighboring genes tend to express alleles from different parents. This association was not observed between 21-nucleotide small RNAs and their neighboring genes. Together, our findings suggest that the regulation of imprinting can be diverse, and genomic imprinting has evolutionary and biological significance.</p>

Lipopolysaccharides Trigger Two Successive Bursts of Reactive Oxygen Species at Distinct Cellular Locations
<p>Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are major components of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and are an important microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) that triggers immune responses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts and animals. A previous genetic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) identified LIPOOLIGOSACCHARIDE-SPECIFIC REDUCED ELICITATION (LORE), a B-type lectin <i>S</i>-domain receptor kinase, as a sensor of LPS. However, the LPS-activated LORE signaling pathway and associated immune responses remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that LPS trigger biphasic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Arabidopsis. The first transient ROS burst was similar to that induced by another MAMP, flagellin, whereas the second long-lasting burst was induced only by LPS. The LPS-triggered second ROS burst was found to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t species. Microscopic observation of the generation of ROS revealed that the LPS-triggered second ROS burst was largely associated with chloroplasts, and functional chloroplasts were indispensable for this response. The lipid A moiety, the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed portion of LPS, appears to be responsible for the second ROS burst. Surprisingly, the LPS- and lipid A-triggered second ROS burst was only partially dependent on LORE. Together, our findings provide insight on the LPS-triggered ROS production and the associated signaling pathway.</p>

Pausing of Chloroplast Ribosomes Is Induced by Multiple Features and Is Linked to the Assembly of Photosynthetic Complexes<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many mRNAs contain pause sites that briefly interrupt the progress of translation. Specific features that induce ribosome pausing have been described; however, their individual contributions to pause-site formation, and the overall biological significance of ribosome pausing, remain largely unclear. We have taken advantage of the compact genome of chloroplasts to carry out a plastid genome-wide survey of pause sites, as a basis for studying the impact of pausing on posttranslational processes. Based on ribosomal profiling of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) chloroplast mRNAs, we demonstrate that a combination of factors—mRNA secondary structure, internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and positively charged amino acids in the nascent peptide chain—explains 95% of the major pause sites on plastid mRNAs, whereas codon usage has little impact. The distribution of the pause sites is nonrandom and conforms to distinct patterns in the vicinity of sequences coding for transmembrane domains, which depend on their orientation within the membrane as well as being next to sequences coding for cofactor binding sites. We found strong indications that the mechanisms causing ribosomal pausing and at least some of the ribosomes pause sites are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed between distantly related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t species. In addition, the positions of features that cause pausing are well <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in photoautotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, but less so in their nonphotosynthetic, parasitic relatives, implying that the synthesis and assembly of photosynthetic multiprotein complexes requires localized ribosome pausing.</p>

Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t that is well adapted to partial flooding. Rice stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t gets flooded, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root system upon flooding. AR growth is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root system in flooded rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and growth of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of growth direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120° in the dark and downward at 54° in the light. The upward growth direction is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties, suggestive of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed trait in rice. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward growth by about 10°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative phototropism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR system architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile phototropism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the phototropin-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of rice ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward growth) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward growth).</p>

In turn, some animal viruses are able to escape and modulate autophagy for enhanced pathogenicity. Whether host autophagic responses and viral countermeasures play similar roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t-virus interactions is not well understood. Here, we have identified selective autophagy as antiviral pathway during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t infection with turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), a positive-stranded RNA potyvirus. We show that the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 suppresses viral accumulation by targeting the viral RNA silencing suppressor helper-component proteinase (HCpro), presumably in association with virus-induced RNA granules. Intriguingly, TuMV seems to antagonize NBR1-dependent autophagy during infection by the activity of distinct viral proteins, thereby limiting its antiviral capacity. We also found that NBR1-independent bulk autophagy prevents premature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t death, thus extending the lifespan of virus reservoirs and particle production. Together, our study highlights a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed role of selective autophagy in antiviral immunity and suggests the evolvement of viral protein functions to inhibit autophagy processes, despite a potential trade-off in host survival.</p>

Selinene Volatiles Are Essential Precursors for Maize Defense Promoting Fungal Pathogen Resistance
<p>To ensure food security, maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a model crop for understanding useful traits underlying stress resistance. In contrast to foliar biochemicals, root defenses limiting the spread of disease remain poorly described. To better understand belowground defenses in the field, we performed root metabolomic profiling and uncovered unexpectedly high levels of the sesquiterpene volatile β-selinene and the corresponding nonvolatile antibiotic derivative β-costic acid. The application of metabolite-based quantitative trait locus mapping using biparental populations, genome-wide association studies, and near-isogenic lines enabled the identification of terpene synthase21 (<i>ZmTps21</i>) on chromosome 9 as a β-costic acid pathway candidate gene. Numerous closely examined β-costic acid-deficient inbred lines were found to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong> <i>Zmtps21</i> pseudogenes lacking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed motifs required for farnesyl diphosphate cyclase activity. For biochemical validation, a full-length <i>ZmTps21</i> was cloned, heterologously expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and demonstrated to cyclize farnesyl diphosphate, yielding β-selinene as the dominant product. Consistent with microbial defense pathways, <i>ZmTps21</i> transcripts strongly accumulate following fungal elicitation. Challenged field roots containing functional <i>ZmTps21</i> alleles displayed β-costic acid levels over 100 μg g<sup>−1</sup> fresh weight, greatly exceeding in vitro concentrations required to inhibit the growth of five different fungal pathogens and rootworm larvae (<i>Diabrotica balteata</i>). In vivo disease resistance assays, using <i>ZmTps21</i> and <i>Zmtps21</i> near-isogenic lines, further support the endogenous antifungal role of selinene-derived metabolites. Involved in the biosynthesis of nonvolatile antibiotics, <i>ZmTps21</i> exists as a useful gene for germplasm improvement programs targeting optimized biotic stress resistance.</p>

Monophyletic Origin and Evolution of the Largest Crucifer Genomes
<p>Clade E, or the <i>Hesperis</i> clade, is one of the major Brassicaceae (Crucifereae) clades, comprising some 48 genera and 351 species classified into seven tribes and is distributed predominantly across arid and montane regions of Asia. Several taxa have socioeconomic significance, being important ornamental but also weedy and invasive species. From the comparative genomic perspective, the clade is noteworthy as it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>s species with the largest crucifer genomes but low numbers of chromosomes (<i>n</i> = 5–7). By applying comparative cytogenetic analysis and whole-chloroplast phylogenetics, we constructed, to our knowledge, the first partial and complete cytogenetic maps for selected representatives of clade E tribes and investigated their relationships in a family-wide context. The <i>Hesperis</i> clade is a well-supported monophyletic lineage comprising seven tribes: Anchonieae, Buniadeae, Chorisporeae, Dontostemoneae, Euclidieae, Hesperideae, and Shehbazieae. The clade diverged from other Brassicaceae crown-group clades during the Oligocene, followed by subsequent Miocene tribal diversifications in central/southwestern Asia. The inferred ancestral karyotype of clade E (CEK; <i>n</i> = 7) originated from an older <i>n</i> = 8 genome, which also was the purported progenitor of tribe Arabideae (KAA genome). In most taxa of clade E, the seven linkage groups of CEK either remained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed (Chorisporeae) or were reshuffled by chromosomal translocations (Euclidieae). In 50% of Anchonieae and Hesperideae species, the CEK genome has undergone descending dysploidy toward <i>n</i> = 6 (−5). These genomic data elucidate early genome evolution in Brassicaceae and pave the way for future whole-genome sequencing and assembly efforts in this as yet genomically neglected group of crucifer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts.</p>

Six-Rowed Spike3 (VRS3) Is a Histone Demethylase That Controls Lateral Spikelet Development in Barley
<p>The complex nature of crop genomes has long prohibited the efficient isolation of agronomically relevant genes. However, recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies provide new ways to accelerate fine-mapping and gene isolation in crops. We used RNA sequencing of allelic <i>six-rowed spike3</i> (<i>vrs3</i>) mutants with altered spikelet development for gene identification and functional analysis in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Variant calling in two allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed that <i>VRS3</i> encodes a putative histone Lys demethylase with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed zinc finger and Jumonji C and N domain. Sanger sequencing of this candidate gene in independent allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed a series of mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed domains, thus confirming our candidate as the <i>VRS3</i> gene and suggesting that the row type in barley is determined epigenetically. Global transcriptional profiling in developing shoot apical meristems of <i>vrs3</i> suggested that VRS3 acts as a transcriptional activator of the row-type genes <i>VRS1</i> (<i>Hv.HOMEOBOX1</i>) and <i>INTERMEDIUM-C</i> (<i>INT-C</i>; <i>Hv.TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>). Comparative transcriptome analysis of the row-type mutants <i>vrs3</i>, <i>vrs4</i> (<i>Hv.RAMOSA2</i>), and <i>int-c</i> confirmed that all three genes act as transcriptional activators of <i>VRS1</i> and quantitative variation in the expression levels of <i>VRS1</i> in these mutants correlated with differences in the number of developed lateral spikelets. The identification of genes and pathways affecting seed number in small grain cereals will enable to further unravel the transcriptional networks controlling this important yield component.</p>

LNK1 and LNK2 Corepressors Interact with the MYB3 Transcription Factor in Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Subgroup 4 of R2R3-MYB transcription factors consists of four members, MYB3, MYB4, MYB7, and MYB32, which possess the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed EAR repression motif (pdLHLD/LLxiG/S) in their C termini. Here, we show that MYB3 is a newly identified repressor in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. However, the repression mechanism of MYB3 is completely different from MYB4, MYB7, and MYB32. Yeast two-hybrid screening using MYB3 as a bait isolates NIGHT LIGHT-INDUCIBLE AND CLOCK-REGULATED1 (LNK1) and LNK2, members of a small family of four LNK proteins. The repression activity of MYB3 to cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (<i>C4H</i>) gene expression is directly regulated by corepressors LNK1 and LNK2, which could facilitate binding of MYB3 with <i>C4H</i> promoter. The two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed Asp residues in both region 1 and 2 domain of LNKs are essential to mediate protein-protein interaction. Importantly, the Extra N-terminal Tail domain plays a negative role in LNK-MYB3 transcription complex-dependent repression of the <i>C4H</i> gene. We conclude that LNK1 and LNK2 act as transcriptional corepressors necessary for expression of the phenylpropanoids biosynthesis gene <i>C4H</i> through recruitment to its promoter via interaction with MYB3.</p>

SDH6 and SDH7 Contribute to Anchoring Succinate Dehydrogenase to the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The succinate dehydrogenase complex (complex II) is a highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed protein complex composed of the SDH1 to SDH4 subunits in bacteria and in the mitochondria of animals and fungi. The reason for the occurrence of up to four additional subunits in complex II of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, termed SDH5 to SDH8, so far is a mystery. Here, we present a biochemical approach to investigate the internal subunit arrangement of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) complex II. Using low-concentration detergent treatments, the holo complex is dissected into subcomplexes that are analyzed by a three-dimensional gel electrophoresis system. Protein identifications by mass spectrometry revealed that the largest subcomplex (IIa) represents the succinate dehydrogenase domain composed of SDH1 and SDH2. Another subcomplex (IIb) is composed of the SDH3, SDH4, SDH6, and SDH7 subunits. All four proteins include transmembrane helices and together form the membrane anchor of complex II. Sequence analysis revealed that SDH3 and SDH4 lack helices <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in other organisms. Using homology modeling and phylogenetic analyses, we present evidence that SDH6 and SDH7 substitute missing sequence stretches of SDH3 and SDH4 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts. Together with SDH5, which is liberated upon dissection of complex II into subcomplexes, SDH6 and SDH7 also add some hydrophilic mass to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t complex II, which possibly inserts further functions into this smallest protein complex of the oxidative phosphorylation system (which is not so small in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts).</p>

Rice Cellulose SynthaseA8 Plant-Conserved Region Is a Coiled-Coil at the Catalytic Core Entrance

Two antiparallel α-helices form a coiled-coil domain linked by a large extended connector loop containing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed trio of aromatic residues. The P-CR structure was fit into a molecular envelope for the P-CR domain derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data. The P-CR structure and molecular envelope, combined with a homology-based chain trace of the CesA8 catalytic core, were modeled into a previously determined CesA8 small-angle X-ray scattering molecular envelope to produce a detailed topological model of the CesA8 catalytic domain. The predicted position for the P-CR domain from the molecular docking models places the P-CR connector loop into a hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic core, with the coiled-coil aligned near the entrance of the substrate UDP-glucose into the active site. In this configuration, the P-CR coiled-coil alone is unlikely to regulate substrate access to the active site, but it could interact with other domains of CesA, accessory proteins, or other CesA catalytic domains to control substrate delivery.</p>

Analysis of Arabidopsis Accessions Hypersensitive to a Loss of Chloroplast Translation
<p>Natural accessions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differ in their ability to tolerate a loss of chloroplast translation. These differences can be attributed in part to variation in a duplicated nuclear gene (<i>ACC2</i>) that targets homomeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) to plastids. This functional redundancy allows limited fatty acid biosynthesis to occur in the absence of heteromeric ACCase, which is encoded in part by the plastid genome. In the presence of functional <i>ACC2</i>, tolerant alleles of several nuclear genes, not yet identified, enhance the growth of seedlings and embryos disrupted in chloroplast translation. <i>ACC2</i> knockout mutants, by contrast, are hypersensitive. Here we describe an expanded search for hypersensitive accessions of Arabidopsis, evaluate whether all of these accessions are defective in <i>ACC2</i>, and characterize genotype-to-phenotype relationships for homomeric ACCase variants identified among 855 accessions with sequenced genomes. Null alleles with <i>ACC2</i> nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, small deletions, genomic rearrangements, and defects in RNA splicing are included among the most sensitive accessions examined. By contrast, most missense mutations affecting highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues failed to eliminate ACC2 function. Several accessions were identified where sensitivity could not be attributed to a defect in either ACC2 or Tic20-IV, the chloroplast membrane channel required for ACC2 uptake. Overall, these results underscore the central role of <i>ACC2</i> in mediating Arabidopsis response to a loss of chloroplast translation, highlight future applications of this system to analyzing chloroplast protein import, and provide valuable insights into the mutational landscape of an important metabolic enzyme that is highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed throughout eukaryotes.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen development.</p>

Phosphorylation of GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 Alters Stimulation of Mg Chelatase Activity in Angiosperms
<p>GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 (GUN4) is a positive regulator of light-dependent chlorophyll biosynthesis. GUN4 activates Mg chelatase (MgCh) that catalyzes the insertion of an Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion into protoporphyrin IX. We show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GUN4 is phosphorylated at Ser 264 (S264), the penultimate amino acid residue at the C terminus. While GUN4 is preferentially phosphorylated in darkness, phosphorylation is reduced upon accumulation of Mg porphyrins. Expression of a phosphomimicking <i>GUN4</i>(S264D) results in an incomplete complementation of the white <i>gun4-2 null</i> mutant and a chlorotic phenotype comparable to <i>gun4</i> knockdown mutants. Phosphorylated GUN4 has a reduced stimulatory effect on MgCh in vitro and in vivo but retains its protein stability and tetrapyrrole binding capacity. Analysis of GUN4 found in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms reveals the evolution of a C-terminal extension, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>s the phosphorylation site of GUN4 expressed in angiosperms. Homologs of GUN4 from <i>Synechocystis</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas</i> lack the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed phosphorylation site found in a C-terminal extension of angiosperm GUN4. Biochemical studies proved the importance of the C-terminal extension for MgCh stimulation and inactivation of GUN4 by phosphorylation in angiosperms. An additional mechanism regulating MgCh activity is proposed. In conjunction with the dark repression of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis, GUN4 phosphorylation minimizes the flow of intermediates into the Mg branch of the tetrapyrrole metabolic pathway for chlorophyll biosynthesis.</p>

Molecular Evolution of the Yap/Yorkie Proto-Oncogene and Elucidation of Its Core Transcriptional Program
<p>Throughout Metazoa, developmental processes are controlled by a surprisingly limited number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed signaling pathways. Precisely how these signaling cassettes were assembled in early animal evolution remains poorly understood, as do the molecular transitions that potentiated the acquisition of their myriad developmental functions. Here we analyze the molecular evolution of the proto-oncogene yes-associated protein (Yap)/Yorkie, a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway that controls organ size in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals. Based on heterologous functional analysis of evolutionarily distant Yap/Yorkie orthologs, we demonstrate that a structurally distinct interaction interface between Yap/Yorkie and its partner TEAD/Scalloped became fixed in the eumetazoan common ancestor. We then combine transcriptional profiling of tissues expressing phylogenetically diverse forms of Yap/Yorkie with ChIP-seq validation to identify a common downstream gene expression program underlying the control of tissue growth in <i>Drosophila</i>. Intriguingly, a subset of the newly identified Yorkie target genes are also induced by Yap in mammalian tissues, thus revealing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed Yap-dependent gene expression signature likely to mediate organ size control throughout bilaterian animals. Combined, these experiments provide new mechanistic insights while revealing the ancient evolutionary history of Hippo signaling.</p>

The Repertoires of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Eukaryotic Genomes
<p>Reversible protein ubiquitination regulates virtually all known cellular activities. Here, we present a quantitatively evaluated and broadly applicable method to predict eukaryotic ubiquitinating enzymes (UBE) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) and its application to 50 distinct genomes belonging to four of the five major phylogenetic supergroups of eukaryotes: unikonts (including metazoans, fungi, choanozoa, and amoebozoa), excavates, chromalveolates, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts. Our method relies on a collection of profile hidden Markov models, and we demonstrate its superior performance (coverage and classification accuracy >99%) by identifying approximately 25% and approximately 35% additional UBE and DUB genes in yeast and human, which had not been reported before. In yeast, we predict 85 UBE and 24 DUB genes, for 814 UBE and 107 DUB genes in the human genome. Most UBE and DUB families are present in all eukaryotic lineages, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts and animals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing massively enlarged repertoires of ubiquitin ligases. Unicellular organisms, on the other hand, typically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong> less than 300 UBEs and less than 40 DUBs per genome. Ninety-one UBE/DUB genes are orthologous across all four eukaryotic supergroups, and these likely represent a primordial core of enzymes of the ubiquitination system probably dating back to the first eukaryotes approximately 2 billion years ago. Our genome-wide predictions are available through the Database of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes (<ext-link>www.DUDE-db.org</ext-link>), where users can also perform advanced sequence and phylogenetic analyses and submit their own predictions.</p>

However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012.

In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose.

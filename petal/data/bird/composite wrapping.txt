Wrapping with a splash: High-speed encapsulation with ultrathin sheets
<p>Many complex fluids rely on surfactants to contain, protect, or isolate liquid drops in an immiscible continuous phase. Thin elastic sheets can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong> liquid drops in a spontaneous process driven by capillary forces. For encapsulation by sheets to be practically viable, a rapid, continuous, and scalable process is essential. We exploit the fast dynamics of droplet impact to achieve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>ping of oil droplets by ultrathin polymer films in a water phase. Despite the violence of splashing events, the process robustly yields <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>pings that are optimally shaped to maximize the enclosed fluid volume and have near-perfect seams. We achieve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>pings of targeted three-dimensional (3D) shapes by tailoring the 2D boundary of the films and show the generality of the technique by producing both oil-in-water and water-in-oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>pings.</p>

Endothelial cell transitions
<p>Endothelial cells cover the internal surface of all types of vessels in the body and play a highly specialized role in protecting the vessel wall and the underlying tissues from noxious stimuli. These cells show organ-directed specialization and adapt to the requirements of different organs. However, in pathological conditions—such as inflammation, fibrosis, and atherosclerosis—endothelial cells can change their morphological and functional characteristics and acquire properties of other cell lineages such as fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and pericytes (which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong> around vessels) in a process called endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). This change of endothelial phenotype may increase the vascular responses to thrombosis (blood clot), decrease permeability control, and increase fibrotic reactions. In addition, when endothelial cells undergo EndMT, they release abnormal amounts and types of growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins that constitute important mediators in a dysfunctional cross-talk with the surrounding cells. Given the relevance of EndMT in several pathologies, understanding the molecular basis of EndMT could be instrumental for the development of new therapeutic interventions.</p>

Structural insight into precursor tRNA processing by yeast ribonuclease P
<p>Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a universal ribozyme responsible for processing the 5′-leader of pre–transfer RNA (pre-tRNA). Here, we report the 3.5-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structures of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> RNase P alone and in complex with pre-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>. The protein components form a hook-shaped architecture that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>s around the RNA and stabilizes RNase P into a “measuring device” with two fixed anchors that recognize the L-shaped pre-tRNA. A universally conserved uridine nucleobase and phosphate backbone in the catalytic center together with the scissile phosphate and the O3′ leaving group of pre-tRNA jointly coordinate two catalytic magnesium ions. Binding of pre-tRNA induces a conformational change in the catalytic center that is required for catalysis. Moreover, simulation analysis suggests a two-metal-ion S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction pathway of pre-tRNA cleavage. These results not only reveal the architecture of yeast RNase P but also provide a molecular basis of how the 5′-leader of pre-tRNA is processed by eukaryotic RNase P.</p>

Structure and dynamics of the yeast SWR1-nucleosome complex
<p>The yeast SWR1 complex exchanges histone H2A in nucleosomes with Htz1 (H2A.Z in humans). The cryo–electron microscopy structure of the SWR1 complex bound to a nucleosome at 3.6-angstrom resolution reveals details of the intricate interactions between components of the SWR1 complex and its nucleosome substrate. Interactions between the Swr1 motor domains and the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong> at superhelical location 2 distort the DNA, causing a bulge with concomitant translocation of the DNA by one base pair, coupled to conformational changes of the histone core. Furthermore, partial un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>ping of the DNA from the histone core takes place upon binding of nucleosomes to SWR1 complex. The un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>ping, as monitored by single-molecule data, is stabilized and has its dynamics altered by adenosine triphosphate binding but does not require hydrolysis.</p>

Structural basis of bacterial transcription activation
<p>In bacteria, the activation of gene transcription at many promoters is simple and only involves a single activator. The cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate receptor protein (CAP), a classic activator, is able to activate transcription independently through two different mechanisms. Understanding the class I mechanism requires an intact transcription activation complex (TAC) structure at a high resolution. Here we report a high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of an intact <i>Escherichia coli</i> class I TAC containing a CAP dimer, a σ<sup>70</sup>–RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme, a complete class I CAP-dependent promoter DNA, and a de novo synthesized RNA oligonucleotide. The structure shows how CAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>s the upstream DNA and how the interactions recruit RNAP. Our study provides a structural basis for understanding how activators activate transcription through the class I recruitment mechanism.</p>

Crystal structure of the human lysosomal mTORC1 scaffold complex and its impact on signaling
<p>The LAMTOR [late endosomal and lysosomal adaptor and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) activator] complex, also known as “Ragulator,” controls the activity of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) on the lysosome. The crystal structure of LAMTOR consists of two roadblock/LC7 domain–folded heterodimers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>ped and apparently held together by LAMTOR1, which assembles the complex on lysosomes. In addition, the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) associated with the pentamer through their carboxyl-terminal domains, predefining the orientation for interaction with mTORC1. In vitro reconstitution and experiments with site-directed mutagenesis defined the physiological importance of LAMTOR1 in assembling the remaining components to ensure fidelity of mTORC1 signaling. Functional data validated the effect of two short LAMTOR1 amino acid regions in recruitment and stabilization of the Rag GTPases.</p>

Structure of histone-based chromatin in Archaea
<p>Small basic proteins present in most Archaea share a common ancestor with the eukaryotic core histones. We report the crystal structure of an archaeal histone-DNA complex. DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>s around an extended polymer, formed by archaeal histone homodimers, in a quasi-continuous superhelix with the same geometry as DNA in the eukaryotic nucleosome. Substitutions of a conserved glycine at the interface of adjacent protein layers destabilize archaeal chromatin, reduce growth rate, and impair transcription regulation, confirming the biological importance of the polymeric structure. Our data establish that the histone-based mechanism of DNA compaction predates the nucleosome, illuminating the origin of the nucleosome.</p>

Crystal structure of the overlapping dinucleosome composed of hexasome and octasome
<p>Nucleosomes are dynamic entities that are repositioned along DNA by chromatin remodeling processes. A nucleosome repositioned by the switch-sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) remodeler collides with a neighbor and forms the intermediate “overlapping dinucleosome.” Here, we report the crystal structure of the overlapping dinucleosome, in which two nucleosomes are associated, at 3.14-angstrom resolution. In the overlapping dinucleosome structure, the unusual “hexasome” nucleosome, composed of the histone hexamer lacking one H2A-H2B dimer from the conventional histone octamer, contacts the canonical “octasome” nucleosome, and they intimately associate. Consequently, about 250 base pairs of DNA are left-handedly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>ped in three turns, without a linker DNA segment between the hexasome and octasome moieties. The overlapping dinucleosome structure may provide important information to understand how nucleosome repositioning occurs during the chromatin remodeling process.</p>

Mutation of a nucleosome compaction region disrupts Polycomb-mediated axial patterning
<p>Nucleosomes play important structural and regulatory roles by tightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>ping the DNA that constitutes the metazoan genome. The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins modulate nucleosomes to maintain repression of key developmental genes, including <i>Hox</i> genes whose temporal and spatial expression is tightly regulated to guide patterning of the anterior-posterior body axis. CBX2, a component of the mammalian Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), contains a compaction region that has the biochemically defined activity of bridging adjacent nucleosomes. Here, we demonstrate that a functional compaction region is necessary for proper body patterning, because mutating this region leads to homeotic transformations similar to those observed with PcG loss-of-function mutations. We propose that CBX2-driven nucleosome compaction is a key mechanism by which PcG proteins maintain gene silencing during mouse development.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also binds with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> channels already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which assembles with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, binds to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> channel via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to channel-gating control. Binding to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed channel gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 binding without influencing gating. Channel binding was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong> around this structure when not assembled with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed channel binding and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two channel-binding sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex assembly, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that binding begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> channel gating during SNARE assembly and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> channels are nucleation points for SNARE complex assembly.</p>

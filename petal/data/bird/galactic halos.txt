Magnetic field–induced pair density wave state in the cuprate vortex halo
<p>High magnetic fields suppress cuprate superconductivity to reveal an unusual density wave (DW) state coexisting with unexplained quantum oscillations. Although routinely labeled a charge density wave (CDW), this DW state could actually be an electron-pair density wave (PDW). To search for evidence of a field-induced PDW, we visualized modulations in the density of electronic states <i>N</i>(<i>r</i>) within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halo</span></strong> surrounding Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> vortex cores. We detected numerous phenomena predicted for a field-induced PDW, including two sets of particle-hole symmetric <i>N</i>(<i>r</i>) modulations with wave vectors <bold><i>Q<sub>P</sub></i></bold> and <bold>2<i>Q</i><sub>P</sub></bold>, with the latter decaying twice as rapidly from the core as the former. These data imply that the primary field-induced state in underdoped superconducting cuprates is a PDW, with approximately eight CuO<sub>2</sub> unit-cell periodicity and coexisting with its secondary CDWs.</p>

Supersonic gas streams enhance the formation of massive black holes in the early universe
<p>The origin of super-massive black holes in the early universe remains poorly understood. Gravitational collapse of a massive primordial gas cloud is a promising initial process, but theoretical studies have difficulty growing the black hole fast enough. We report numerical simulations of early black hole formation starting from realistic cosmological conditions. Supersonic gas motions left over from the Big Bang prevent early gas cloud formation until rapid gas condensation is triggered in a protogalactic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halo</span></strong>. A protostar is formed in the dense, turbulent gas cloud, and it grows by sporadic mass accretion until it acquires 34,000 solar masses. The massive star ends its life with a catastrophic collapse to leave a black hole—a promising seed for the formation of a monstrous black hole.</p>

Predictors of mortality following conservatively managed fractures of the odontoid in elderly patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Rates of mortality as high as 25% to 30% have been described   following fractures of the odontoid in the elderly population. The   aim of this study was to examine whether easily identifiable variables   present on admission are associated with mortality. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A consecutive series of 83 elderly patients with a fracture of   the odontoid following a low-impact injury was identified retrospectively.   Data that were collected included demographics, past medical history   and the results of blood tests on admission. Radiological investigations   were used to assess the Anderson and D’Alonzo classification and   displacement of the fracture. The mean age was 82.9 years (65 to   101). Most patients (66; 79.5%) had a type 2 fracture. An associated   neurological deficit was present in 11 (13.3%). All were treated   conservatively; 80 (96.4%) with a hard collar and three (3.6%) with   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halo</span></strong> vest immobilisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The rate of mortality was 16% (13 patients) at 30 days and 24%   (20 patients) at one year after injury. A low serum level of haemoglobin   and the presence of a neurological deficit on admission were independent   predicators of mortality at 30 days on binary logistic regression   analysis. A, low level of haemoglobin, admission from an institution,   a neurological deficit and type 3 fractures were independent predictors   of mortality at one year. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We suggest that these easily identifiable predictors present   on admission can be used to identify patients at high risk and guide   management by a multidisciplinary team.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:116–21.</p></sec>

Large-amplitude transfer motion of hydrated excess protons mapped by ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy
<p>Solvation and transport of excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s in aqueous systems play a fundamental role in acid-base chemistry and biochemical processes. We mapped ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> excursions along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfer coordinate by means of two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, both in bulk water and in a Zundel cation (H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup> motif selectively prepared in acetonitrile. Electric fields from the environment and stochastic hydrogen bond motions induce fluctuations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> double-minimum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al. Within the lifetime of a particular hydration geometry, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> explores a multitude of positions on a sub-100-femtosecond time scale. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfer vibration is strongly damped by its 20- to 40-femtosecond population decay. Our results suggest a central role of Zundel-like geometries in aqueous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> solvation and transport.</p>

A coupled-clock system drives the automaticity of human sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells
<p>The spontaneous rhythmic action <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>als generated by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker in the heart, dictate the regular and optimal cardiac contractions that pump blood around the body. Although the heart rate of humans is substantially slower than that of smaller experimental animals, current perspectives on the biophysical mechanisms underlying the automaticity of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells (SANCs) have been gleaned largely from studies of animal hearts. Using human SANCs, we demonstrated that spontaneous rhythmic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases generated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> clock were coupled to electrogenic surface membrane molecules (the M clock) to trigger rhythmic action <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>als, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup>–cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling regulated clock coupling. When these clocks became uncoupled, SANCs failed to generate spontaneous action <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>als, showing a depolarized membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al and disorganized local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases that failed to activate the M clock. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, which increases cAMP concentrations and clock coupling in other species, restored spontaneous, rhythmic action <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>als in some nonbeating “arrested” human SANCs by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and synchronizing diastolic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases. When β-AR stimulation was withdrawn, the clocks again became uncoupled, and SANCs reverted to a nonbeating arrested state. Thus, automaticity of human pacemaker cells is driven by a coupled-clock system driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling. Extreme clock uncoupling led to failure of spontaneous action <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al generation, which was restored by recoupling of the clocks. Clock coupling and action <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al firing in some of these arrested cells can be restored by β-AR stimulation–induced augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling.</p>

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings
<p>Saturn has a sufficiently strong dipole magnetic field to trap high-energy charged particles and form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion belts, which have been observed outside its rings. Whether stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion belts exist near the planet and inward of the rings was previously unknown. The Cassini spacecraft’s Magnetosphere Imaging Instrument obtained measurements of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion belt that lies just above Saturn’s dense atmosphere and is decoupled from the rest of the magnetosphere by the planet’s A- to C-rings. The belt extends across the D-ring and comprises <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s produced through cosmic ray albedo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> decay and multiple charge-exchange reactions. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s are lost to atmospheric neutrals and D-ring dust. Strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> depletions that map onto features on the D-ring indicate a highly structured and diverse dust environment near Saturn.</p>

Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity underlies CA1 place fields
<p>Learning is primarily mediated by activity-dependent modifications of synaptic strength within neuronal circuits. We discovered that place fields in hippocampal area CA1 are produced by a synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>ation notably different from Hebbian plasticity. Place fields could be produced in vivo in a single trial by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>ation of input that arrived seconds before and after complex spiking. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>ated synaptic input was not initially coincident with action <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>als or depolarization. This rule, named behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity, abruptly modifies inputs that were neither causal nor close in time to postsynaptic activation. In slices, five pairings of subthreshold presynaptic activity and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) plateau <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>als produced a large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>ation with an asymmetric seconds-long time course. This plasticity efficiently stores entire behavioral sequences within synaptic weights to produce predictive place cell activity.</p>

Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling draws heat from surfaces and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>es it into space as infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling as a viable energy technology.</p>

Synchrotron radiation from an accelerating light pulse
<p>Synchrotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion—namely, electromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion produced by charges moving in a curved path—is regularly generated at large-scale facilities where giga–electron volt electrons move along kilometer-long circular paths.

The emitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, in the terahertz frequency range, results from the nonlinear polarization induced by the pulse.

Measurement of the neutron lifetime using a magneto-gravitational trap and in situ detection
<p>The precise value of the mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> lifetime, τ<sub>n</sub>, plays an important role in nuclear and particle physics and cosmology. It is used to predict the ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s to helium atoms in the primordial universe and to search for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. We eliminated loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by levitating polarized ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong>s above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong>s do not interact with material trap walls. As a result of this approach and the use of an in situ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> detector, the lifetime reported here [877.7 ± 0.7 (stat) +0.4/–0.2 (sys) seconds] does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.</p>

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p>Ion channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified ion channels selective for other monatomic ions, only one type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective ion channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective ion channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels. Evolutionary conservation of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribution suggest a broad role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Cardiovascular Effects of Performance-Enhancing Drugs
<p>Exercise and competitive sports should be associated with a wide range of health benefits with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al to inspire a positive community health legacy. However, the reputation of sports is being threatened by an ever-expanding armamentarium of agents with real or perceived benefits in performance enhancement. In addition to the injustice of unfair advantage for dishonest athletes, significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al health risks are associated with performance-enhancing drugs. Performance-enhancing drugs may have an effect on the cardiovascular system by means of directly altering the myocardium, vasculature, and metabolism. However, less frequently considered is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al for indirect effects caused through enabling athletes to push beyond normal physiological limits with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al consequence of exercise-induced arrhythmias. This review will summarize the known health effects of PEDs but will also focus on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>ally greater health threat posed by the covert search for performance-enhancing agents that have yet to be recognized by the World Anti-Doping Agency. History has taught us that athletes are subjected to unmonitored trials with experimental drugs that have little or no established efficacy or safety data. One approach to decrease drug abuse in sports would be to accept that there is a delay from when athletes start experimenting with novel agents to the time when authorities become aware of these drugs. This provides a window of opportunity for athletes to exploit with relative immunity. It could be argued that all off-label use of any agent should be deemed illegal.</p>

Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Older Women After Contemporary Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes are resistant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. However, cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation, a perturbation implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) and particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Radiotherapy for breast cancer results in variable cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure and may increase the risk of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a population-based case-control study of incident HF in 170 female residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (59 cases and 111 controls), who underwent contemporary (1998–2013) radiotherapy for breast cancer with computed tomography–assisted radiotherapy planning. Controls were matched to cases for age, tumor side, chemotherapy use, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Mean cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion dose (MCRD) in each patient was calculated from the patient’s computed tomography images and radiotherapy plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean age at radiotherapy was 69±9 years. Of HF cases, 38 (64%) had EF≥50% (HFpEF), 18 (31%) had EF<50% (HF with reduced EF), and 3 (5%) did not have EF measured. The EF was ≥40% in 50 of the 56 HF cases (89%) with an EF measurement. The mean interval from radiotherapy to HF was 5.8±3.4 years. The odds of HF was higher in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or atrial fibrillation. The MCRD was 2.5 Gy (range, 0.2–13.1 Gy) and higher in cases (3.3±2.7 Gy) than controls (2.1±2.0 Gy; <i>P</i>=0.004). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HF per log MCRD was 9.1 (3.4–24.4) for any HF, 16.9 (3.9–73.7) for HFpEF, and 3.17 (0.8–13.0) for HF with reduced EF. The increased odds of any HF or HFpEF with increasing MCRD remained significant after adjustment for HF risk factors and in sensitivity analyses matching by cancer stage rather than tumor side. Only 18.6% of patients experienced new or recurrent ischemic events between radiotherapy and the onset of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The relative risk of HFpEF increases with increasing cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure during contemporary conformal breast cancer radiotherapy. These data emphasize the importance of radiotherapy techniques that limit MCRD during breast cancer treatment. Moreover, these data provide further support for the importance of coronary microvascular compromise in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.</p></sec>

Osmotic and hydraulic adjustment of mangrove saplings to extreme salinity
<p>Salinity tolerance in plant species varies widely due to adaptation and acclimation processes at the cellular and whole-plant scales. In mangroves, extreme substrate salinity induces hydraulic failure and ion excess toxicity and reduces growth and survival, thus suggesting a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>ally critical role for physiological acclimation to salinity. We tested the hypothesis that osmotic adjustment, a key type of plasticity that mitigates salinity shock, would take place in coordination with declines in whole-plant hydraulic conductance in a common garden experiment using saplings of three mangrove species with different salinity tolerances (<i>Avicennia germinans</i> L., <i>Rhizophora mangle</i> L. and <i>Laguncularia racemosa</i> (L.) C.F. Gaertn., ordered from higher to lower salinity tolerance). For each mangrove species, four salinity treatments (1, 10, 30 and 50 practical salinity units) were established and the time trajectories were determined for leaf osmotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al (Ψ<sub>s</sub>), stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), whole-plant hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>) and predawn disequilibrium between xylem and substrate water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>als (Ψ<sub>pdd</sub>). We expected that, for all three species, salinity increments would result in coordinated declines in Ψ<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, and that the Ψ<sub>pdd</sub> would increase with substrate salinity and time of exposure. In concordance with our predictions, reductions in substrate water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al promoted a coordinated decline in Ψ<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, whereas the Ψ<sub>pdd</sub> increased substantially during the first 4 days but dissipated after 7 days, indicating a time lag for equilibration after a change in substratum salinity. Our results show that mangroves confront and partially ameliorate acute salinity stress via simultaneous reductions in Ψ<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, thus developing synergistic physiological responses at the cell and whole-plant scales.</p>

Radiation inhibits salivary gland function by promoting STIM1 cleavage by caspase-3 and loss of SOCE through a TRPM2-dependent pathway
<p>Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) is critical for salivary gland fluid secretion. We report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion treatment caused persistent salivary gland dysfunction by activating a TRPM2-dependent mitochondrial pathway, leading to caspase-3–mediated cleavage of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and loss of SOCE. After ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, acinar cells from the submandibular glands of <i>TRPM2</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup>, but not those from <i>TRPM2</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice, displayed an increase in the concentrations of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reactive oxygen species, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al, and activation of caspase-3, which was associated with a sustained decrease in STIM1 abundance and attenuation of SOCE. In a salivary gland cell line, silencing the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter or caspase-3 or treatment with inhibitors of TRPM2 or caspase-3 prevented ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion-induced loss of STIM1 and SOCE. Expression of exogenous STIM1 in the salivary glands of ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed mice increased SOCE and fluid secretion.

Light curves of the neutron star merger GW170817/SSS17a: Implications for r-process nucleosynthesis

An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the ejection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong>-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star mergers play a role in rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

Illuminating gravitational waves: A concordant picture of photons from a neutron star merger
<p>Merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> stars offer an excellent laboratory for simultaneously studying strong-field gravity and matter in extreme environments. We establish the physical association of an electromagnetic counterpart (EM170817) with gravitational waves (GW170817) detected from merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> stars. By synthesizing a panchromatic data set, we demonstrate that merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> stars are a long-sought production site forging heavy elements by r-process nucleosynthesis. The weak gamma rays seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-ray bursts with ultrarelativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet explains the low-luminosity gamma rays, the high-luminosity ultraviolet-optical-infrared, and the delayed radio and x-ray emission. We posit that all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star mergers may lead to a wide-angle cocoon breakout, sometimes accompanied by a successful jet and sometimes by a choked jet.</p>

The DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome controls radiation-induced cell death and tissue injury
<p>Acute exposure to ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion induces massive cell death and severe damage to tissues containing actively proliferating cells, including bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology remain controversial.

Low Water Potential and At14a-Like1 (AFL1) Effects on Endocytosis and Actin Filament Organization
<p>At14a-Like1 (AFL1) is a stress-induced protein of unknown function that promotes growth during low water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al stress and drought. Previous analysis indicated that AFL1 may have functions related to endocytosis and regulation of actin filament organization, processes for which the effects of low water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al are little known. We found that low water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al led to a decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the membrane-impermeable dye FM4-64. Ectopic expression of AFL1 reversed the decrease in FM4-64 uptake seen in wild type, while reduced AFL1 expression led to further inhibition of FM4-64 uptake. Increased AFL1 also made FM4-64 uptake less sensitive to the actin filament disruptor Latrunculin B (LatB). LatB decreased AFL1-Clathrin Light Chain colocalization, further indicating that effects of AFL1 on endocytosis may be related to actin filament organization or stability. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic AFL1 expression made actin filaments less sensitive to disruption by LatB or Cytochalasin D and led to increased actin filament skewness and decreased occupancy, indicative of more bundled actin filaments. This latter effect could be partially mimicked by the actin filament stabilizer Jasplakinolide (JASP). However, AFL1 did not substantially inhibit actin filament dynamics, indicating that AFL1 acts via a different mechanism than JASP-induced stabilization. AFL1 partially colocalized with actin filaments but not with microtubules, further indicating actin-filament–related function of AFL1. These data provide insight into endocytosis and actin filament responses to low water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al stress and demonstrate an involvement of AFL1 in these key cellular processes.</p>

The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under visible and UV-B light. The mode of transcriptional regulation of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcription factors regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription and also posttranscriptionally modulate HY5 to control photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in visible and UV-B light signal transduction in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> expression is induced by UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and regulates its transcript levels. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive regulator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interaction studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> regulates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no evidence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interaction, and they primarily regulate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, BBX31 promotes the accumulation of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion by regulating genes involved in photoprotection and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner. Under UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, overexpression of <i>BBX31</i> enhances <i>HY5</i> transcriptional levels in a UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8-dependent manner, suggesting that BBX31 might regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription.</p>

Glycolate Induces Redox Tuning Of Photosystem II in Vivo: Study of a Photorespiration Mutant
<p>Bicarbonate removal from the nonheme iron at the acceptor side of photosystem II (PSII) was shown recently to shift the midpoint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al of the primary quinone acceptor Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al and lowers the yield of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) production. The presence of Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> results in weaker binding of bicarbonate, suggesting a redox-based regulatory and protective mechanism where loss of bicarbonate or exchange of bicarbonate by other small carboxylic acids may protect PSII against <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in vivo under photorespiratory conditions. Here, we compared the properties of Q<sub>A</sub> in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) photorespiration mutant deficient in peroxisomal HYDROXYPYRUVATE REDUCTASE1 (<i>hpr1-1</i>), which accumulates glycolate in leaves, with the wild type. Photosynthetic electron transport was affected in the mutant, and chlorophyll fluorescence showed slower electron transport between Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> in the mutant. Glycolate induced an increase in the temperature maximum of thermoluminescence emission, indicating a shift of the midpoint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al of Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive value. The yield of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production was lowered in thylakoid membranes isolated from <i>hpr1-1</i> compared with the wild type, consistent with a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al of Q<sub>A</sub>/Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup>. In addition, electron donation to photosystem I was affected in <i>hpr1-1</i> at higher light intensities, consistent with diminished electron transfer out of PSII. This study indicates that replacement of bicarbonate at the nonheme iron by a small carboxylate anion occurs in plants in vivo. These findings suggested that replacement of the bicarbonate on the nonheme iron by glycolate may represent a regulatory mechanism that protects PSII against photooxidative stress under low-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p>

Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies
<p>Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing the efficiency with which solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion is converted into biomass has recently become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and photoprotection in natural environments, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>ally over the entire crop lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) and irradiance was measured in five cultivars of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. This relationship differed substantially from that observed for conventional short term light response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. Genotypic variation in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective dissipation became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, estimated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

Reversible Leaf Xylem Collapse: A Potential “Circuit Breaker” against Cavitation
<p>We report a novel form of xylem dysfunction in angiosperms: reversible collapse of the xylem conduits of the smallest vein orders that demarcate and intrusively irrigate the areoles of red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy revealed gradual increases in collapse from approximately −2 MPa down to −3 MPa, saturating thereafter (to −4 MPa). Over this range, cavitation remained negligible in these veins. Imaging of rehydration experiments showed spatially variable recovery from collapse within 20 s and complete recovery after 2 min. More broadly, the patterns of deformation induced by desiccation in both mesophyll and xylem suggest that cell wall collapse is unlikely to depend solely on individual wall properties, as mechanical constraints imposed by neighbors appear to be important. From the perspective of equilibrium leaf water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>als, petioles, whose vessels extend into the major veins, showed a vulnerability to cavitation that overlapped in the water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al domain with both minor vein collapse and buckling (turgor loss) of the living cells. However, models of transpiration transients showed that minor vein collapse and mesophyll capacitance could effectively buffer major veins from cavitation over time scales relevant to the rectification of stomatal wrong-way responses. We suggest that, for angiosperms, whose subsidiary cells give up large volumes to allow large stomatal apertures at the cost of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>ally large wrong-way responses, vein collapse could make an important contribution to these plants’ ability to transpire near the brink of cavitation-inducing water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>als.</p>

Large Numbers of Novel miRNAs Originate from DNA Transposons and Are Coincident with a Large Species Radiation in Bats
<p>Vesper bats (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a rapid adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion beginning around 36 Ma that resulted in the second most species-rich mammalian family (>400 species). Coincident with that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion was an initial burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present in some species. Such extensive and recent DNA transposon activity has not been seen in any other extant mammal. Indeed, retrotransposon activity is much more common in all other sequenced mammal genomes. Deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction from a vespertilionid bat, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, as well as a dog and horse revealed large numbers of 17–24 bp putative miRNAs (p/miRNAs). Although the origination rate of p/miRNAs is similar in all three taxa, 61.1% of postdivergence p/miRNAs in <i>Eptesicus</i> are derived from transposable elements (TEs) compared with only 23.9% and 16.5% in the dog and horse, respectively. Not surprisingly, given the retrotransposon bias of dog and horse, the majority of TE-derived p/miRNAs are associated with retrotransposons. In <i>Eptesicus</i>, however, 58.7% of the TE-derived and 35.9% of the total p/miRNAs arose not from retrotransposons but from bat-specific DNA transposons. Notably, we observe that the timing of the DNA transposon expansion and the resulting introduction of novel p/miRNAs coincide with the rapid diversification of the family Vespertilionidae. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al targets of the DNA transposon-derived p/miRNAs are identifiable and enriched for genes that are important for regulation of transcription. We propose that lineage-specific DNA transposon activity lead to the rapid and repeated introduction of novel p/miRNAs. Some of these p/miRNAs are likely functional miRNAs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>ally influenced the diversification of Vespertilionidae. Our observations suggest a mechanism for introducing functional genomic variation rapidly through the expansion of DNA transposons that fits within the TE-thrust hypothesis.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong selection, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive selection. Positively selected genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying selection and more widespread positive selection in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions.</p>

Transmembrane voltage potential is an essential cellular parameter for the detection and control of tumor development in a <i>Xenopus</i> model
<p>Understanding mechanisms that orchestrate cell behavior into appropriately patterned tissues and organs within the organism is an essential element of preventing, detecting and treating cancer. Bioelectric signals (resting transmembrane voltage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al gradients in all cells) underlie an important and broadly conserved set of control mechanisms that regulate pattern formation. We tested the role of transmembrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al in tumorigenesis mediated by canonical oncogenes in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>. Depolarized membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al (<i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>) was a characteristic of induced tumor-like structures (ITLSs) generated by overexpression of <i>Gli1</i>, <i>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></i>, <i>Xrel3</i> or <i>p53<sup>Trp248</sup></i>. This bioelectric signature was also present in precursor ITLS sites. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a bioelectric marker that reveals ITLSs before they become histologically and morphologically apparent. Moreover, voltage was functionally important: overexpression of hyperpolarizing ion transporters caused a return to normal <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> and significantly reduced ITLS formation <i>in vivo</i>. To characterize the molecular mechanism by which <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> change regulates ITLS phenotypes, we performed a suppression screen. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> hyperpolarization was transduced into downstream events via <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>-regulated activity of SLC5A8, a sodium-butyrate exchanger previously implicated in human cancer. These data indicate that butyrate, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, might be responsible for transcriptional events that mediate suppression of ITLSs by hyperpolarization. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a convenient cellular parameter by which tumors induced by human oncogenes can be detected <i>in vivo</i> and represents a new diagnostic modality. Moreover, control of resting membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al is functionally involved in the process by which oncogene-bearing cells depart from normal morphogenesis programs to form tumors. Modulation of <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> levels is a novel and promising strategy for tumor normalization.</p>

Increase in Endovascular Therapy in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke After the Publication of Pivotal Trials
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Beginning in December 2014, a series of pivotal trials showed that endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was highly effective, prompting calls to reorganize stroke systems of care.

Compact radio emission indicates a structured jet was produced by a binary neutron star merger
<p>The binary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star merger event GW170817 was detected through both electromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion and gravitational waves. Its afterglow emission may have been produced by either a narrow relativistic jet or an isotropic outflow. High-spatial-resolution measurements of the source size and displacement can discriminate between these scenarios. We present very-long-baseline interferometry observations, performed 207.4 days after the merger by using a global network of 32 radio telescopes. The apparent source size is constrained to be smaller than 2.5 milli–arc seconds at the 90% confidence level. This excludes the isotropic outflow scenario, which would have produced a larger apparent size, indicating that GW170817 produced a structured relativistic jet. Our rate calculations show that at least 10% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star mergers produce such a jet.</p>

Aerosol-driven droplet concentrations dominate coverage and water of oceanic low-level clouds
<p>A lack of reliable estimates of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) aerosols over oceans has severely limited our ability to quantify their effects on cloud properties and extent of cooling by reflecting solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion—a key uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. We introduce a methodology for ascribing cloud properties to CCN and isolating the aerosol effects from meteorological effects. Its application showed that for a given meteorology, CCN explains three-fourths of the variability in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling effect of clouds, mainly through affecting shallow cloud cover and water path. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of cloud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive forcing to CCN than previously reported, which means too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This suggests the existence of compensating aerosol warming effects yet to be discovered, possibly through deep clouds.</p>

Rapid Pliocene adaptive radiation of modern kangaroos
<p>Differentiating between ancient and younger, more rapidly evolved clades is important for determining paleoenvironmental drivers of diversification. Australia possesses many aridity-adapted lineages, the origins of which have been closely linked to late Miocene continental aridification.

In contrast, low-crowned, short-faced kangaroos <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed into predominantly browsing niches as the late Cenozoic became more arid, contradicting the view that this was an interval of global browser decline.

Atomic model for the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> region of mitochondrial ATP synthase

However, the vibrational spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk water. Here we report how the much simpler vibrational spectra of cold, composition-selected heavy water clusters, D<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>, can be exploited to capture clear markers that encode the collective reaction coordinate along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-transfer event. By complexing the solvated hydronium “Eigen” cluster [D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>] with increasingly strong H-bond acceptor molecules (D<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO, and D<sub>2</sub>O), we are able to track the frequency of every O-D stretch vibration in the complex as the transferring hydron is incrementally pulled from the central hydronium to a neighboring water molecule.</p>

Visualizing Embolism Propagation in Gas-Injected Leaves
<p>Because the xylem in leaves is thought to be at the greatest risk of cavitation, reliable and efficient methods to characterize leaf xylem vulnerability are of interest. We report a method to generate leaf xylem vulnerability curves (VCs) by gas injection. Using optical light transmission, we visualized embolism propagation in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves injected with positive gas pressure. This resulted in a rapid, stepwise reduction of transmitted light, identical to that observed during leaf dehydration, confirming that the optical method detects gas bubbles and provides insights into the air-seeding hypothesis. In red oak, xylem VCs generated using gas injection were similar to those generated using bench dehydration, but indicated 50% loss of conductivity at lower tension (∼0.4 MPa) in grapevine. In determining VC, this method eliminates the need to ascertain xylem tension, thus avoiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al errors in water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al estimations. It is also much faster (1 h per VC). However, severing the petiole and applying high-pressure gas could affect air-seeding and the generated VC. We discuss <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al artifacts arising from gas injection and recommend comparison of this method with a more standard procedure before it is assumed to be suitable for a given species.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Environmental and Genetic Factors Regulating Localization of the Plant Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase
<p>A P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is the primary transporter that converts ATP to electrochemical energy at the plasma membrane of higher plants. Its product, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-motive force, is composed of an electrical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al and a pH gradient. Many studies have demonstrated that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-motive force not only drives the secondary transporters required for nutrient uptake, but also plays a direct role in regulating cell expansion. Here, we have generated a transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plant expressing H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2) that is translationally fused with a fluorescent protein and examined its cellular localization by live-cell microscopy. Using a 3D imaging approach with seedlings grown for various times under a variety of light intensities, we demonstrate that AHA2 localization at the plasma membrane of root cells requires light. In dim light conditions, AHA2 is found in intracellular compartments, in addition to the plasma membrane. This localization profile was age-dependent and specific to cell types found in the transition zone located between the meristem and elongation zones. The accumulation of AHA2 in intracellular compartments is consistent with reduced H<sup>+</sup> secretion near the transition zone and the suppression of root growth. By examining AHA2 localization in a knockout mutant of a receptor protein kinase, FERONIA, we found that the intracellular accumulation of AHA2 in the transition zone is dependent on a functional FERONIA-dependent inhibitory response in root elongation. Overall, this study provides a molecular underpinning for understanding the genetic, environmental, and developmental factors influencing root growth via localization of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p>

Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (γ) of xylem sap plays a key role in stabilizing air-water interfaces at the pits between water- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>als. We studied seasonal changes in xylem sap γ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine timberline. We analyzed their vulnerability to drought-induced embolism using solutions of different γ and estimated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al effect of seasonal changes in γ on hydraulic vulnerability. In both species, xylem sap γ showed distinct seasonal courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. Solutions with low γ caused higher vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism. The water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al at 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was −3.35 and −3.86 MPa at γ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup> but −2.11 and −2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa seasonal variation in 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity. The results revealed pronounced effects of changes in xylem sap γ on the hydraulic safety of trees in situ. These effects also are relevant in vulnerability analyses, where the use of standard solutions with high γ overestimates hydraulic safety. Thus, γ should be considered carefully in hydraulic studies.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al.</p>

UV-B Inhibits Leaf Growth through Changes in Growth Regulating Factors and Gibberellin Levels
<p>Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion affects leaf growth in a wide range of species. In this work, we demonstrate that UV-B levels present in solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion inhibit maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf growth without causing any other visible stress symptoms, including the accumulation of DNA damage. We conducted kinematic analyses of cell division and expansion to understand the impact of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion on these cellular processes. Our results demonstrate that the decrease in leaf growth in UV-B-ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed leaves is a consequence of a reduction in cell production and a shortened growth zone (GZ). To determine the molecular pathways involved in UV-B inhibition of leaf growth, we performed RNA sequencing on isolated GZ tissues of control and UV-B-exposed plants. Our results show a link between the observed leaf growth inhibition and the expression of specific cell cycle and developmental genes, including growth-regulating factors (GRFs) and transcripts for proteins participating in different hormone pathways. Interestingly, the decrease in the GZ size correlates with a decrease in the concentration of GA19, the immediate precursor of the active gibberellin, GA1, by UV-B in this zone, which is regulated, at least in part, by the expression of GRF1 and possibly other transcription factors of the GRF family.</p>

Molecular Regulation of Temperature-Dependent Floral Induction in <i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>
<p>The vegetative-to-reproductive phase change in tulip (<i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>) is promoted by increasing temperatures during spring. The warm winters of recent years interfere with this process and are calling for new adapted cultivars. A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms would be of help, but unlike the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), very little is known about floral induction in tulip. To shed light on the gene regulatory network controlling flowering in tulip, RNA sequencing was performed on meristem-enriched tissue collected under two contrasting temperature conditions, low and high. The start of reproductive development correlated with rounding of the shoot apical meristem and induction of <i>TGSQA</i> expression, a tulip gene with a high similarity to Arabidopsis <i>APETALA1</i>. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed the overrepresentation of genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>ally involved in floral induction, bulb maturation, and dormancy establishment. Expression analysis revealed that <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TgTFL1</i>) and <i>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1-like1</i> (<i>TgSOC1-like1</i>) might be repressors, whereas <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> likely is an activator, of flowering. Subsequently, the flowering time-associated expression of eight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al flowering time genes was confirmed in three tulip cultivars grown in the field. Additionally, heterologous functional analyses in Arabidopsis resulted in flowering time phenotypes in line with <i>TgTFL1</i> being a floral repressor and <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> being a floral activator in tulip. Taken together, we have shown that long before morphological changes occur in the shoot apical meristem, the expression of floral repressors in tulip is suppressed by increased ambient temperatures, leading either directly or indirectly to the activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al flowering activators shortly before the commencement of the phase change.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>ally prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin concentration. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total hemoglobin concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potenti</span></strong>al cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

A coupled-clock system drives the automaticity of human sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells
<p>The spontaneous rhythmic action potentials generated by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker in the heart, dictate the regular and optimal cardiac contractions that pump blood around the body. Although the heart rate of humans is substantially slower than that of smaller experimental animals, current perspectives on the biophysical mechanisms underlying the automaticity of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells (SANCs) have been gleaned largely from studies of animal hearts. Using human SANCs, we demonstrated that spontaneous rhythmic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases generated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> were coupled to electrogenic surface membrane molecules (the M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>) to trigger rhythmic action potentials, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup>–cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> coupling. When these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>s became uncoupled, SANCs failed to generate spontaneous action potentials, showing a depolarized membrane potential and disorganized local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases that failed to activate the M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, which increases cAMP concentrations and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> coupling in other species, restored spontaneous, rhythmic action potentials in some nonbeating “arrested” human SANCs by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synchron</span></strong>izing diastolic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases. When β-AR stimulation was withdrawn, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>s again became uncoupled, and SANCs reverted to a nonbeating arrested state. Thus, automaticity of human pacemaker cells is driven by a coupled-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> system driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling. Extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> uncoupling led to failure of spontaneous action potential generation, which was restored by recoupling of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> coupling and action potential firing in some of these arrested cells can be restored by β-AR stimulation–induced augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling.</p>

Distinct control of PERIOD2 degradation and circadian rhythms by the oncoprotein and ubiquitin ligase MDM2
<p>The circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> relies on posttranslational modifications to set the timing for degradation of core regulatory components, which drives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> progression. Ubiquitin-modifying enzymes that target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> components for degradation mainly recognize phosphorylated substrates. Degradation of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> component PERIOD 2 (PER2) is mediated by its phospho-specific recognition by β-transducin repeat–containing proteins (β-TrCPs), which are F-box–containing proteins that function as substrate recognition subunits of the SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex. However, this mode of regulating PER2 stability falls short of explaining the persistent oscillatory phenotypes reported in biological systems lacking functional elements of the phospho-dependent PER2 degradation machinery. We identified PER2 as a previously uncharacterized substrate for the ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and found that MDM2 targeted PER2 for degradation in a manner independent of PER2 phosphorylation. Deregulation of MDM2 plays a major role in oncogenesis by contributing to the accumulation of genomic and epigenomic alterations that favor tumor development. MDM2-mediated PER2 turnover was important for defining the circadian period length in mammalian cells, a finding that emphasizes the connection between the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> and cancer. Our results not only broaden the range of specific substrates of MDM2 beyond the cell cycle to include circadian components but also identify a previously unknown regulator of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> as a druggable node that is often found to be deregulated during tumorigenesis.</p>

Decoys Untangle Complicated Redundancy and Reveal Targets of Circadian Clock F-Box Proteins
<p>Eukaryotic circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>s utilize the ubiquitin proteasome system to precisely degrade <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> proteins. In plants, the F-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligases ZEITLUPE (ZTL), FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX1 (FKF1), and LOV KELCH PROTEIN2 (LKP2) regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> period and couple the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> to photoperiodic flowering in response to end-of-day light conditions. To better understand their functions, we expressed decoy ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 proteins that associate with target proteins but are unable to ubiquitylate their targets in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). These dominant-negative forms of the proteins inhibit the ubiquitylation of target proteins and allow for the study of ubiquitylation-independent and -dependent functions of ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2. We demonstrate the effects of expressing ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 decoys on the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> and flowering time. Furthermore, the decoy E3 ligases trap substrate interactions, and using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, we identify interacting partners. We focus studies on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> transcription factor CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE) and show that ZTL interacts directly with CHE and can mediate CHE ubiquitylation. We also demonstrate that CHE protein is degraded in the dark and that degradation is reduced in a <i>ztl</i> mutant plant, showing that CHE is a bona fide ZTL target protein. This work increases our understanding of the genetic and biochemical roles for ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 and also demonstrates an effective methodology for studying complicated genetic redundancy among E3 ubiquitin ligases.</p>

The REVEILLE Clock Genes Inhibit Growth of Juvenile and Adult Plants by Control of Cell Size
<p>The circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> is a complex regulatory network that enhances plant growth and fitness in a constantly changing environment. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> is composed of numerous regulatory feedback loops in which <i>REVEILLE8</i> (<i>RVE8</i>) and its homologs <i>RVE4</i> and <i>RVE6</i> act in a partially redundant manner to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> pace. Here, we report that the remaining members of the <i>RVE8</i> clade, <i>RVE3</i> and <i>RVE5</i>, play only minor roles in the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> function. However, we find that RVE8 clade proteins have unexpected functions in the modulation of light input to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> and the control of plant growth at multiple stages of development. In seedlings, these proteins repress hypocotyl elongation in a daylength- and sucrose-dependent manner. Strikingly, adult <i>rve4 6 8</i> and <i>rve3 4 5 6 8</i> mutants are much larger than wild-type plants, with both increased leaf area and biomass. This size phenotype is associated with a faster growth rate and larger cell size and is not simply due to a delay in the transition to flowering. Gene expression and epistasis analysis reveal that the growth phenotypes of <i>rve</i> mutants are due to the misregulation of <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i> (<i>PIF4</i>) and <i>PIF5</i> expression. Our results show that even small changes in <i>PIF</i> gene expression caused by the perturbation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> gene function can have large effects on the growth of adult plants.</p>

Many paths to preserve the body clock
<p>Robust daily oscillations in behavior, physiology, and biochemistry are driven by endogenous timekeeping machinery called the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>s. Circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>s in mammals were originally considered properties of the nervous system, and the anatomical locus of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> was determined to be the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. The neurons that make up this structure are highly interconnected (coupled) and exhibit robust and coordinated rhythms of activity, and loss of rhythmicity results in loss of behavioral rhythms such as daily activity. On page 187 of this issue, Brancaccio <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal that SCNs that have been rendered “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>less” through genetic perturbation in mice can be restored to rhythmicity by rescuing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>s in only the astrocytes, a type of glial cell. The idea that rhythmic astrocytes are sufficient to generate a functional circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> that can control behavioral rhythms is surprising and suggests that the SCN can produce rhythms by means of more than one mechanism.</p>

A Fermi-degenerate three-dimensional optical lattice clock
<p>Strontium optical lattice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>s have the potential to simultaneously interrogate millions of atoms with a high spectroscopic quality factor of 4 × 10<sup>17</sup>. Previously, atomic interactions have forced a compromise between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> stability, which benefits from a large number of atoms, and accuracy, which suffers from density-dependent frequency shifts. Here we demonstrate a scalable solution that takes advantage of the high, correlated density of a degenerate Fermi gas in a three-dimensional (3D) optical lattice to guard against on-site interaction shifts. We show that contact interactions are resolved so that their contribution to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> shifts is orders of magnitude lower than in previous experiments. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synchron</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> comparison between two regions of the 3D lattice yields a measurement precision of 5 × 10<sup>–19</sup> in 1 hour of averaging time.</p>

ZEITLUPE in the Roots of Wild Tobacco Regulates Jasmonate-Mediated Nicotine Biosynthesis and Resistance to a Generalist Herbivore
<p>The jasmonate (JA) phytohormone signaling system is an important mediator of plant defense against herbivores. Plants deficient in JA signaling are more susceptible to herbivory as a result of deficiencies in defensive trait expression. Recent studies have implicated the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> in regulating JA-mediated defenses, but the molecular mechanisms linking the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> to JA signaling are unclear. Here, we report that wild tobacco (<i>Nicotiana attenuata</i>) plants rendered deficient in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> component ZEITLUPE (ZTL) by RNA interference have attenuated resistance to the generalist herbivore <i>Spodoptera littoralis</i>. This effect can be attributed in part to reduced concentrations of nicotine, an abundant JA-regulated toxin produced in <i>N. attenuata</i> roots and transported to shoots. RNA interference targeting ZTL dramatically affects the root circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> and reduces the expression of nicotine biosynthetic genes. Protein-protein interaction experiments demonstrate that ZTL regulates JA signaling by directly interacting with JASMONATE ZIM domain (JAZ) proteins in a CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE1- and jasmonoyl-isoleucine conjugate-independent manner, thereby regulating a JAZ-MYC2 module that is required for nicotine biosynthesis. Our study reveals new functions for ZTL and proposes a mechanism by which a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> component directly influences JA signaling to regulate plant defense against herbivory.</p>

Desynchronization of the molecular clock contributes to the heterogeneity of the inflammatory response
<p>Heterogeneity in the behavior of genetically and developmentally equivalent cells is becoming increasingly appreciated. There are several sources of cellular heterogeneity, including both intrinsic and extrinsic noise. We found that some aspects of heterogeneity in the response of macrophages to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were due to intercellular de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synchron</span></strong>ization of the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>, a cell-intrinsic oscillator.

Cell-autonomous clock of astrocytes drives circadian behavior in mammals
<p>Circadian (~24-hour) rhythms depend on intracellular transcription-translation negative feedback loops (TTFLs). How these self-sustained cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>s achieve multicellular integration and thereby direct daily rhythms of behavior in animals is largely obscure. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the fulcrum of this pathway from gene to cell to circuit to behavior in mammals. We describe cell type–specific, functionally distinct TTFLs in neurons and astrocytes of the SCN and show that, in the absence of other cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>s, the cell-autonomous astrocytic TTFL alone can drive molecular oscillations in the SCN and circadian behavior in mice. Astrocytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>s achieve this by reinstating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> gene expression and circadian function of SCN neurons via glutamatergic signals. Our results demonstrate that astrocytes can autonomously initiate and sustain complex mammalian behavior.</p>

Rev-erbα dynamically modulates chromatin looping to control circadian gene transcription
<p>Mammalian physiology exhibits 24-hour cyclicity due to circadian rhythms of gene expression controlled by transcription factors that constitute molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>s. Core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> transcription factors bind to the genome at enhancer sequences to regulate circadian gene expression, but not all binding sites are equally functional. We found that in mice, circadian gene expression in the liver is controlled by rhythmic chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters. Rev-erbα, a core repressive transcription factor of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>, opposes functional loop formation between Rev-erbα–regulated enhancers and circadian target gene promoters by recruitment of the NCoR-HDAC3 co-repressor complex, histone deacetylation, and eviction of the elongation factor BRD4 and the looping factor MED1. Thus, a repressive arm of the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> operates by rhythmically modulating chromatin loops to control circadian gene transcription.</p>

Circadian, Carbon, and Light Control of Expansion Growth and Leaf Movement
<p>We used Phytotyping<sup>4D</sup> to investigate the contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> and light signaling to the diurnal regulation of rosette expansion growth and leaf movement in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Wild-type plants and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> mutants with a short (<i>lhycca1</i>) and long (<i>prr7prr9</i>) period were analyzed in a T24 cycle and in T-cycles that were closer to the mutants’ period. Wild types also were analyzed in various photoperiods and after transfer to free-running light or darkness. Rosette expansion and leaf movement exhibited a circadian oscillation, with superimposed transients after dawn and dusk. Diurnal responses were modified in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> mutants. <i>lhycca1</i> exhibited an inhibition of growth at the end of night and growth rose earlier after dawn, whereas <i>prr7prr9</i> showed decreased growth for the first part of the light period. Some features were partly rescued by a matching T-cycle, like the inhibition in <i>lhycca1</i> at the end of the night, indicating that it is due to premature exhaustion of starch. Other features were not rescued, revealing that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> also regulates expansion growth more directly. Expansion growth was faster at night than in the daytime, whereas published work has shown that the synthesis of cellular components is faster in the day than at nighttime. This temporal uncoupling became larger in short photoperiods and may reflect the differing dependence of expansion and biosynthesis on energy, carbon, and water. While it has been proposed that leaf expansion and movement are causally linked, we did not observe a consistent temporal relationship between expansion and leaf movement.</p>

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within communities can interact to organize their behavior.

We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm communities undergoing metabolic oscillations can become coupled through electrical signaling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synchron</span></strong>ize their growth dynamics. Coupling increases competition by also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synchron</span></strong>izing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase oscillations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their behavior to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>s drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian oscillator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian oscillator period are thought to adjust the timing of biological activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian oscillator becomes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synchron</span></strong>ized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the dynamic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the dynamic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of biological events. Our data provide insight into how the dynamic period adjustment of circadian oscillators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian oscillator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by stabilizing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian oscillator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the stability of circadian oscillator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

The Chickpea <i>Early Flowering 1</i> (<i>Efl1</i>) Locus Is an Ortholog of Arabidopsis <i>ELF3</i>
<p>In climates that experience short growing seasons due to drought, heat, or end-of-season frost, early flowering is a highly desirable trait for chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). In this study, we mapped, sequenced, and characterized <i>Early flowering3</i> (<i>Efl3</i>), an ortholog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>) that confers early flowering in chickpea. In a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between CDC Frontier and ICCV 96029, this gene was mapped to the site of a quantitative trait locus on Ca5 that explained 59% of flowering time variation under short days. Sequencing of <i>ELF3</i> in ICCV 96029 revealed an 11-bp deletion in the first exon that was predicted to result in a premature stop codon. The effect of this mutation was tested by transgenic complementation in the Arabidopsis <i>elf3-1</i> mutant, with the CDC Frontier form of <i>CaELF3a</i> partially complementing <i>elf3-1</i> while the ICCV 96029 form had no effect on flowering time. While induction of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> homologs was very early in ICCV 96029, an analysis of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> function failed to show any clear loss of rhythm in the expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> genes in ICCV 96029 grown under continuous light, suggesting redundancy with other <i>ELF3</i> homologs or possibly an alternative mode of action for this gene in chickpea. The 11-bp deletion was associated with early flowering in global chickpea germplasm but was not widely distributed, indicating that this mutation arose relatively recently.</p>

Leaf Starch Turnover Occurs in Long Days and in Falling Light at the End of the Day
<p>We investigated whether starch degradation occurs at the same time as starch synthesis in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves in the light. Starch accumulated in a linear fashion for about 12 h after dawn, then accumulation slowed and content plateaued. Following decreases in light intensity, the rate of accumulation of starch declined in proportion to the decline in photosynthesis if the decrease occurred <10 h after dawn, but accumulation ceased or loss of starch occurred if the same decrease in light intensity was imposed more than 10 h after dawn. These changes in starch accumulation patterns after prolonged periods in the light occurred at both high and low starch contents and were not related to time-dependent changes in either the rate of photosynthesis or the partitioning of assimilate between starch and Suc, as assessed from metabolite measurements and <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> pulse experiments. Instead, measurements of incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C from <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> into starch and of levels of the starch degradation product maltose showed that substantial starch degradation occurred simultaneously with synthesis at time points >14 h after dawn and in response to decreases in light intensity that occurred >10 h after dawn. Starch measurements in circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> mutants suggested that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> influences the timing of onset of degradation. We conclude that the propensity for leaf starch to be degraded increases with time after dawn. The importance of this phenomenon for efficient use of carbon for growth in long days and for prevention of starvation during twilight is discussed.</p>

Locked synchronous rotor motion in a molecular motor
<p>Biological molecular motors translate their local directional motion into ordered movement of other parts of the system to empower controlled mechanical functions. The design of analogous geared systems that couple motion in a directional manner, which is pivotal for molecular machinery operating at the nanoscale, remains highly challenging. Here, we report a molecular rotary motor that translates light-driven unidirectional rotary motion to controlled movement of a connected biaryl rotor. Achieving coupled motion of the distinct parts of this multicomponent mechanical system required precise control of multiple kinetic barriers for isomerization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synchron</span></strong>ous motion, resulting in sliding and rotation during a full rotary cycle, with the motor always facing the same face of the rotor.</p>

Lineage-dependent spatial and functional organization of the mammalian enteric nervous system
<p>The enteric nervous system (ENS) is essential for digestive function and gut homeostasis. Here we show that the amorphous neuroglia networks of the mouse ENS are composed of overlapping clonal units founded by postmigratory neural crest–derived progenitors. The spatial configuration of ENS clones depends on proliferation-driven local interactions of ENS progenitors with lineally unrelated neuroectodermal cells, the ordered colonization of the serosa-mucosa axis by clonal descendants, and gut expansion. Single-cell transcriptomics and mutagenesis analysis delineated dynamic molecular states of ENS progenitors and identified RET as a regulator of neurogenic commitment. Clonally related enteric neurons exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synchron</span></strong>ous activity in response to network stimulation. Thus, lineage relationships underpin the organization of the peripheral nervous system.</p>

Superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex replay independently of the hippocampus
<p>The hippocampus is thought to initiate systems-wide mnemonic processes through the reactivation of previously acquired spatial and episodic memory traces, which can recruit the entorhinal cortex as a first stage of memory redistribution to other brain areas. Hippocampal reactivation occurs during sharp wave–ripples, in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synchron</span></strong>ous network firing encodes sequences of places. We investigated the coordination of this replay by recording assembly activity simultaneously in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex. We found that entorhinal cell assemblies can replay trajectories independently of the hippocampus and sharp wave–ripples. This suggests that the hippocampus is not the sole initiator of spatial and episodic memory trace reactivation. Memory systems involved in these processes may include nonhierarchical, parallel components.</p>

Why does time seem to fly when we're having fun?
<p>Animals use the neurotransmitter dopamine to encode the relationship between their responses and reward. Reinforcement learning theory (<i>1</i>) successfully explains the role of phasic bursts of dopamine in terms of future reward maximization. Yet, dopamine clearly plays other roles in shaping behavior that have no obvious relationship to reinforcement learning, including modulating the rate at which our subjective sense of time grows in real time. On page 1273 of this issue, Soares <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) closely examine the role of dopamine in mice performing a task in which they keep track of the time between two events and make decisions about this temporal duration. The results suggest the need to reassess the leading theory of dopamine function in timing—the dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> hypothesis (<i>3</i>). They may also help explain empirical phenomena that challenge the reinforcement learning account of dopamine function.</p>

Selective modulation of cortical state during spatial attention

These On-Off dynamics, reflecting global changes in cortical state, were also modulated at a local scale during selective attention.

Photoactivation and inactivation of <i>Arabidopsis</i> cryptochrome 2

We found that <i>Arabidopsis</i> cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) undergoes blue light–dependent homodimerization to become physiologically active. We identified BIC1 (blue-light inhibitor of cryptochromes 1) as an inhibitor of plant cryptochromes that binds to CRY2 to suppress the blue light–dependent dimerization, photobody formation, phosphorylation, degradation, and physiological activities of CRY2. We hypothesize that regulated dimerization governs homeostasis of the active cryptochromes in plants and other evolutionary lineages.</p>

Pivotal Roles of Cryptochromes 1a and 2 in Tomato Development and Physiology
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-containing blue/UVA light photoreceptors that regulate various plant light-induced physiological processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), cryptochromes mediate de-etiolation, photoperiodic control of flowering, entrainment of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>, cotyledon opening and expansion, anthocyanin accumulation, and root growth. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), cryptochromes are encoded by a multigene family, comprising <i>CRY1a</i>, <i>CRY1b</i>, <i>CRY2</i>, and <i>CRY3</i>. We have previously reported the phenotypes of tomato <i>cry1a</i> mutants and <i>CRY2</i> overexpressing plants. Here, we report the isolation by targeting induced local lesions in genomes, of a tomato <i>cry2</i> knock-out mutant, its introgression in the indeterminate Moneymaker background, and the phenotypes of <i>cry1a</i>/<i>cry2</i> single and double mutants. The <i>cry1a</i>/<i>cry2</i> mutant showed phenotypes similar to its Arabidopsis counterpart (long hypocotyls in white and blue light), but also several additional features such as increased seed weight and internode length, enhanced hypocotyl length in red light, inhibited primary root growth under different light conditions, anticipation of flowering under long-day conditions, and alteration of the phase of circadian leaf movements. Both cry1a and cry2 control the levels of photosynthetic pigments in leaves, but cry2 has a predominant role in fruit pigmentation. Metabolites of the sterol, tocopherol, quinone, and sugar classes are differentially accumulated in <i>cry1a</i> and <i>cry2</i> leaves and fruits. These results demonstrate a pivotal role of cryptochromes in controlling tomato development and physiology. The manipulation of these photoreceptors represents a powerful tool to influence important agronomic traits such as flowering time and fruit quality.</p>

Time-Course Transcriptome Analysis of Arabidopsis Siliques Discloses Genes Essential for Fruit Development and Maturation
<p>Fruits protect the developing seeds of angiosperms and actively contribute to seed dispersion. Furthermore, fruit and seed development are highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synchron</span></strong>ized and require exchange of information between the mother plant and the developing generations. To explore the mechanisms controlling fruit formation and maturation, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the valve tissue of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) silique using RNA sequencing. In doing so, we have generated a data set of differentially regulated genes that will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underpin the initial phase of fruit growth and, subsequently, trigger fruit maturation. The robustness of our data set has been tested by functional genomic studies. Using a reverse genetics approach, we selected 10 differentially expressed genes and explored the consequences of their disruption for both silique growth and senescence. We found that genes contained in our data set play essential roles in different stages of silique development and maturation, indicating that our transcriptome-based gene list is a powerful tool for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms controlling fruit formation in Arabidopsis.</p>

Specialized Plastids Trigger Tissue-Specific Signaling for Systemic Stress Response in Plants
<p>Plastids comprise a complex set of organelles in plants that can undergo distinctive patterns of differentiation and redifferentiation during their lifespan. Plastids localized to the epidermis and vascular parenchyma are distinctive in size, structural features, and functions. These plastids are termed “sensory” plastids, and here we show their proteome to be distinct from chloroplasts, with specialized stress-associated features. The distinctive sensory plastid proteome in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) derives from spatiotemporal regulation of nuclear genes encoding plastid-targeted proteins. Perturbation caused by depletion of the sensory plastid-specific protein MutS HOMOLOG1 conditioned local, programmed changes in gene networks controlling chromatin, stress-related phytohormone, and circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> behavior and producing a global, systemic stress response in the plant.

Inhibition of TOR Represses Nutrient Consumption, Which Improves Greening after Extended Periods of Etiolation
<p>Upon illumination, etiolated seedlings experience a transition from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic growth. During this process, the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway provides chlorophyll for photosynthesis. This pathway has to be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of photoreactive metabolites and to provide stoichiometric amounts of chlorophyll for its incorporation into photosynthetic protein complexes. Therefore, plants have evolved regulatory mechanisms to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synchron</span></strong>ize the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and chlorophyll-binding proteins. Two phytochrome-interacting factors (PIF1 and PIF3) and the DELLA proteins, which are controlled by the gibberellin pathway, are key regulators of this process. Here, we show that impairment of TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), either by mutation of the TOR complex component <i>RAPTOR1B</i> or by treatment with TOR inhibitors, leads to a significantly reduced accumulation of the photoreactive chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide in darkness but an increased greening rate of etiolated seedlings after exposure to light. Detailed profiling of metabolic, transcriptomic, and physiological parameters revealed that the TOR-repressed lines not only grow slower, they grow in a nutrient-saving mode, which allows them to resist longer periods of low nutrient availability. Our results also indicated that <i>RAPTOR1B</i> acts upstream of the gibberellin-DELLA pathway and its mutation complements the repressed greening phenotype of <i>pif1</i> and <i>pif3</i> after etiolation.</p>

Stage-Specific Gene Profiling of Germinal Cells Helps Delineate the Mitosis/Meiosis Transition
<p>In flowering plants, germ lines are induced from somatic meristems within reproductive organs. Within anthers, germinal cell initials first undergo several rounds of mitotic proliferation before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synchron</span></strong>ously entering meiosis. Our understanding of the progression and the molecular basis of this mitosis to meiosis transition is still limited. Taking advantage of the correlation between anther length and premeiotic germinal cell development in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we studied the transcriptome dynamics of germinal cells at three sequential stages, mitotic archesporial cells, enlarging pollen mother cells at the premeiosis interphase, and pollen mother cells at the early prophase of meiosis, using laser microdissection-based expression profiling. Our analysis showed that cells undergoing the mitosis-meiosis switch exhibit robust transcriptional changes. The three stages are distinguished by the expression of genes encoding transcription factor subsets, meiotic chromosome recombination proteins, and distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, respectively. The transcription level of genes encoding protein turnover machinery was significantly higher in these three stages of germinal cells than in mature pollen, parenchyma cells, or seedlings. Our experimental results further indicate that many meiotic genes are not only transcribed, but also translated prior to meiosis. We suggest that the enlarging pollen mother cells stage represents a crucial turning point from mitosis to meiosis for developing germinal cells.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average plant oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

LNK1 and LNK2 Corepressors Interact with the MYB3 Transcription Factor in Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Subgroup 4 of R2R3-MYB transcription factors consists of four members, MYB3, MYB4, MYB7, and MYB32, which possess the conserved EAR repression motif (pdLHLD/LLxiG/S) in their C termini. Here, we show that MYB3 is a newly identified repressor in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. However, the repression mechanism of MYB3 is completely different from MYB4, MYB7, and MYB32. Yeast two-hybrid screening using MYB3 as a bait isolates NIGHT LIGHT-INDUCIBLE AND CLOCK-REGULATED1 (LNK1) and LNK2, members of a small family of four LNK proteins. The repression activity of MYB3 to cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (<i>C4H</i>) gene expression is directly regulated by corepressors LNK1 and LNK2, which could facilitate binding of MYB3 with <i>C4H</i> promoter. The two conserved Asp residues in both region 1 and 2 domain of LNKs are essential to mediate protein-protein interaction. Importantly, the Extra N-terminal Tail domain plays a negative role in LNK-MYB3 transcription complex-dependent repression of the <i>C4H</i> gene. We conclude that LNK1 and LNK2 act as transcriptional corepressors necessary for expression of the phenylpropanoids biosynthesis gene <i>C4H</i> through recruitment to its promoter via interaction with MYB3.</p>

Night-Break Experiments Shed Light on the Photoperiod1-Mediated Flowering
<p>Plants utilize variation in day length (photoperiod) to anticipate seasonal changes. They respond by modulating their growth and development to maximize seed production, which in cereal crops is directly related to yield. In wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), the acceleration of flowering under long days (LD) is dependent on the light induction of <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>PPD1</i>) by phytochromes. Under LD, <i>PPD1</i> activates <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> (<i>FT1</i>), a mobile signaling protein that travels from the leaves to the shoot apical meristem to promote flowering. Here, we show that the interruption of long nights by short pulses of light (“night-break” [NB]) accelerates wheat flowering, suggesting that the duration of the night is critical for wheat photoperiodic response. <i>PPD1</i> transcription was rapidly upregulated by NBs, and the magnitude of this induction increased with the length of darkness preceding the NB. Cycloheximide abolished the NB up-regulation of <i>PPD1</i>, suggesting that this process is dependent on active protein synthesis during darkness. While one NB was sufficient to induce <i>PPD1</i>, more than 15 NBs were required to induce high levels of <i>FT1</i> expression and a strong acceleration of flowering. Multiple NBs did not affect the expression of core circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> genes. The acceleration of flowering by NB disappeared in <i>ppd1-</i>null mutants, demonstrating that this response is mediated by <i>PPD1</i>. The acceleration of flowering was strongest when NBs were applied in the middle of the night, suggesting that in addition to <i>PPD1</i>, other circadian-controlled factors are required for the up-regulation of <i>FT1</i> expression and the acceleration of flowering.</p>

A Plant Cryptochrome Controls Key Features of the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Circadian Clock and Its Life Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-binding proteins that act as blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects and are components of the circadian oscillator in mammals. Animal and plant cryptochromes are evolutionarily divergent, although the unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas</i> throughout) has both an animal-like cryptochrome and a plant cryptochrome (pCRY; formerly designated CPH1). Here, we show that the pCRY protein accumulates at night as part of a complex. Functional characterization of pCRY was performed based on an insertional mutant that expresses only 11% of the wild-type pCRY level. The <i>pcry</i> mutant is defective for central properties of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>. In the mutant, the period is lengthened significantly, ultimately resulting in arrhythmicity, while blue light-based phase shifts show large deviations from what is observed in wild-type cells. We also show that pCRY is involved in gametogenesis in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. pCRY is down-regulated in pregametes and gametes, and in the <i>pcry</i> mutant, there is altered transcript accumulation under blue light of the strictly light-dependent, gamete-specific gene <i>GAS28</i>. pCRY acts as a negative regulator for the induction of mating ability in the light and for the loss of mating ability in the dark. Moreover, pCRY is necessary for light-dependent germination, during which the zygote undergoes meiosis that gives rise to four vegetative cells. In sum, our data demonstrate that pCRY is a key blue light receptor in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> that is involved in both circadian timing and life cycle progression.</p>

Light Controls Cytokinin Signaling via Transcriptional Regulation of Constitutively Active Sensor Histidine Kinase CKI1
<p>In plants, the multistep phosphorelay (MSP) pathway mediates a range of regulatory processes, including those activated by cytokinins. The cross talk between cytokinin response and light has been known for a long time. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between light and cytokinin signaling remains elusive. In the screen for upstream regulators we identified a <i>LONG PALE HYPOCOTYL</i> (<i>LPH</i>) gene whose activity is indispensable for spatiotemporally correct expression of <i>CYTOKININ INDEPENDENT1</i> (<i>CKI1</i>), encoding the constitutively active sensor His kinase that activates MSP signaling. <i>lph</i> is a new allele of <i>HEME OXYGENASE1</i> (<i>HY1</i>) that encodes the key protein in the biosynthesis of phytochromobilin, a cofactor of photoconvertible phytochromes. Our analysis confirmed the light-dependent regulation of the <i>CKI1</i> expression pattern. We show that <i>CKI1</i> expression is under the control of phytochrome A (phyA), functioning as a dual (both positive and negative) regulator of <i>CKI1</i> expression, presumably via the phyA-regulated transcription factors (TF) PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1. Changes in <i>CKI1</i> expression observed in <i>lph</i>/<i>hy1</i>-<i>7</i> and <i>phy</i> mutants correlate with misregulation of MSP signaling, changed cytokinin sensitivity, and developmental aberrations that were previously shown to be associated with cytokinin and/or CKI1 action. Besides that, we demonstrate a novel role of phyA-dependent <i>CKI1</i> expression in the hypocotyl elongation and hook development during skotomorphogenesis. Based on these results, we propose that the light-dependent regulation of <i>CKI1</i> provides a plausible mechanistic link underlying the well-known interaction between light- and cytokinin-controlled plant development.</p>

<i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> Redundancy Fine-Tunes Photoperiod Sensitivity
<p>Three pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) loci controlling photoperiod sensitivity, <i>HIGH RESPONSE</i> (<i>HR</i>), <i>DIE NEUTRALIS</i> (<i>DNE</i>), and <i>STERILE NODES</i> (<i>SN</i>), have recently been shown to correspond to orthologs of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> genes <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>), <i>ELF4</i>, and <i>LUX ARRHYTHMO</i>, respectively.

However, the molecular identity of <i>PPD</i> has so far remained elusive. Here, we show that the <i>PPD</i> locus also has a role in maintenance of diurnal and circadian gene expression rhythms and identify <i>PPD</i> as an <i>ELF3</i> co-ortholog, termed <i>ELF3b</i>. Genetic interactions between pea <i>ELF3</i> genes suggest that loss of <i>PPD</i> function does not affect flowering time in the presence of functional <i>HR</i>, whereas <i>PPD</i> can compensate only partially for the lack of <i>HR</i>. These results provide an illustration of how gene duplication and divergence can generate potential for the emergence of more subtle variations in phenotype that may be adaptively significant.</p>

Correlations between Circadian Rhythms and Growth in Challenging Environments
<p>In plants, the circadian system controls a plethora of processes, many with agronomic importance, such as photosynthesis, photoprotection, stomatal opening, and photoperiodic development, as well as molecular processes, such as gene expression. It has been suggested that modifying circadian rhythms may be a means to manipulate crops to develop improved plants for agriculture. However, there is very little information on how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> influences the performance of crop plants. We used a noninvasive, high-throughput technique, based on prompt chlorophyll fluorescence, to measure circadian rhythms and demonstrated that the technique works in a range of plants. Using fluorescence, we analyzed circadian rhythms in populations of wild barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> ssp. <i>spontaneum</i>) from widely different ecogeographical locations in the Southern Levant part of the Fertile Crescent, an area with a high proportion of the total genetic variation of wild barley. Our results show that there is variability for circadian traits in the wild barley lines. We observed that circadian period lengths were correlated with temperature and aspect at the sites of origin of the plants, while the amplitudes of the rhythms were correlated with soil composition. Thus, different environmental parameters may exert selection on circadian rhythms.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient temperature has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong> genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient temperature in barley.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p>Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation’s effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clock</span></strong>. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational effects on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

Cool by neuronal decision
<p>Inside the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-protected and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-ventilated human skull, the temperature of a few hundred thousand neurons can deviate by several degrees centigrade from that of the surrounding 100 billion or so cells. These cells constitute around 15% of the neurons in the brain's preoptic area (POA) and can change their firing rate dramatically upon a 1° to 3°C change in local temperature (<i>1</i>). Astoundingly, this change in activity can alter the body's core temperature. Cellular and molecular details of the warm and cold sensitivity of these neurons are not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> understood. Although the induction of fever has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> studied, the mechanisms that terminate fever are not yet clear. On page 1393 of this issue, Song <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report that a transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel (<i>3</i>, <i>4</i>) is key to the function of these neurons in thermoregulation, particularly in response to fever.</p>

The spatial footprint of injection wells in a global compilation of induced earthquake sequences
<p>Fluid injection can cause extensive earthquake activity, sometimes at unexpectedly large distances. Appropriately mitigating associated seismic hazards requires a better understanding of the zone of influence of injection. We analyze spatial seismicity decay in a global dataset of 18 induced cases with clear association between isolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>s and earthquakes. We distinguish two populations. The first is characterized by near-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> seismicity density plateaus and abrupt decay, dominated by square-root space-time migration and pressure diffusion. Injection at these sites occurs within the crystalline basement. The second population exhibits larger spatial footprints and magnitudes, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as a power law–like, steady spatial decay over more than 10 kilometers, potentially caused by poroelastic effects. Far-reaching spatial effects during injection may increase event magnitudes and seismic hazard beyond expectations based on purely pressure-driven seismicity.</p>

CYP79D73 Participates in Biosynthesis of Floral Scent Compound 2-Phenylethanol in <i>Plumeria rubra</i>
<p>Plumeria (<i>Plumeria rubra</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> known for its brightly colored and fragrant flowers, emits a number of floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Plumeria flowers emit a total of 43 VOCs including nine phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, such as 2-phenylethanol (2PE), benzaldehyde, 2-phenylacetaldehyde (PAld), (<i>E/Z</i>)<i>-</i>phenylacetaldoxime (PAOx), benzyl nitrile (BN), and 2-phenylnitroethane (PN). To identify genes and pathways involved in the production of the major compound 2PE, we analyzed the plumeria floral transcriptome and found a highly expressed, flower-specific gene encoding a cytochrome P450 family 79D protein (PrCYP79D73), which catalyzed the formation of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx. Feeding experiments with deuterated phenylalanine or deuterated (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx showed that (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 2PE, as are two nitrogen-containing volatiles, BN and PN, in plumeria flowers. Crude enzyme extracts from plumeria flowers converted <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx, PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN. The biosynthesis of these compounds increased with addition of PrCYP79D73-enriched microsomes but was blocked by pretreatment with 4-phenylimidazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Moreover, overexpression of <i>PrCYP79D73</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> resulted in the emission of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN, all of which were also found among plumeria floral VOCs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PrCYP79D73 is a crucial player in the biosynthesis of the major floral VOC 2PE and other nitrogen-containing volatiles. These volatiles may be required for plant defense as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as to attract pollinators for the successful reproduction of plumeria.</p>

A macrophage relay for long-distance signaling during postembryonic tissue remodeling
<p>Macrophages have diverse functions in immunity as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as in development and homeostasis. We identified a function for these cells in long-distance communication during postembryonic tissue remodeling. Ablation of macrophages in zebrafish prevented melanophores from coalescing into adult pigment stripes. Melanophore organization depends on signals provided by cells of the yellow xanthophore lineage via airinemes, long filamentous projections with vesicles at their tips. We show that airineme extension from originating cells, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as vesicle deposition on target cells, depend on interactions with macrophages. These findings identify a role for macrophages in relaying long-range signals between nonimmune cells. This signaling modality may function in the remodeling and homeostasis of other tissues during normal development and disease.</p>

Extremely efficient internal exciton dissociation through edge states in layered 2D perovskites

Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites are solution-processed quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>s wherein the band gap can be tuned by varying the perovskite-layer thickness, which modulates the effective electron-hole confinement. We report that, counterintuitive to classical quantum-confined systems where photogenerated electrons and holes are strongly bound by Coulomb interactions or excitons, the photophysics of thin films made of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a thickness exceeding two perovskite-crystal units (>1.3 nanometers) is dominated by lower-energy states associated with the local intrinsic electronic structure of the edges of the perovskite layers. These states provide a direct pathway for dissociating excitons into longer-lived free carriers that substantially improve the performance of optoelectronic devices.</p>

Holographic description of a quantum black hole on a computer
<p>Black holes have been predicted to radiate particles and eventually evaporate, which has led to the information loss paradox and implies that the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics may be violated. Superstring theory, a consistent theory of quantum gravity, provides a possible solution to the paradox if evaporating black holes can actually be described in terms of standard quantum mechanical systems, as conjectured from the theory. Here, we test this conjecture by calculating the mass of a black hole in the corresponding quantum mechanical system numerically. Our results agree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> with the prediction from gravity theory, including the leading quantum gravity correction. Our ability to simulate black holes offers the potential to further explore the yet mysterious nature of quantum gravity through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-established quantum mechanics.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)
<sec><title>Vibrating Water Apart</title><p>The main route for producing hydrogen for industrial chemical synthesis is steam reforming, in which water and methane react at high temperatures on nickel catalysts to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

A Histone Acetylation Switch Regulates H2A.Z Deposition by the SWR-C Remodeling Enzyme
<sec><title>Variants and Regulation</title><p>Genomic DNA is packaged into nucleosomes by spooling around histone proteins. Histone variants and the composition of nucleosomes can influence gene expression, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as other chromatin-mediated processes.

3D Imaging of Tapetal Mitochondria Suggests the Importance of Mitochondrial Fission in Pollen Growth
<p>Mitochondrial fission occurs frequently in plant cells, but its biological significance is poorly understood because mutants specifically impaired in mitochondrial fission do not show obvious defects in vegetative growth. Here, we revealed that the production of viable pollen was reduced in mutants lacking one of the three main proteins involved in mitochondrial fission in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3A (DRP3A)/Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-LIKE PROTEIN2A, DRP3B, and ELONGATED MITOCHONDRIA1 (ELM1). In <i>drp3b</i> and <i>elm1</i>, young microspores contained an abnormal number of nuclei, and mature pollen had aberrant accumulation of lipids in their coat and an irregular pollen outer wall. Because the formation of the pollen wall and coat is mainly associated with tapetal function, we used 3D imaging to quantify geometric and textural features of cells and mitochondria in the tapetum at different stages, using isolated single tapetal cells in which the in vivo morphology and volume of cells and mitochondria were preserved. Tapetal cells and their mitochondria changed in the volume and morphology at different developmental stages. Defective mitochondrial fission in the <i>elm1</i> and <i>drp3b</i> mutants caused changes in mitochondrial status, including mitochondrial elongation, abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure, a decrease in cross-sectional area, and a slight alteration of mitochondrial distribution, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as a large reduction in mitochondrial density. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial fission is required for proper mitochondrial status in the tapetum and possibly in pollen as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> and therefore plays an important role for the production of viable pollen.</p>

Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse polar behaviors in response to directional and nondirectional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic behaviors is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> understood, but it is less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the polarity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally programmed polarity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in polarization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf polarity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and polar transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of polar auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental programming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

Evolution of Cold Acclimation and Its Role in Niche Transition in the Temperate Grass Subfamily Pooideae
<p>The grass subfamily Pooideae dominates the grass floras in cold temperate regions and has evolved complex physiological adaptations to cope with extreme environmental conditions like frost, winter, and seasonality. One such adaptation is cold acclimation, wherein plants increase their frost tolerance in response to gradually falling temperatures and shorter days in the autumn. However, understanding how complex traits like cold acclimation evolve remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigated the evolution of cold acclimation in Pooideae and found that a phylogenetically diverse set of Pooideae species displayed cold acclimation capacity. However, comparing differential gene expression after cold treatment in transcriptomes of five phylogenetically diverse species revealed widespread species-specific responses of genes with conserved sequences. Furthermore, we studied the correlation between gene family size and number of cold-responsive genes as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as between selection pressure on coding sequences of genes and their cold responsiveness. We saw evidence of protein-coding and regulatory sequence evolution as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as the origin of novel genes and functions contributing toward evolution of a cold response in Pooideae. Our results reflect that selection pressure resulting from global cooling must have acted on already diverged lineages. Nevertheless, conservation of cold-induced gene expression of certain genes indicates that the Pooideae ancestor may have possessed some molecular machinery to mitigate cold stress. Evolution of adaptations to seasonally cold climates is regarded as particularly difficult. How Pooideae evolved to transition from tropical to temperate biomes sheds light on how complex traits evolve in the light of climate changes.</p>

Phosphate Starvation Alters Abiotic-Stress-Induced Cytosolic Free Calcium Increases in Roots
<p>Phosphate (Pi) deficiency strongly limits plant growth, and plant roots foraging the soil for nutrients need to adapt to optimize Pi uptake. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is known to signal in root development and adaptation but has to be tightly controlled, as it is highly toxic to Pi metabolism. Under Pi starvation and the resulting decreased cellular Pi pool, the use of cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) as a signal transducer may therefore have to be altered. Employing aequorin-expressing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we show that Pi starvation, but not nitrogen starvation, strongly dampens the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> increases evoked by mechanical, salt, osmotic, and oxidative stress as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as by extracellular nucleotides. The altered root [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response to extracellular ATP manifests during seedling development under chronic Pi deprivation but can be reversed by Pi resupply. Employing ratiometric imaging, we delineate that Pi-starved roots have a normal response to extracellular ATP at the apex but show a strongly dampened [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response in distal parts of the root tip, correlating with high reactive oxygen species levels induced by Pi starvation. Excluding iron, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as Pi, rescues this altered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response and restores reactive oxygen species levels to those seen under nutrient-replete conditions. These results indicate that, while Pi availability does not seem to be signaled through [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>, Pi starvation strongly affects stress-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> signatures. These data reveal how plants can integrate nutritional and environmental cues, adding another layer of complexity to the use of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a signal transducer.</p>

Hydraulics Regulate Stomatal Responses to Changes in Leaf Water Status in the Fern <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>
<p>Stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status are important for the diurnal regulation of gas exchange and the survival of plants during drought. These stomatal responses in angiosperm species are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> characterized, yet in species of nonseed plants, an ongoing debate surrounds the role of metabolism, particularly the role of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), in functionally regulating stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status. Here, we measured the stomatal response to changes in vapor pressure difference (VPD) in two natural forms of the fern species <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>, recently suggested to have stomata that are regulated by ABA. The two forms measured had considerable differences in key hydraulic traits, including leaf hydraulic conductance and capacitance, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as the kinetics of stomatal response to changes in VPD. In both forms, the stomatal responses to VPD could be accurately predicted by a dynamic, mechanistic model that assumes guard cell turgor changes in concert with leaf turgor in the light, and not via metabolic processes including the level of ABA. During drought, endogenous ABA did not play a role in stomatal closure, and exogenous ABA applied to live, intact leaves did not induce stomatal closure. Our results indicate that functional stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status in ferns are regulated by leaf hydraulics and not metabolism. With ferns being sister to seed plants, this result has implications for the evolutionary reconstruction of functional stomatal responses across vascular land plant lineages.</p>

Roles of RbcX in Carboxysome Biosynthesis in the Cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942
<p>Rubisco is the essential enzyme mediating the fixation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during photosynthesis.

Numerous chaperone proteins, including RbcX, are essential for proper protein folding and Rubisco assembly. In this study, we investigated the in vivo function of RbcX in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942 (Syn7942) using molecular, biochemical, and live-cell fluorescence imaging approaches. Our results show that genetic deletion of the <i>rbcX</i> gene affects Rubisco abundance, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as carboxysome formation and spatial distribution. Moreover, RbcX appears as one component of the carboxysome and shows a dynamic interaction with Rubisco enzymes.

Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying Rubisco assembly and carboxysome biogenesis will provide essential information required for engineering functional CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing complexes in heterogeneous organisms, especially plants, with the aim of boosting photosynthesis and agricultural productivity.</p>

Chlorophyll fluorescence vitality index Rfd was determined as the earliest parameter that correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> with the cessation of photosynthesis prior to microautophagy symptoms, initiation of DNA degradation, and severalfold increase in the endonuclease <i>BNUC1.</i> DILS was found characterized by up-regulation of processes that enable recycling of degraded macromolecules and metabolites, including increased NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> remobilization, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and partial up-regulation of glyoxylate and tricarboxylate acid cycles. The most evident differences in gene medleys between DILS and developmental senescence included hormone-activated signaling pathways, lipid catabolic processes, carbohydrate metabolic processes, low-affinity ammonia remobilization, and RNA methylation. The mega-autophagy symptoms were apparent much later, specifically on day 10 of DILS, when disruption of organelles—nucleus and mitochondria —became evident. Also, during this latter-stage programmed cell death processes, namely, shrinking of the protoplast, tonoplast interruption, and vacuole breakdown, chromatin condensation, more DNA fragmentation, and disintegration of the cell membrane were prominent. Reversal of DILS by re-exposure of the plants from dark to light was possible until but not later than day 7 of dark exposure and was accompanied by regained photosynthesis, increase in chlorophyll, and reversal of Rfd, despite activation of macro-autophagy-related genes.</p>

Carbonic Anhydrase Mutants in <i>Zea mays</i> Have Altered Stomatal Responses to Environmental Signals
<p>Stomata regulate transpirational water loss and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis in response to changing environmental conditions. Research investigating stomatal movement has mostly been conducted in C<sub>3</sub> eudicot species, which have very different CO<sub>2</sub> requirements for photosynthesis relative to C<sub>4</sub> grasses. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub>, and its activity has been linked to stomatal aperture regulation in eudicots. The number of <i>Ca</i> genes and their evolutionary history differ between monocots and dicots, and many questions remain unanswered about potential neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization of grass <i>Ca</i> paralogs and their roles in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. To investigate the roles of different <i>Ca</i> genes in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we examined stomatal responses in <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as a <i>ca1ca2</i> double mutant. The <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants had 10% and 87% of the CA activity exhibited by the wild type, respectively, while <i>ca1ca2</i> had less than 5% of wild-type CA activity. The <i>ca</i> mutants had higher stomatal conductance than the wild type and slower stomatal closure in response to increases in CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure. Contrary to previous reports in eudicots, <i>ca</i> mutants showed slowed stomatal closure in response to the light-dark transition and did not show differences in stomatal density compared with the wild type. These results implicate CA-mediated signaling in the control of stomatal movement but not stomatal development. Drought experiments with <i>ca1ca2</i> mutant plants suggest a role for CA in water-use efficiency and reveal that <i>Z. mays</i> is not optimized for water-use efficiency under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-watered conditions.</p>

Pausing of Chloroplast Ribosomes Is Induced by Multiple Features and Is Linked to the Assembly of Photosynthetic Complexes<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many mRNAs contain pause sites that briefly interrupt the progress of translation. Specific features that induce ribosome pausing have been described; however, their individual contributions to pause-site formation, and the overall biological significance of ribosome pausing, remain largely unclear. We have taken advantage of the compact genome of chloroplasts to carry out a plastid genome-wide survey of pause sites, as a basis for studying the impact of pausing on posttranslational processes. Based on ribosomal profiling of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) chloroplast mRNAs, we demonstrate that a combination of factors—mRNA secondary structure, internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and positively charged amino acids in the nascent peptide chain—explains 95% of the major pause sites on plastid mRNAs, whereas codon usage has little impact. The distribution of the pause sites is nonrandom and conforms to distinct patterns in the vicinity of sequences coding for transmembrane domains, which depend on their orientation within the membrane as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as being next to sequences coding for cofactor binding sites. We found strong indications that the mechanisms causing ribosomal pausing and at least some of the ribosomes pause sites are conserved between distantly related plant species. In addition, the positions of features that cause pausing are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> conserved in photoautotrophic plants, but less so in their nonphotosynthetic, parasitic relatives, implying that the synthesis and assembly of photosynthetic multiprotein complexes requires localized ribosome pausing.</p>

Stomatal VPD Response: There Is More to the Story Than ABA
<p>Guard cells shrink and close stomatal pores when air humidity decreases (i.e. when the difference between the vapor pressures of leaf and atmosphere [VPD] increases). The role of abscisic acid (ABA) in VPD-induced stomatal closure has been studied using ABA-related mutants that respond to VPD in some studies and not in others. The importance of ABA biosynthesis in guard cells versus vasculature for whole-plant stomatal regulation is unclear as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines carrying mutations in different steps of ABA biosynthesis as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <i>wilty</i> and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>flacca</i> ABA-deficient mutants had higher stomatal conductance compared with wild-type plants. To characterize the role of ABA production in different cells, we generated transgenic plants where ABA biosynthesis was rescued in guard cells or phloem companion cells of an ABA-deficient mutant. In both cases, the whole-plant stomatal conductance, stunted growth phenotype, and leaf ABA level were restored to wild-type values, pointing to the redundancy of ABA sources and to the effectiveness of leaf ABA transport. All ABA-deficient lines closed their stomata rapidly and extensively in response to high VPD, whereas plants with mutated protein kinase OST1 showed stunted VPD-induced responses. Another strongly ABA-insensitive mutant, defective in the six ABA PYR/RCAR receptors, responded to changes in VPD in both directions strongly and symmetrically, indicating that its VPD-induced closure could be passive hydraulic. We discuss that both the VPD-induced passive hydraulic stomatal closure and the stomatal VPD regulation of ABA-deficient mutants may be conditional on the initial pretreatment stomatal conductance.</p>

Arabidopsis Novel Glycine-Rich Plasma Membrane PSS1 Protein Enhances Disease Resistance in Transgenic Soybean Plants
<p>Nonhost resistance is defined as the immunity of a plant species to all nonadapted pathogen species. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ecotype Columbia-0 is nonhost to the oomycete plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> and the fungal plant pathogen <i>Fusarium virguliforme</i> that are pathogenic to soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>). Previously, we reported generating the <i>pss1</i> mutation in the <i>pen1-1</i> genetic background as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as genetic mapping and characterization of the Arabidopsis nonhost resistance <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>-susceptible gene locus, <i>PSS1</i>. In this study, we identified six candidate <i>PSS1</i> genes by comparing single-nucleotide polymorphisms of (1) the bulked DNA sample of seven F<sub>2:3</sub> families homozygous for the <i>pss1</i> allele and (2) the <i>pen1-1</i> mutant with Columbia-0. Analyses of T-DNA insertion mutants for each of these candidate <i>PSS1</i> genes identified the <i>At3g59640</i> gene encoding a glycine-rich protein as the putative <i>PSS1</i> gene. Later, complementation analysis confirmed the identity of <i>At3g59640</i> as the <i>PSS1</i> gene. <i>PSS1</i> is induced following <i>P. sojae</i> infection as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as expressed in an organ-specific manner. Coexpression analysis of the available transcriptomic data followed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction suggested that <i>PSS1</i> is coregulated with <i>ATG8a</i> (<i>At4g21980</i>), a core gene in autophagy. PSS1 contains a predicted single membrane-spanning domain. Subcellular localization study indicated that it is an integral plasma membrane protein. Sequence analysis suggested that soybean is unlikely to contain a PSS1-like defense function. Following the introduction of <i>PSS1</i> into the soybean cultivar Williams 82, the transgenic plants exhibited enhanced resistance to <i>F. virguliforme</i>, the pathogen that causes sudden death syndrome.</p>

In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the stress and ABA-induced Δ1-PYRROLINE-5-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHETASE1 (<i>P5CS1</i>) gene was previously shown to control Pro biosynthesis in such adverse conditions. To identify regulatory factors that control the transcription of <i>P5CS1</i>, Y1H screens were performed with a genomic fragment of <i>P5CS1</i>, containing 1.2-kB promoter and 0.8-kb transcribed regions. The myeloblastosis (MYB)-type transcription factors PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) and PHR1-LIKE1 (PHL1) were identified to bind to <i>P5CS1</i> regulatory sequences in the first intron, which carries a conserved PHR1-binding site (P1BS) motif. Binding of PHR1 and PHL1 factors to P1BS was confirmed by Y1H, electrophoretic mobility assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Phosphate starvation led to gradual increase in Pro content in wild-type Arabidopsis plants as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as transcriptional activation of <i>P5CS1</i> and PRO DEHYDROGENASE2 genes. Induction of <i>P5CS1</i> transcription and Pro accumulation during phosphate deficiency was considerably reduced by <i>phr1</i> and <i>phl1</i> mutations and was impaired in the ABA-deficient <i>aba2-3</i> and ABA-insensitive <i>abi4-1</i> mutants. Growth and viability of <i>phr1phl1</i> double mutant was significantly reduced in phosphate-depleted medium, while growth was only marginally affected in the <i>aba2-3</i> mutants, suggesting that ABA is implicated in growth retardation in such nutritional stress. Our results reveal a previously unknown link between Pro metabolism and phosphate nutrition and show that Pro biosynthesis is target of cross talk between ABA signaling and regulation of phosphate homeostasis through PHR1- and PHL1-mediated transcriptional activation of the <i>P5CS1</i> gene.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in plants could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most plants, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) plants overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects plant N use efficiency. The modified plants were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered plants allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type plants. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing plants displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control plants. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop plants with improved productivity as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

Unique Motifs and Length of Hairpin in Oleosin Target the Cytosolic Side of Endoplasmic Reticulum and Budding Lipid Droplet
<p>Plant cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) are covered with a layer of phospholipids and oleosin and were extensively studied before those in mammals and yeast. Oleosin has short amphipathic N- and C-terminal peptides flanking a conserved 72-residue hydrophobic hairpin, which penetrates and stabilizes the LD. Oleosin is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and extracts ER-budding LDs to cytosol. To delineate the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LD, we have expressed modified-oleosin genes in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> for transient expression and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY2 cells for stable transformation. The results have identified oleosin motifs for targeting ER-LD and oleosin as the sole molecule responsible for budding-LD entering cytosol. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal peptides are not required for the targeting. The hairpin, including its entire length, initial N-portion residues, and hairpin-loop of three Pro and one Ser residues, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as the absence of an N-terminal ER-targeting peptide, are necessary for oleosin targeting ER and moving onto budding LDs and extracting them to cytosol. In a reverse approach, eliminations of these necessities allow the modified oleosin to enter the ER lumen and extract budding LDs to the ER lumen. Modified oleosin with an added vacuole signal peptide transports the ER-luminal LDs to vacuoles. The overall findings define the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LDs and extracting budding LDs to the cytosol as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as reveal potential applications.</p>

A Rice NAC Transcription Factor Promotes Leaf Senescence via ABA Biosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>It is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> known that abscisic acid (ABA)-induced leaf senescence and premature leaf senescence negatively affect the yield of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, the molecular mechanism underlying this relationship, especially the upstream transcriptional network that modulates ABA level during leaf senescence, remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a rice NAC transcription factor, OsNAC2, that participates in ABA-induced leaf senescence. Overexpression of <i>OsNAC2</i> dramatically accelerated leaf senescence, whereas its knockdown lines showed a delay in leaf senescence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR, dual-luciferase, and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrated that OsNAC2 directly activates expression of chlorophyll degradation genes, <i>OsSGR</i> and <i>OsNYC3</i>. Moreover, ectopic expression of <i>OsNAC2</i> leads to an increase in ABA levels via directly up-regulating expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (<i>OsNCED3</i> and <i>OsZEP1</i>) as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as down-regulating the ABA catabolic gene (<i>OsABA8ox1</i>). Interestingly, <i>OsNAC2</i> is upregulated by a lower level of ABA but downregulated by a higher level of ABA, indicating a feedback repression of <i>OsNAC2</i> by ABA. Additionally, reduced <i>OsNAC2</i> expression leads to about 10% increase in the grain yield of RNAi lines. The novel ABA-NAC-SAGs regulatory module might provide a new insight into the molecular action of ABA to enhance leaf senescence and elucidates the transcriptional network of ABA production during leaf senescence in rice.</p>

Role of Type 2 NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase NdbC in Redox Regulation of Carbon Allocation in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>NAD(P)H dehydrogenases comprise type 1 (NDH-1) and type 2 (NDH-2s) enzymes. Even though the NDH-1 complex is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-characterized protein complex in the thylakoid membrane of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter <i>Synechocystis</i>), the exact roles of different NDH-2s remain poorly understood. To elucidate this question, we studied the function of NdbC, one of the three NDH-2s in <i>Synechocystis</i>, by constructing a deletion mutant (Δ<i>ndbC</i>) for a corresponding protein and submitting the mutant to physiological and biochemical characterization as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as to comprehensive proteomics analysis. We demonstrate that the deletion of NdbC, localized to the plasma membrane, affects several metabolic pathways in <i>Synechocystis</i> in autotrophic growth conditions without prominent effects on photosynthesis. Foremost, the deletion of NdbC leads, directly or indirectly, to compromised sugar catabolism, to glycogen accumulation, and to distorted cell division. Deficiencies in several sugar catabolic routes were supported by severe retardation of growth of the Δ<i>ndbC</i> mutant under light-activated heterotrophic growth conditions but not under mixotrophy. Thus, NdbC has a significant function in regulating carbon allocation between storage and the biosynthesis pathways. In addition, the deletion of NdbC increases the amount of cyclic electron transfer, possibly via the NDH-1<sub>2</sub> complex, and decreases the expression of several transporters in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> growth conditions.</p>

Phylogeny-Based Systematization of Arabidopsis Proteins with Histone H1 Globular Domain
<p>H1 (or linker) histones are basic nuclear proteins that possess an evolutionarily conserved nucleosome-binding globular domain, GH1. They perform critical functions in determining the accessibility of chromatin DNA to trans-acting factors. In most metazoan species studied so far, linker histones are highly heterogenous, with numerous nonallelic variants cooccurring in the same cells. The phylogenetic relationships among these variants as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as their structural and functional properties have been relatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> established. This contrasts markedly with the rather limited knowledge concerning the phylogeny and structural and functional roles of an unusually diverse group of GH1-containing proteins in plants. The dearth of information and the lack of a coherent phylogeny-based nomenclature of these proteins can lead to misunderstandings regarding their identity and possible relationships, thereby hampering plant chromatin research. Based on published data and our in silico and high-throughput analyses, we propose a systematization and coherent nomenclature of GH1-containing proteins of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> [L.] Heynh) that will be useful for both the identification and structural and functional characterization of homologous proteins from other plant species.</p>

Cellulose-Derived Oligomers Act as Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns and Trigger Defense-Like Responses
<p>The plant cell wall, often the site of initial encounters between plants and their microbial pathogens, is composed of a complex mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin polysaccharides as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as proteins. The concept of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) was proposed to describe plant elicitors like oligogalacturonides (OGs), which can be derived by the breakdown of the pectin homogalacturon by pectinases. OGs act via many of the same signaling steps as pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to elicit defenses and provide protection against pathogens. Given both the complexity of the plant cell wall and the fact that many pathogens secrete a wide range of cell wall-degrading enzymes, we reasoned that the breakdown products of other cell wall polymers may be similarly biologically active as elicitors and may help to reinforce the perception of danger by plant cells. Our results indicate that oligomers derived from cellulose are perceived as signal molecules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), triggering a signaling cascade that shares some similarities to responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-known elicitors such as chitooligomers and OGs. However, in contrast to other known PAMPs/DAMPs, cellobiose stimulates neither detectable reactive oxygen species production nor callose deposition. Confirming our idea that both PAMPs and DAMPs are likely to cooccur at infection sites, cotreatments of cellobiose with flg22 or chitooligomers led to synergistic increases in gene expression. Thus, the perception of cellulose-derived oligomers may participate in cell wall integrity surveillance and represents an additional layer of signaling following plant cell wall breakdown during cell wall remodeling or pathogen attack.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA proteins that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA proteins are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA proteins are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA proteins map sufficiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA proteins are much larger than the bacterial BcsA protein, prompting the suggestion that these plant-specific regions are important for interactions between CESA proteins and for conferring CESA class specificity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA proteins, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA proteins and hence what determines the specificity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class specificity extends throughout the protein and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site specificity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

Activation of Mitochondrial Protein Phosphatase SLP2 by MIA40 Regulates Seed Germination
<p>Reversible protein phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases and phosphatases represents the most prolific and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-characterized posttranslational modification known. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>Shewanella</i>-like protein phosphatase 2 (AtSLP2) is a bona fide Ser/Thr protein phosphatase that is targeted to the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) where it interacts with the mitochondrial oxidoreductase import and assembly protein 40 (AtMIA40), forming a protein complex. Interaction with AtMIA40 is necessary for the phosphatase activity of AtSLP2 and is dependent on the formation of disulfide bridges on AtSLP2. Furthermore, by utilizing <i>atslp2</i> null mutant, AtSLP2 complemented and AtSLP2 overexpressing plants, we identify a function for the AtSLP2-AtMIA40 complex in negatively regulating gibberellic acid-related processes during seed germination. Results presented here characterize a mitochondrial IMS-localized protein phosphatase identified in photosynthetic eukaryotes as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as a protein phosphatase target of the highly conserved eukaryotic MIA40 IMS oxidoreductase.</p>

A Cysteine-Rich Protein Kinase Associates with a Membrane Immune Complex and the Cysteine Residues Are Required for Cell Death
<p>Membrane-localized proteins perceive and respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. We performed quantitative proteomics on plasma membrane-enriched samples from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) treated with bacterial flagellin. We identified multiple receptor-like protein kinases changing in abundance, including cysteine (Cys)-rich receptor-like kinases (CRKs) that are up-regulated upon the perception of flagellin. CRKs possess extracellular Cys-rich domains and constitute a gene family consisting of 46 members in Arabidopsis. The single transfer DNA insertion lines <i>CRK28</i> and <i>CRK29</i>, two CRKs induced in response to flagellin perception, did not exhibit robust alterations in immune responses. In contrast, silencing of multiple bacterial flagellin-induced CRKs resulted in enhanced susceptibility to pathogenic <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, indicating functional redundancy in this large gene family. Enhanced expression of <i>CRK28</i> in Arabidopsis increased disease resistance to <i>P. syringae</i>. Expression of <i>CRK28</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced cell death, which required intact extracellular Cys residues and a conserved kinase active site. CRK28-mediated cell death required the common receptor-like protein kinase coreceptor BAK1. CRK28 associated with BAK1 as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as the activated FLAGELLIN-SENSING2 (FLS2) immune receptor complex.

Transcriptional Gene Silencing Maintained by OTS1 SUMO Protease Requires a DNA-Dependent Polymerase V-Dependent Pathway
<p>The expression of genes with aberrant structure is prevented at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation levels. Aberrant gene silencing at the posttranscriptional level is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> studied; however, it is not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> understood how aberrant genes are silenced at the transcriptional level. In this study, through genetic screening a transgenic report line that harbors an aberrant gene (<i>35S-LUC</i>, lacking 3′-untranslated region [3′-UTR]) and lacks luciferase (LUC) activity, we identify that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease <i>OTS1</i> gene is required for maintaining the silence of the reporter <i>35S-LUC</i> and an endogenous mutator-like element <i>MULE-F19G14</i> at the transcriptional level, which requires DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) V and DDR complex, but not Pol IV. The increased transcripts in <i>ots1</i> mutants are terminated by the 3′-UTRs of downstream genes. In addition to <i>ots1</i> mutations, mutations in several known or putative SUMO proteases and two SUMO E3 ligases, <i>SIZ1</i> and <i>MMS21</i>, have similar effects on this silencing regulation. Taken together, our results reveal that the enzymes involved in the SUMOylation process restrain aberrant gene transcription by using a downstream gene 3′-UTR, and this regulation requires a functional Pol V-dependent pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

An Ethylene-Induced Regulatory Module Delays Flower Senescence by Regulating Cytokinin Content
<p>In many plant species, including rose (<i>Rosa hybrida</i>), flower senescence is promoted by the gaseous hormone ethylene and inhibited by the cytokinin (CTK) class of hormones. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these antagonistic effects are not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> understood. In this study, we characterized the association between a pathogenesis-related PR-10 family gene from rose (<i>RhPR10.1</i>) and the hormonal regulation of flower senescence. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that <i>RhPR10.1</i> was expressed at high levels during senescence in different floral organs, including petal, sepal, receptacle, stamen, and pistil, and that expression was induced by ethylene treatment. Silencing of <i>RhPR10.1</i> expression in rose plants by virus-induced gene silencing accelerated flower senescence, which was accompanied by a higher ion leakage rate in the petals, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as increased expression of the senescence marker gene <i>RhSAG12</i>. CTK content and the expression of three CTK signaling pathway genes were reduced in <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants, and the accelerated rate of petal senescence that was apparent in the <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants was restored to normal levels by CTK treatment. Finally, RhHB6, a homeodomain-Leu zipper I transcription factor, was observed to bind to the <i>RhPR10.1</i> promoter, and silencing of its expression also promoted flower senescence. Our results reveal an ethylene-induced RhHB6-RhPR10.1 regulatory module that functions as a brake of ethylene-promoted senescence through increasing the CTK content.</p>

Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal decomposition of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW decay in which lignin and carbohydrates are both degraded. Mechanistic studies of decay coupled with comparative genomic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their evolutionary origins, but the complete suite of genes necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylogenomic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in gene family diversification rates that are correlated with evolution of WR, using data from 62 fungal genomes. We detected 409 gene families that appear to be evolutionarily correlated with WR. The identified gene families encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-characterized decay enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as 73 gene families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 identified gene families are present in the genome of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results illuminate the complexity of WR and suggest that its evolution has involved a general elaboration of the decay apparatus, including numerous gene families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated genes (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many phenotypes, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as genomic neighborhoods containing several gene duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to gene number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of genomic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical distribution of individual members of families of duplicated genes across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-known gene clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin gene clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian genomes. Differences between previously annotated gene clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific gene clusters, the inclusion or absence of genes between the CTDGs and their corresponding gene clusters, and the splitting of certain gene clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human genes showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-known gene clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.</p>

Selective Sweeps across Twenty Millions Years of Primate Evolution
<p>The contribution from selective sweeps to variation in genetic diversity has proven notoriously difficult to assess, in part because polymorphism data only allows detection of sweeps in the most recent few hundred thousand years. Here, we show how linked selection in ancestral species can be quantified across evolutionary timescales by analyzing patterns of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) along the genomes of closely related species. We show that sweeps in the human–chimpanzee and human–orangutan ancestors can be identified as depletions of ILS in regions in excess of 100 kb in length. Sweeps predicted in each ancestral species, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as recurrent sweeps predicted in both species, often overlap sweeps predicted in humans. This suggests that many genomic regions experience recurrent selective sweeps. By comparing the ILS patterns along the genomes of the closely related human–chimpanzee and human–orangutan ancestors, we are further able to quantify the impact of selective sweeps relative to that of background selection. Compared with the human–orangutan ancestor, the human–chimpanzee ancestor shows a strong excess of regions depleted of ILS as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as a stronger reduction in ILS around genes. We conclude that sweeps play a strong role in reducing diversity along the genome and that sweeps have reduced diversity in the human–chimpanzee ancestor much more than in the human–orangutan ancestor.</p>

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Frequencies of Known Haplotypes from Pooled Sequence Data
<p>DNA samples are often pooled, either by experimental design or because the sample itself is a mixture.

Alternatively, the sample itself may be a mixture of multiple species or strains (e.g., bacterial species comprising a microbiome or pathogen strains in a blood sample). We present an expectation–maximization algorithm for estimating haplotype frequencies in a pooled sample directly from mapped sequence reads, in the case where the possible haplotypes are known.

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

<p>In contrast to other terrestrial arthropods, where gaseous O<sub>2</sub> that fuels aerobic metabolism diffuses to the tissues in tracheal tubes, and most other metazoans, where O<sub>2</sub> is transported to tissues by circulating respiratory proteins, the myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) strikingly have tracheal systems as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as circulating hemocyanin (Hc). In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin and biological significance of millipede Hc, we report the molecular structure (subunit composition and amino acid sequence) of multimeric (36-mer) Hc from the forest floor-d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>ing giant African millipede <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> and its allosteric oxygen-binding properties under various physico-chemical conditions. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc consists of only a single subunit type with differential glycosylation. Phylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc binds O<sub>2</sub> with a high affinity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O<sub>2</sub> binding is, moreover, modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which increase the O<sub>2</sub> affinity of the Hc in the tense (T; deoxygenated) as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as the relaxed (R; oxygenated) states, and by (<sc>l</sc>)-lactate, which modulates Hc–O<sub>2</sub> affinity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, <i>L</i>. Cooperativity in O<sub>2</sub> binding at half O<sub>2</sub> saturation (<i>n</i><sub>50</sub>) is pH dependent and maximal at ~pH 7.4, and the number of interacting O<sub>2</sub>-binding sites (<i>q</i>) is markedly increased by binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The data are discussed in the light of the mutually supplementary roles of Hc and the tracheal system for tissue O<sub>2</sub> supply.</p>

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 components were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was a score of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring system and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular component.   This scoring system provides a clinically useful tool for pre-operative   planning, and the evaluation of the outcome of revision surgery   for patients with loosening of a cementless acetabular component   in the presence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:601–6.</p></sec>

Cement-in-cement revision of the femoral stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Compared with primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), revision   surgery can be challenging. The cement-in-cement femoral revision   technique involves removing a femoral component from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-fixed   femoral cement mantle and cementing a new stem into the original   mantle. This technique is widely used and when carried out for the   correct indications, is fast, relatively inexpensive and carries   a reduced short-term risk for the patient compared with the alternative   of removing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-fixed cement. We report the outcomes of this procedure   when two commonly used femoral stems are used.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 1179 cement-in-cement stem revisions involving   an Exeter or a Lubinus stem reported to the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty   Register (SHAR) between January 1999 and December 2015. Kaplan-Meier   survival analysis was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Survivorship is reported up to six years and was better in the   Exeter group (91% standard deviation (<sc>sd)</sc> 2.8% <i>versus</i> 85% <sc>sd</sc> 5.0%)   (p = 0.02). There was, however, no significant difference in the   survival of the stem and risk of re-revision for any reason (p =   0.58) and for aseptic loosening (p = 0.97), between revisions in   which the Exeter stem (94% <sc>sd</sc> 2.2%; 98% <sc>sd</sc> 1.6%)   was used compared with those in which the Lubinus stem (95% <sc>sd</sc> 3.2%;   98% <sc>sd</sc> 2.2%) was used. The database did not allow identification   of whether a further revision was indicated for loosening of the acetabular   or femoral component or both.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The cement-in-cement technique for revision of the femoral component   gave promising results using both designs of stem, six years post-operatively.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):27–32.</p></sec>

Degenerative subtalar joints complicated by medial plantar intraneural cysts
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The pathogenesis of intraneural ganglion cysts is controversial.   Recent reports in the literature described medial plantar intraneural   ganglion cysts (mIGC) with articular branches to subtalar joints.   The aim of the current study was to provide further support for   the principles underlying the articular theory, and to explain the   successes and failures of treatment of mICGs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2006 and 2017, five patients with five mICGs were retrospectively   reviewed. There were five men with a mean age of 50.2 years (33   to 68) and a mean follow-up of 3.8 years (0.8 to 6). Case history,   physical examination, imaging, and intraoperative findings were   reviewed. The outcomes of interest were ultrasound and/or MRI features   of mICG, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as the clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The five intraneural cysts followed the principles of the unifying   articular theory. Connection to the posterior subtalar joint (pSTJ)   was identified or suspected in four patients. Re-evaluation of preoperative   MRI demonstrated a degenerative pSTJ and denervation changes in   the abductor hallucis in all patients. Cyst excision with resection   of the articular branch (four), cyst incision and drainage (one),   and percutaneous aspiration/steroid injection (two) were performed.   Removing the connection to the pSTJ prevented recurrence of mIGC,   whereas medial plantar nerves remained cystic and symptomatic when   resection of the communicating articular branch was not performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings support a standardized treatment algorithm for mIGC   in the presence of degenerative disease at the pSTJ. By understanding   the pathoanatomic mechanism for every cyst, we can improve treatment   that must address the articular branch to avoid the recurrence of   intraneural ganglion cysts, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as the degenerative pSTJ to   avoid extraneural cyst formation or recurrence.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:183–9.</p></sec>

Stroma provides an intestinal stem cell niche in the absence of epithelial Wnts
<p>Wnt/β-catenin signaling supports intestinal homeostasis by regulating proliferation in the crypt. Multiple Wnts are expressed in Paneth cells as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as other intestinal epithelial and stromal cells. <i>Ex vivo</i>, Wnts secreted by Paneth cells can support intestinal stem cells when Wnt signaling is enhanced with supplemental R-Spondin 1 (RSPO1). However, <i>in vivo</i>, the source of Wnts in the stem cell niche is less clear. Genetic ablation of <i>Porcn</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum resident O-acyltransferase that is essential for the secretion and activity of all vertebrate Wnts, confirmed the role of intestinal epithelial Wnts in <i>ex vivo</i> culture. Unexpectedly, mice lacking epithelial Wnt activity (<i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup>/Villin-Cre</i> mice) had normal intestinal proliferation and differentiation, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as successful regeneration after radiation injury, indicating that epithelial Wnts are dispensable for these processes. Consistent with a key role for stroma in the crypt niche, intestinal stromal cells endogenously expressing Wnts and <i>Rspo3</i> support the growth of <i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup></i> organoids <i>ex vivo</i> without RSPO1 supplementation. Conversely, increasing pharmacologic PORCN inhibition, affecting both stroma and epithelium, reduced <i>Lgr5</i> intestinal stem cells, inhibited recovery from radiation injury, and at the highest dose fully blocked intestinal proliferation. We conclude that epithelial Wnts are dispensable and that stromal production of Wnts can fully support normal murine intestinal homeostasis.</p>

<i>ATML1</i> promotes epidermal cell differentiation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> shoots
<p>Molecular mechanisms that generate distinct tissue layers in plant shoots are not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> understood. <i>ATML1</i>, an <i>Arabidopsis</i> homeobox gene, is expressed in the outermost cell layer, beginning at an early stage of development. The promoters of many epidermis-specific genes, including <i>ATML1</i>, contain an ATML1-binding site called an L1 box, suggesting that ATML1 regulates epidermal cell fate. Here, we show that overexpression of <i>ATML1</i> was sufficient to activate the expression of epidermal genes and to induce epidermis-related traits such as the formation of stomatal guard cells and trichome-like cells in non-epidermal seedling tissues. Detailed observation of the division planes of these ectopic stomatal cells suggested that a near-surface position, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as epidermal cell identity, were required for regular anticlinal cell division, as seen in wild-type epidermis. Moreover, analyses of a loss-of-function mutant and overexpressors implied that differentiation of epidermal cells was associated with repression of mesophyll cell fate. Collectively, our studies contribute new information about the molecular basis of cell fate determination in different layers of plant aerial organs.</p>

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital volume is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission volume, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case volume, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome measures were (1) process measures at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study these associations with hospital volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-volume hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process measures than higher-volume hospitals. Higher hospital volume was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher volumes with lower 6-month mortality (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective national quality improvement registry of older patients with HF indicates that hospital volume as a structural metric correlates with process measures, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up. Hospital profiling should focus on participation in systems of care, adherence to process metrics, and risk-standardized outcomes rather than on hospital volume itself.</p></sec>

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely based on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of diagnosis of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (hazard ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard ratio death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-intensity statins with lower amputation and death risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-intensity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-based study to show that high-intensity statin use at the time of PAD diagnosis is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and mortality in comparison with low-to-moderate–intensity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>.</p></sec>

A Population-Based Study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Treatment in Finland 2000 to 2014
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the event of rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), mortality is very high. AAA prevalence and incidence of ruptures have been reported to be decreasing. The treatment of AAA has also undergone a change in recent decades with a shift toward endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Our aim was to evaluate how these changes have affected the elective and emergency treatment of AAA and their results in Finland.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for AAA in Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million, during 2000 to 2014 were searched from the registry of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. Data on all patients who had died of AAA during the same time period were obtained from Statistics Finland. The data were combined and analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The annual incidence of ruptured AAA was 16.4 per 100 000 population over 50 years and decreased significantly during the study period. Over half of the 4949 patients who had a ruptured AAA died outside the hospital. Thirty-day mortality after emergency repair was 39.4%. Intact AAA repairs numbered 4956. The absolute number of annual repairs increased during the study period, and the use of EVAR became the dominant method of elective repair. Thirty-day mortality in elective AAA repair dropped significantly from 6.3% in 2000 to 2004 to 2.7% in 2010 to 2014 mostly because of the increased number of EVAR procedures with lower mortality. Long-term mortality in patients treated with EVAR was higher than in patients treated with open repair. Mortality after elective AAA repair was primarily attributable to cardiovascular causes, but there was a slightly higher proportion of AAA-related late deaths in patients treated with EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ruptured AAA incidence for men >65 years has declined by nearly 30% in Finland, likely because of the decrease in AAA prevalence. The treatment results have improved as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> for both elective and emergency repair. Increased use of EVAR has resulted in a decrease of mortality after elective AAA repair, but results of open repair have improved as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>. However, late mortality from elective EVAR is surprisingly high in comparison with open repair, which may have been exaggerated by patient selection.</p></sec>

Plasma Metabolomics Implicates Modified Transfer RNAs and Altered Bioenergetics in the Outcomes of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a heterogeneous disorder with high mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a comprehensive study of plasma metabolites using ultraperformance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to identify patients at high risk of early death, to identify patients who respond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> to treatment, and to provide novel molecular insights into disease pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three circulating metabolites distinguished <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-phenotyped patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH (n=365) from healthy control subjects (n=121) after correction for multiple testing (<i>P</i><7.3e-5) and confounding factors, including drug therapy, and renal and hepatic impairment. A subset of 20 of 53 metabolites also discriminated patients with PAH from disease control subjects (symptomatic patients without pulmonary hypertension, n=139). Sixty-two metabolites were prognostic in PAH, with 36 of 62 independent of established prognostic markers. Increased levels of tRNA-specific modified nucleosides (N2,N2-dimethylguanosine, N1-methylinosine), tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (malate, fumarate), glutamate, fatty acid acylcarnitines, tryptophan, and polyamine metabolites and decreased levels of steroids, sphingomyelins, and phosphatidylcholines distinguished patients from control subjects. The largest differences correlated with increased risk of death, and correction of several metabolites over time was associated with a better outcome. Patients who responded to calcium channel blocker therapy had metabolic profiles similar to those of healthy control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Metabolic profiles in PAH are strongly related to survival and should be considered part of the deep phenotypic characterization of this disease. Our results support the investigation of targeted therapeutic strategies that seek to address the alterations in translational regulation and energy metabolism that characterize these patients.</p></sec>

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults

We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these measures using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each measure of diastolic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for diastolic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-based cut points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal diastolic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal diastolic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal measures and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 diastolic measures were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign. The use of age-based normative values when considering an elderly population improves the risk discrimination of diastolic measures for incident HF or death.</p></sec>

It remains unclear which strategy is most attractive for clinical application.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively enrolled unselected patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. The final diagnosis was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists. Hs-cTnI levels were measured at presentation and after 1 hour in a blinded fashion. We directly compared all 4 hs-cTnI–based rule-out strategies: limit of detection (LOD, hs-cTnI<2 ng/L), single cutoff (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L), 1-hour algorithm (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L and 1-hour change<2 ng/L), and the 0/1-hour algorithm recommended in the European Society of Cardiology guideline combining LOD and 1-hour algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 2828 enrolled patients, acute myocardial infarction was the final diagnosis in 451 (16%) patients. The LOD approach ruled out 453 patients (16%) with a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 99.2%–100%), the single cutoff 1516 patients (54%) with a sensitivity of 97.1% (95% CI, 95.1%–98.3%), the 1-hour algorithm 1459 patients (52%) with a sensitivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%), and the 0/1-hour algorithm 1463 patients (52%) with a sensitivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%). Predefined subgroup analysis in early presenters (≤2 hours) revealed significantly lower sensitivity (94.2%, interaction <i>P</i>=0.03) of the single cutoff, but not the other strategies. Two-year survival was 100% with LOD and 98.1% with the other strategies (<i>P</i><0.01 for LOD versus each of the other strategies).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>All 4 rule-out strategies balance effectiveness and safety equally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>. The single cutoff should not be applied in early presenters, whereas the 3 other strategies seem to perform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> in this challenging subgroup.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Tailored semiconductors for high-harmonic optoelectronics
<p>The advent of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic generation in gases 30 years ago set the foundation for attosecond science and facilitated ultrafast spectroscopy in atoms, molecules, and solids. We explore high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic generation in the solid state by means of nanostructured and ion-implanted semiconductors. We use wavelength-selective microscopic imaging to map enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic emission and show that the generation medium and the driving field can be locally tailored in solids by modifying the chemical composition and morphology. This enables the control of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic technology within precisely engineered solid targets. We demonstrate customized high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic wave fields with wavelengths down to 225 nanometers (ninth-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic order of 2-micrometer laser pulses) and present an integrated Fresnel zone plate target in silicon, which leads to diffraction-limited self-focusing of the generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ics down to 1-micrometer spot sizes.</p>

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation
<p>The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear optical responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear optical processes is high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron motion induced by an intense light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ics in graphene excited by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser excitation, and the resultant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions.</p>

Optical imaging of surface chemistry and dynamics in confinement
<p>We imaged the interfacial structure and dynamics of water in a microscopically confined geometry, in three dimensions and on millisecond time scales, with a structurally illuminated wide-field second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic microscope. The second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic images reported on the orientational order of interfacial water, induced by charge-dipole interactions between water molecules and surface charges. The images were converted into surface potential maps. Spatially resolved surface acid dissociation constant (p<i>K</i><sub>a,s</sub>) values were determined for the silica deprotonation reaction by following pH-induced chemical changes on the curved and confined surfaces of a glass microcapillary immersed in aqueous solutions. These values ranged from 2.3 to 10.7 along the wall of a single capillary because of surface heterogeneities. Water molecules that rotate along an oscillating external electric field were also imaged.</p>

Correlations in high-harmonic generation of matter-wave jets revealed by pattern recognition
<p>Correlations in interacting many-body systems are key to the study of quantum matter. The complexity of the correlations typically grows quickly as the system evolves and thus presents a challenge for experimental characterization and intuitive understanding. In a strongly driven Bose-Einstein condensate, we observe the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic generation of matter-wave jets with complex correlations as a result of bosonic stimulation. Based on a pattern recognition scheme, we identify a pattern of correlations that reveals the underlying secondary scattering processes and higher-order correlations. We show that pattern recognition offers a versatile strategy to visualize and analyze the quantum dynamics of a many-body system.</p>

Smoothening out the patches
<p>Signaling pathways regulated by the lipidated protein ligand Hedgehog (HH) direct the development of all metazoans through unique molecular mechanisms that remain elusive. More than two decades after their discovery, a series of recently determined structures of two key HH signaling transducers—the transmembrane proteins Patched (PTCH) and Smoothened (SMO)—are now beginning to reveal the signaling events triggered by HH and homologous ligands at the cell membrane. On page 52 of this issue, Qi <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) describe structures derived by cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ize recent reports (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>) of the structure of the HH receptor PTCH, an important tumor suppressor (<i>4</i>). Together with recent crystal structures of the seven-transmembrane-spanning protein SMO (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>), they provide important new insight on molecular events in HH signaling and suggest new opportunities for targeting this pathway in cancer and other diseases (<i>4</i>).</p>

Probing optically silent superfluid stripes in cuprates
<p>Unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates coexists with other types of electronic order. However, some of these orders are invisible to most experimental probes because of their symmetry. For example, the possible existence of superfluid stripes is not easily validated with linear optics, because the stripe alignment causes interlayer superconducting tunneling to vanish on average. Here we show that this frustration is removed in the nonlinear optical response. A giant terahertz third <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic, characteristic of nonlinear Josephson tunneling, is observed in La<sub>1.885</sub>Ba<sub>0.115</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> above the transition temperature <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 13 kelvin and up to the charge-ordering temperature <i>T</i><sub>co</sub> = 55 kelvin. We model these results by hypothesizing the presence of a pair density wave condensate, in which nonlinear mixing of optically silent tunneling modes drives large dipole-carrying supercurrents.</p>

Chaos-assisted broadband momentum transformation in optical microresonators
<p>The law of momentum conservation rules out many desired processes in optical microresonators. We report broadband momentum transformations of light in asymmetric whispering gallery microresonators. Assisted by chaotic motions, broadband light can travel between optical modes with different angular momenta within a few picoseconds. Efficient coupling from visible to near-infrared bands is demonstrated between a nanowaveguide and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">whispering gallery mod</span></strong>es with quality factors exceeding 10 million. The broadband momentum transformation enhances the device conversion efficiency of the third-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic generation by greater than three orders of magnitude over the conventional evanescent-wave coupling. The observed broadband and fast momentum transformation could promote applications such as multicolor lasers, broadband memories, and multiwavelength optical networks.</p>

Jupiter’s interior and deep atmosphere: The initial pole-to-pole passes with the Juno spacecraft
<p>On 27 August 2016, the Juno spacecraft acquired science observations of Jupiter, passing less than 5000 kilometers above the equatorial cloud tops. Images of Jupiter’s poles show a chaotic scene, unlike Saturn’s poles. Microwave sounding reveals weather features at pressures deeper than 100 bars, dominated by an ammonia-rich, narrow low-latitude plume resembling a deeper, wider version of Earth’s Hadley cell. Near-infrared mapping reveals the relative humidity within prominent downwelling regions. Juno’s measured gravity field differs substantially from the last available estimate and is one order of magnitude more precise. This has implications for the distribution of heavy elements in the interior, including the existence and mass of Jupiter’s core. The observed magnetic field exhibits smaller spatial variations than expected, indicative of a rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic content.</p>

A parity-breaking electronic nematic phase transition in the spin-orbit coupled metal Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
<p>Strong electron interactions can drive metallic systems toward a variety of well-known symmetry-broken phases, but the instabilities of correlated metals with strong spin-orbit coupling have only recently begun to be explored. We uncovered a multipolar nematic phase of matter in the metallic pyrochlore Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> using spatially resolved second-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic optical anisotropy measurements. Like previously discovered electronic nematic phases, this multipolar phase spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry while preserving translational invariance. However, it has the distinguishing property of being odd under spatial inversion, which is allowed only in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. By examining the critical behavior of the multipolar nematic order parameter, we show that it drives the thermal phase transition near 200 kelvin in Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and induces a parity-breaking lattice distortion as a secondary order.</p>

Time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy with a water window high-harmonic source
<p>Time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy (TR-XAS) has so far practically been limited to large-scale facilities, to subpicosecond temporal resolution, and to the condensed phase. We report the realization of TR-XAS with a temporal resolution in the low femtosecond range by developing a tabletop high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic source reaching up to 350 electron volts, thus partially covering the spectral region of 280 to 530 electron volts, where water is transmissive. We used this source to follow previously unexamined light-induced chemical reactions in the lowest electronic states of isolated CF<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and SF<sub>6</sub><sup>+</sup> molecules in the gas phase. By probing element-specific core-to-valence transitions at the carbon K-edge or the sulfur L-edges, we characterized their reaction paths and observed the effect of symmetry breaking through the splitting of absorption bands and Rydberg-valence mixing induced by the geometry changes.</p>

Association of Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Venous Thromboembolism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Much controversy surrounds the association of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors with venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an individual level random-effect meta-analysis including 9 prospective studies with measured baseline cardiovascular disease risk factors and validated VTE events. Definitions were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ized across studies. Traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors were modeled categorically and continuously using restricted cubic splines. Estimates were obtained for overall VTE, provoked VTE (ie, VTE occurring in the presence of 1 or more established VTE risk factors), and unprovoked VTE, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The studies included 244 865 participants with 4910 VTE events occurring during a mean follow-up of 4.7 to 19.7 years per study. Age, sex, and body mass index-adjusted hazard ratios for overall VTE were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89−1.07) for hypertension, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88−1.08) for hyperlipidemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89−1.15) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08−1.32) for current smoking. After full adjustment, these estimates were numerically similar. When modeled continuously, an inverse association was observed for systolic blood pressure (hazard ratio=0.79 [95% CI: 0.68−0.92] at systolic blood pressure 160 vs 110 mm Hg) but not for diastolic blood pressure or lipid measures with VTE. An important finding from VTE subtype analyses was that cigarette smoking was associated with provoked but not unprovoked VTE. Fully adjusted hazard ratios for the associations of current smoking with provoked and unprovoked VTE were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.22−1.52) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.90−1.29), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Except for the association between cigarette smoking and provoked VTE, which is potentially mediated through comorbid conditions such as cancer, the modifiable traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors are not associated with increased VTE risk. Higher systolic blood pressure showed an inverse association with VTE.</p></sec>

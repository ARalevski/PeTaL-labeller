Vernier spectrometer using counterpropagating soliton microcombs
<p>Determination of laser frequency with high resolution under continuous and abrupt tuning conditions is important for sensing, spectroscopy, and communications. We show that a single microresonator provides rapid and broadband measurement of optical frequencies with a relative frequency precision comparable to that of conventional dual-frequency comb systems. Dual-locked counterpropagating solitons having slightly different repetition rates were used to implement a vernier spectrometer, which enabled characterization of laser tuning rates as high as 10 terahertz per second, broadly step-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong>d lasers, multiline laser spectra, and molecular absorption lines. Besides providing a considerable technical simplification through the dual-locked solitons and enhanced capability for measurement of arbitrarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong>d sources, our results reveal possibilities for chip-scale spectrometers that exceed the performance of tabletop grating and interferometer-based devices.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)
<sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ing Water Apart</title><p>The main route for producing hydrogen for industrial chemical synthesis is steam reforming, in which water and methane react at high temperatures on nickel catalysts to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

High-resolution cryo-EM analysis of the yeast ATP synthase in a lipid membrane
<p>Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase comprises a membrane embedded F<sub>o</sub> motor that rotates to drive ATP synthesis in the F<sub>1</sub> subunit. We used single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain structures of the full complex in a lipid bilayer in the absence or presence of the inhibitor oligomycin at 3.6- and 3.8-angstrom resolution, respectively. To limit conformational heterogeneity, we locked the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotor</span></strong> in a single conformation by fusing the F6 subunit of the stator with the δ subunit of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotor</span></strong>. Assembly of the enzyme with the F6-δ fusion caused a twisting of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotor</span></strong> and a 9° rotation of the F<sub>o</sub> c<sub>10</sub>-ring in the direction of ATP synthesis, relative to the structure of isolated F<sub>o</sub>. Our cryo-EM structures show how F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>o</sub> are coupled, give insight into the proton translocation pathway, and show how oligomycin blocks ATP synthesis.</p>

Spectroscopic snapshots of the proton-transfer mechanism in water
<p>The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high proton mobility in water as a sequence of proton transfers along a hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) network. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ional spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk water. Here we report how the much simpler <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ional spectra of cold, composition-selected heavy water clusters, D<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>, can be exploited to capture clear markers that encode the collective reaction coordinate along the proton-transfer event.

The lysine deacetylase Sirtuin 1 modulates the localization and function of the Notch1 receptor in regulatory T cells
<p>The ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong> cellular functions in response to nutrient availability has important consequences for immune homeostasis. The activity of the receptor Notch in regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, which suppress the functions of effector T cells, is indispensable for T<sub>reg</sub> cell survival under conditions of diminished nutrient supply. Anti-apoptotic signaling induced by the Notch1 intracellular domain (NIC) originates from the cytoplasm and is spatially decoupled from the nuclear, largely transcriptional functions of NIC. We showed that Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), which is an NAD<sup>+</sup> (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)–dependent lysine deacetylase that inhibits NIC-dependent gene transcription, stabilized NIC proximal to the plasma membrane to promote the survival and function of activated T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Sirt1 was required for NIC-dependent protection from apoptosis in cell lines but not for the activity of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. In addition, a variant NIC protein in which four lysines were mutated to arginines (NIC4KR) retained anti-apoptotic activity, but was not regulated by Sirt1, and reconstituted the functions of nonnuclear NIC in Notch1-deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Loss of Sirt1 compromised T<sub>reg</sub> cell survival, resulting in antigen-induced T cell proliferation and inflammation in two mouse models. Thus, the Sirt1-Notch interaction may constitute an important checkpoint that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong>s noncanonical Notch1 signaling.</p>

Metastable ferroelectricity in optically strained SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
<p>Fluctuating orders in solids are generally considered high-temperature precursors of broken symmetry phases. However, in some cases, these fluctuations persist to zero temperature and prevent the emergence of long-range order. Strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>) is a quantum paraelectric in which dipolar fluctuations grow upon cooling, although a long-range ferroelectric order never sets in. Here, we show that optical excitation of lattice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ions can induce polar order. This metastable polar phase, observed up to temperatures exceeding 290 kelvin, persists for hours after the optical pump is interrupted. Furthermore, hardening of a low-frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ion points to a photoinduced ferroelectric phase transition, with a spatial domain distribution suggestive of a photoflexoelectric coupling.</p>

Complex signal processing in synthetic gene circuits using cooperative regulatory assemblies
<p>Eukaryotic genes are regulated by multivalent transcription factor complexes. Through cooperative self-assembly, these complexes perform nonlinear regulatory operations involved in cellular decision-making and signal processing. In this study, we apply this design principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative assemblies can program nonlinear gene circuit behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying the strength and number of assembly subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and nonlinear regulatory responses for single- and multi-input circuits. We demonstrate that assemblies can be adjusted to control circuit dynamics. We harness this capability to engineer circuits that perform dynamic filtering, enabling frequency-dependent decoding in cell populations. Programmable cooperative assembly provides a versatile way to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong> the nonlinearity of network connections, markedly expanding the engineerable behaviors available to synthetic circuits.</p>

Neural representations across species
<p>A plethora of studies in rodents have described spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong>d neurons, including place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), suggesting a crucial role of the hippocampal formation in spatial navigation (<i>1</i>). Human studies have, in turn, shown that the hippocampal formation is involved in declarative memory (memories of facts and events) (<i>2</i>). What, then, is the function of the hippocampus? Is it involved in memory or in spatial navigation, or does it have a more general function that encompasses both? Several studies have shown that place cells remap, changing the location at which they respond, following geometrical changes in the environment, and that they can be modulated by nonspatial factors, according to the animals' specific tasks (<i>3</i>). These findings highlight the coding of cognitive components, challenging the notion that place cells represent an invariant spatial map. Although grid cells also realign with physical changes in the environment (<i>4</i>), the geometrical structure of their fields has been considered to provide a more invariant spatial representation. But do grid cells encode cognitive aspects as well? On pages 1443 and 1447 of this issue, Boccara <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) and Butler <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>), respectively, show that this is the case, providing compelling evidence that grid cells are modulated by reward location. Complementing these studies, Baraduc <i>et al.</i> (<i>7</i>) showed that variations in spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong>d neurons in the monkey hippocampus are accompanied by a “schema” of the task. Together these studies provide insights on how neurons in the hippocampal formation go beyond purely spatial representations and are modulated by cognitive factors.</p>

Tunable intrinsic strain in two-dimensional transition metal electrocatalysts
<p>Tuning surface strain is a powerful strategy for tailoring the reactivity of metal catalysts. Traditionally, surface strain is imposed by external stress from a heterogeneous substrate, but the effect is often obscured by interfacial reconstructions and nanocatalyst geometries. Here, we report on a strategy to resolve these problems by exploiting intrinsic surface stresses in two-dimensional transition metal nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations indicate that attractive interactions between surface atoms lead to tensile surface stresses that exert a pressure on the order of 10<sup>5</sup> atmospheres on the surface atoms and impart up to 10% compressive strain, with the exact magnitude inversely proportional to the nanosheet thickness. Atomic-level control of thickness thus enables generation and fine-tuning of intrinsic strain to optimize catalytic reactivity, which was confirmed experimentally on Pd(110) nanosheets for the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, with activity enhancements that were more than an order of magnitude greater than those of their nanoparticle counterparts.</p>

Vectorial representation of spatial goals in the hippocampus of bats
<p>To navigate, animals need to represent not only their own position and orientation, but also the location of their goal. Neural representations of an animal’s own position and orientation have been extensively studied. However, it is unknown how navigational goals are encoded in the brain. We recorded from hippocampal CA1 neurons of bats flying in complex trajectories toward a spatial goal. We discovered a subpopulation of neurons with angular tuning to the goal direction. Many of these neurons were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong>d to an occluded goal, suggesting that goal-direction representation is memory-based. We also found cells that encoded the distance to the goal, often in conjunction with goal direction. The goal-direction and goal-distance signals make up a vectorial representation of spatial goals, suggesting a previously unrecognized neuronal mechanism for goal-directed navigation.</p>

A PIF1/PIF3-HY5-BBX23 Transcription Factor Cascade Affects Photomorphogenesis
<p>Light signaling plays an essential role in controlling higher plants’ early developmental process termed as photomorphogenesis. Transcriptional regulation is a vital mechanism that is orchestrated by transcription factors and other regulatory proteins working in concert to finely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong> gene expression. Although many transcription factors/regulators have been characterized in the light-signaling pathway, their interregulation remains largely unknown. Here, we show that PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3) and PIF1 transcription factors directly bind to the regulatory regions of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and a B-box gene BBX23 and activate their expression in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that BBX23 and its close homolog gene BBX22 play a redundant role in regulating hypocotyl growth, and that plants overexpressing BBX23 display reduced hypocotyl elongation under red, far-red, and blue light conditions. Intriguingly, BBX23 transcription is inhibited by light, whereas its protein is degraded in darkness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HY5 physically interacts with BBX23, and these two proteins coordinately regulate the expression of both light-induced and light-repressed genes. BBX23 is also recruited to the promoter sequences of the light-responsive genes in a partial HY5-dependent manner. Taken together, our study reveals that the transcriptional cascade consisting of PIF1/PIF3, HY5, and BBX23 controls photomorphogenesis, providing a transcriptional regulatory layer by which plants fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong> their growth in response to changing light environment.</p>

ANAC017 Coordinates Organellar Functions and Stress Responses by Reprogramming Retrograde Signaling
<p>Mitochondria adjust their activities in response to external and internal stimuli to optimize growth via the mitochondrial retrograde response signaling pathway. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NAC domain transcription factor ANAC017 has previously been identified as a regulator of the mitochondrial retrograde response. We show here that overexpression of <i>ANAC017</i> in Arabidopsis leads to growth retardation, altered leaf development with decreased cell size and viability, and early leaf senescence. RNA sequencing analyses revealed that increased <i>ANAC017</i> expression leads to higher expression of genes related to mitochondrial stress, cell death/autophagy, and leaf senescence under nonlimiting growth conditions as well as extensive repression of chloroplast function. Gene regulatory network analysis indicated that a complex hierarchy of transcription factors exists downstream of ANAC017. These involve a set of up-regulated ANAC and WRKY transcription factors associated with organellar signaling and senescence. The network also includes a number of ethylene- and gibberellic acid-related transcription factors with established functions in stress responses and growth regulation, which down-regulate their target genes. A number of BASIC LEUCINE-ZIPPER MOTIF transcription factors involved in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response or balancing of energy homeostasis via the SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE1 were also down-regulated by <i>ANAC017</i> overexpression. Our results show that the endoplasmic reticulum membrane tethering of the constitutively expressed ANAC017, and its controlled release, are crucial to fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong> a fast reactive but potentially harmful signaling cascade. Thus, ANAC017 is a master regulator of cellular responses with mitochondria acting as central sensors.</p>

Modulating Protein Stability to Switch Toxic Protein Function On and Off in Living Cells
<p>Toxic proteins are prime targets for molecular farming (the generation of pharmacologically active or biotechnologically usable compounds in plants) and are also efficient tools for targeted cell ablation in genetics, developmental biology, and biotechnology. However, achieving conditional activity of cytotoxins and maintaining the toxin-expressing plants as stably transformed lines remain challenging. Here, we produce a switchable version of the highly cytotoxic bacterial RNase barnase by fusing the protein to a portable protein degradation cassette, the low-temperature degron cassette. This method allows conditional genetics based on conditional protein degradation via the N-end rule or N-degron pathway and has been used to vice versa accumulate and/or deplete a diverse variety of highly active, unstable or stable target proteins in different living multicellular organisms and cell systems. Moreover, we expressed the barnase fusion under control of the trichome-specific <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> promoter. This enabled efficient temperature-dependent control of protein accumulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf hairs (trichomes). By tuning the levels of the protein, we were able to control the fate of trichomes in vivo. The on-demand formation of trichomes through manipulating the balance between stabilization and destabilization of barnase provides proof of concept for a robust and powerful tool for conditional switchable cell arrest. We present this tool as a potential strategy for the manufacture and accumulation of cytotoxic proteins and toxic high-value products in plants or for conditional genetic cell ablation.</p>

Vacuolar Phosphate Transporters Contribute to Systemic Phosphate Homeostasis Vital for Reproductive Development in Arabidopsis
<p>Vacuolar storage of phosphate (Pi) is essential for Pi homeostasis in plants. Recent studies have identified a family of vacuolar Pi transporters, VPTs (PHT5s), responsible for vacuolar sequestration of Pi. We report here that both VPT1 and VPT3 contribute to cytosol-to-vacuole Pi partitioning. Although VPT1 plays a predominant role, VPT3 is particularly important when VPT1 is absent. Our data suggested that the <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> double mutant was more defective in Pi homeostasis than the <i>vpt1</i> single mutant, as indicated by Pi accumulation capacity, vacuolar Pi influx, subcellular Pi allocation, and plant adaptability to changing Pi status. The remaining member of the VPT family, VPT2 (PHT5;2), did not appear to contribute to Pi homeostasis in such assays. Particularly interesting is the finding that the <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> double mutant was impaired in reproductive development with shortened siliques and impaired seed set under sufficient Pi, and this phenotype was not found in the <i>vpt1 vpt2</i> and <i>vpt2 vpt3</i> double mutants. Measurements of Pi contents revealed Pi over-accumulation in the floral organs of <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> as compared with the wild type. Further analysis identified excess Pi in the pistil as inhibitory to pollen tube growth, and thus seed yield, in the mutant plants. Reducing the Pi levels in culture medium or mutation of PHO1, a Pi transport protein responsible for root-shoot transport, restored the seed set of <i>vpt1 vpt3</i>. Thus, VPTs, through their function in vacuolar Pi sequestration, control the fine-tuning of systemic Pi allocation, which is particularly important for reproductive development.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of plants are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis modeling. However, the construction of accurate 3D plant models is challenging, as plants are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-based method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all plants, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target plant, tuning camera placement to match the plant’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic plant modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based plant reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different plant structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of plant types.</p>

The Polycomb-Group Repressor MEDEA Attenuates Pathogen Defense
<p>Plants recruit positive and negative regulators for fine tuning the balance between growth and development. Negative regulators of pathogen defense generally modulate defense hormone biosynthesis and signaling. Here, we report a mechanism for attenuation of the defense response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), which is mediated by the polycomb-group repressor MEDEA (MEA). Our results showed that pathogen inoculation or exogenous application of salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, or the bacterial 22-amino acid domain of flagellin peptide induces the expression of <i>MEA</i>. <i>MEA</i> expression was higher when plants were inoculated with the avirulent strain of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) carrying the <i>AvrRpt2</i> effector (<i>Pst-AvrRpt2</i>) compared to the virulent <i>Pst</i> strain. <i>MEA</i> remains suppressed during the vegetative phase via DNA and histone (H3K27) methylation, and only the maternal copy is expressed in the female gametophyte and endosperm via histone and DNA demethylation. In contrast, <i>Pst-AvrRpt2</i> induces high levels of <i>MEA</i> expression via hyper-accumulation of H3K4me3 at the <i>MEA</i> locus. <i>MEA</i>-overexpressing transgenic plants are susceptible to the fungal pathogen <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and bacterial pathogens <i>Pst</i> and <i>Pst-AvrRpt2</i>, whereas <i>mea</i> mutant plants are more resistant to bacterial pathogens. <i>AvrRpt2</i>-mediated immunity requires the function of RESISTANCE TO P. SYRINGAE2 (RPS2) in Arabidopsis. Using transcriptional analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we established that MEA directly targets <i>RPS2</i> and suppresses its transcription. We screened an Arabidopsis cDNA library using MEA as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay and identified DROUGHT-INDUCED19, a transcription factor that interacts with MEA and recruits it at the <i>RPS2</i> promoter. The results identified a previously unknown mechanism of defense response attenuation in plants.</p>

Thylakoid localization of aequorin-based probes in stably transformed lines was confirmed by confocal microscopy, immunogold labeling, and biochemical analyses. In resting conditions in the dark, free Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the thylakoid lumen were maintained at about 0.5 μ<sc>m</sc>, which was a 3- to 5-fold higher concentration than in the stroma. Monitoring of chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in different intrachloroplast subcompartments (stroma, thylakoid membrane, and thylakoid lumen) revealed the occurrence of stimulus-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, characterized by unique kinetic parameters. Oxidative and salt stresses initiated pronounced free Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in the thylakoid lumen. Localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases also were observed on the thylakoid membrane surface, mirroring transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes observed for the bulk stroma, but with specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Moreover, evidence was obtained for dark-stimulated intrathylakoid Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes, suggesting a new scenario for light-to-dark-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes inside chloroplasts. Hence, thylakoid-targeted aequorin reporters can provide new insights into chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage and signal transduction. These probes represent novel tools with which to investigate the role of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling networks within chloroplasts and plant cells.</p>

LRX Proteins Play a Crucial Role in Pollen Grain and Pollen Tube Cell Wall Development<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Leu-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) are chimeric proteins containing an N-terminal Leu-rich repeat (LRR) and a C-terminal extensin domain. LRXs are involved in cell wall formation in vegetative tissues and required for plant growth. However, the nature of their role in these cellular processes remains to be elucidated. Here, we used a combination of molecular techniques, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to characterize mutants of pollen-expressed <i>LRXs</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>). Mutations in multiple pollen-expressed <i>lrx</i> genes cause severe defects in pollen germination and pollen tube growth, resulting in a reduced seed set. Physiological experiments demonstrate that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability partially suppresses the pollen tube growth defects, suggesting that LRX proteins influence Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related processes. Furthermore, we show that LRX protein localizes to the cell wall, and its LRR-domain (which likely mediates protein-protein interactions) is associated with the plasma membrane. Mechanical analyses by cellular force microscopy and finite element method-based modeling revealed significant changes in the material properties of the cell wall and the fine-tuning of cellular biophysical parameters in the mutants compared to the wild type. The results indicate that LRX proteins might play a role in cell wall-plasma membrane communication, influencing cell wall formation and cellular mechanics.</p>

Fine-Tuning of Photosynthesis Requires CURVATURE THYLAKOID1-Mediated Thylakoid Plasticity
<p>The thylakoid membrane system of higher plant chloroplasts consists of interconnected subdomains of appressed and nonappressed membrane bilayers, known as grana and stroma lamellae, respectively. CURVATURE THYLAKOID1 (CURT1) protein complexes mediate the shape of grana stacks in a dosage-dependent manner and facilitate membrane curvature at the grana margins, the interface between grana and stroma lamellae. Although grana stacks are highly conserved among land plants, the functional relevance of grana stacking remains unclear. Here, we show that inhibiting CURT1-mediated alteration of thylakoid ultrastructure in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reduces photosynthetic efficiency and plant fitness under adverse, controlled, and natural light conditions. Plants that lack CURT1 show less adjustment of grana diameter, which compromises regulatory mechanisms like the photosystem II repair cycle and state transitions. Interestingly, CURT1A suffices to induce thylakoid membrane curvature in planta and thylakoid hyperbending in plants overexpressing CURT1A. We suggest that CURT1 oligomerization is regulated at the posttranslational level in a light-dependent fashion and that CURT1-mediated thylakoid plasticity plays an important role in fine-tuning photosynthesis and plant fitness during challenging growth conditions.</p>

Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p>Flooding is detrimental for nearly all higher plants, including crops. The compound stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light levels under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to plant death. The endogenous concentrations of four gaseous compounds, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and nitric oxide, change during the submergence of plant organs in water. These gases play a pivotal role in signal transduction cascades, leading to adaptive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these gases, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early flooding stress, most likely in tight interaction with the other gases. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells during flooding and directly after subsidence, during which the plant is confronted with high light and oxygen levels, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled levels of ROS are essential for adaptive signaling pathways, in interaction with the other gaseous flooding signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for plants. Therefore, a fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong>d balance is important, with a major role for ROS production and scavenging. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four gases and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing flooding conditions and subsequent adaptive responses.</p>

The Kinase OsCPK4 Regulates a Buffering Mechanism That Fine-Tunes Innate Immunity
<p>The calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 has been demonstrated to play important roles in salt and drought tolerance, plant growth, and development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying OsCPK4 function in rice immunity. In this study, we demonstrated that the generation of oxidative burst and pathogenesis-related gene expression triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns were significantly enhanced in the <i>oscpk4</i> mutants. These mutant lines are more resistant to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases than the wild-type plants, indicating that OsCPK4 negatively regulates innate immunity in rice. OsCPK4 was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176. OsRLCK176 accumulation is negatively regulated by OsCPK4. Interestingly, the kinase-dead OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation more strongly than the wild-type protein. OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 mutually phosphorylate each other and form a feedback loop. Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 contribute to the stability of OsRLCK176. These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation and restricts plant defenses, whereas the activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 degradation machinery, thus enhancing plant immunity. Collectively, the study proposes a novel defense buffering mechanism mediated by OsCPK4, which fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong>s microbe-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice.</p>

A Role for the F-Box Protein HAWAIIAN SKIRT in Plant microRNA Function
<p>As regulators of gene expression in multicellular organisms, microRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial for growth and development. Although a plethora of factors involved in their biogenesis and action in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) has been described, these processes and their fine-tuning are not fully understood. Here, we used plants expressing an artificial miRNA target mimic (MIM) to screen for negative regulators of miR156. We identified a new mutant allele of the F-box gene <i>HAWAIIAN SKIRT</i> (<i>HWS</i>; At3G61590), <i>hws</i>-<i>5</i>, as a suppressor of the <i>MIM156</i>-induced developmental and molecular phenotypes. In <i>hws</i> plants, levels of some endogenous miRNAs are increased and their mRNA targets decreased. Plants constitutively expressing full-length HWS—but not a truncated version lacking the F-box domain—display morphological and molecular phenotypes resembling those of mutants defective in miRNA biogenesis and activity. In combination with such mutants, <i>hws</i> loses its delayed floral organ abscission (“skirt”) phenotype, suggesting epistasis. Also, the <i>hws</i> transcriptome profile partially resembles those of well-known miRNA mutants <i>hyl1</i>-<i>2</i>, <i>se</i>-<i>3</i>, and <i>ago1</i>-<i>27</i>, pointing to a role in a common pathway. We thus propose HWS as a novel, F-box dependent factor involved in miRNA function.</p>

<i>S5H/DMR6</i> Encodes a Salicylic Acid 5-Hydroxylase That Fine-Tunes Salicylic Acid Homeostasis
<p>The phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) plays essential roles in biotic and abiotic responses, plant development, and leaf senescence. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA or gentisic acid) is one of the most commonly occurring aromatic acids in green plants and is assumed to be generated from SA, but the enzymes involved in its production remain obscure. DMR6 (Downy Mildew Resistant6; At5g24530) has been proven essential in plant immunity of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but its biochemical properties are not well understood. Here, we report the discovery and functional characterization of DMR6 as a salicylic acid 5-hydroxylase (S5H) that catalyzes the formation of 2,5-DHBA by hydroxylating SA at the C5 position of its phenyl ring in Arabidopsis. S5H/DMR6 specifically converts SA to 2,5-DHBA in vitro and displays higher catalytic efficiency (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 4.96 × 10<sup>4</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) than the previously reported S3H (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 6.09 × 10<sup>3</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) for SA. Interestingly, S5H/DMR6 displays a substrate inhibition property that may enable automatic control of its enzyme activities. The <i>s5h</i> mutant and <i>s5hs3h</i> double mutant overaccumulate SA and display phenotypes such as a smaller growth size, early senescence, and a loss of susceptibility to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. <i>S5H</i>/<i>DMR6</i> is sensitively induced by SA/pathogen treatment and is expressed widely from young seedlings to senescing plants, whereas <i>S3H</i> is more specifically expressed at the mature and senescing stages.

Cooperative Regulatory Functions of miR858 and MYB83 during Cyst Nematode Parasitism
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) recently have been established as key regulators of transcriptome reprogramming that define cell function and identity. Nevertheless, the molecular functions of the greatest number of miRNA genes remain to be determined. Here, we report cooperative regulatory functions of miR858 and its MYB83 transcription factor target gene in transcriptome reprogramming during <i>Heterodera</i> cyst nematode parasitism of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Gene expression analyses and promoter-GUS fusion assays documented a role of miR858 in posttranscriptional regulation of <i>MYB83</i> in the <i>Heterodera schachtii-</i>induced feeding sites, the syncytia. Constitutive overexpression of miR858 interfered with <i>H. schachtii</i> parasitism of Arabidopsis, leading to reduced susceptibility, while reduced miR858 abundance enhanced plant susceptibility. Similarly, <i>MYB83</i> expression increases were conducive to nematode infection because overexpression of a noncleavable coding sequence of <i>MYB83</i> significantly increased plant susceptibility, whereas a <i>myb83</i> mutation rendered the plants less susceptible. In addition, RNA-seq analysis revealed that genes involved in hormone signaling pathways, defense response, glucosinolate biosynthesis, cell wall modification, sugar transport, and transcriptional control are the key etiological factors by which MYB83 facilitates nematode parasitism of Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we discovered that miR858-mediated silencing of <i>MYB83</i> is tightly regulated through a feedback loop that might contribute to fine-tuning the expression of more than a thousand of MYB83-regulated genes in the <i>H. schachtii</i>-induced syncytium. Together, our results suggest a role of the miR858-MYB83 regulatory system in finely balancing gene expression patterns during <i>H. schachtii</i> parasitism of Arabidopsis to ensure optimal cellular function.</p>

Impaired Mitochondrial Transcription Termination Disrupts the Stromal Redox Poise in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In photosynthetic eukaryotes, the metabolite exchange between chloroplast and mitochondria ensures efficient photosynthesis under saturating light conditions. The <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> mutant <i>stm6</i> is devoid of the mitochondrial transcription termination factor MOC1 and aberrantly expresses the mitochondrial genome, resulting in enhanced photosynthetic hydrogen production and diminished light tolerance. We analyzed the modulation of mitochondrial and chlororespiration during the acclimation of <i>stm6</i> and the <i>MOC1</i>-complemented strain to excess light. Although light stress stimulated mitochondrial respiration via the energy-conserving cytochrome <i>c</i> pathway in both strains, the mutant was unable to fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong> the expression and activity of oxidative phosphorylation complex I in excess light, which was accompanied by an increased mitochondrial respiration via the alternative oxidase pathway. Furthermore, <i>stm6</i> failed to fully activate chlororespiration and cyclic electron flow due to a more oxidized state of the chloroplast stroma, which is caused by an increased mitochondrial electron sink capacity. Increased susceptibility to photoinhibition of PSII in <i>stm6</i> demonstrates that the MOC1-dependent modulation of mitochondrial respiration helps control the stromal redox poise as a crucial part of high-light acclimation in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>.</p>

Temperature-Induced Remodeling of the Photosynthetic Machinery Tunes Photosynthesis in the Thermophilic Alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i>
<p>The thermophilic alga <i>C. merolae</i> thrives in extreme environments (low pH and temperature between 40°C and 56°C). In this study, we investigated the acclimation process of the alga to a colder temperature (25°C). A long-term cell growth experiment revealed an extensive remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus in the first 250 h of acclimation, which was followed by cell growth to an even higher density than the control (grown at 42°C) cell density. Once the cells were shifted to the lower temperature, the proteins of the light-harvesting antenna were greatly down-regulated and the phycobilisome composition was altered. The amount of PSI and PSII subunits was also decreased, but the chlorophyll to photosystems ratio remained unchanged. The 25°C cells possessed a less efficient photon-to-oxygen conversion rate and require a 2.5 times higher light intensity to reach maximum photosynthetic efficiency. With respect to chlorophyll, however, the photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate of the 25°C culture was 2 times higher than the control. Quantitative proteomics revealed that acclimation requires, besides remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus, also adjustment of the machinery for protein folding, degradation, and homeostasis. In summary, these remodeling processes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong>d photosynthesis according to the demands placed on the system and revealed the capability of <i>C. merolae</i> to grow under a broad range of temperatures.</p>

Abscisic Acid Induces Resistance against <i>Bamboo Mosaic Virus</i> through <i>Argonaute</i> <i>2</i> and <i>3</i>
<p>Plant resistance to pathogens is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong>d by defense-related hormones. Of these, abscisic acid (ABA) is well documented to moderate resistance against fungi and bacteria. However, ABA’s contribution to resistance against viruses is pleiotropic. ABA affects callose deposition at plasmodesmata (therefore hindering the viral cell-to-cell movement), but here, we show that when callose synthase is down-regulated, ABA still induces resistance against infection with <i>Bamboo mosaic virus</i> (BaMV). By examining the potential connections between the ABA and RNA-silencing pathways in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we showed that ABA regulates the expression of almost the whole ARGONAUTE (AGO) gene family, of which some are required for plant resistance against BaMV. Our data show that BaMV infection and ABA treatment regulate the same set of AGOs, with positive effects on <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i>, no effect on <i>AGO7</i>, and negative effects on <i>AGO4</i> and <i>AGO10</i>. The BaMV-mediated regulation of <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i> is ABA dependent, because the accumulation of these <i>AGOs</i> in BaMV-infected ABA mutants did not reach the levels observed in infected wild-type plants. In addition, the <i>AGO1</i>-<i>miR168a</i> complex is dispensable for BaMV resistance, while <i>AGO2</i> and <i>AGO3</i> were important for ABA-mediated resistance. While most <i>ago</i> mutants showed increased susceptibility to BaMV infection (except <i>ago10</i>), <i>ago1-27</i> showed reduced BaMV titers, which was attributed to the up-regulated levels of <i>AGO2</i>, <i>AGO3</i>, and <i>AGO4</i>. We have established that ABA regulates the expression of several members of the AGO family, and this regulation partially contributes to ABA-mediated resistance against BaMV. These findings reveal another role for ABA in plants.</p>

Here, we sought proteins responsible for degradation of the pepper (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>) type 2C protein phosphatase CaADIP1 via the 26S proteasome system. We showed that the RING-type E3 ligase CaAIRF1 (<i>Capsicum annuum</i> ADIP1 Interacting RING Finger Protein 1) interacts with and ubiquitinates CaADIP1. CaADIP1 degradation was slower in crude proteins from <i>CaAIRF1</i>-silenced peppers than in those from control plants. <i>CaAIRF1</i>-silenced pepper plants displayed reduced ABA sensitivity and decreased drought tolerance characterized by delayed stomatal closure and suppressed induction of ABA- and drought-responsive marker genes. In contrast, <i>CaAIRF1</i>-overexpressing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants exhibited ABA-hypersensitive and drought-tolerant phenotypes. Moreover, in these plants, CaADIP1-induced ABA hyposensitivity was strongly suppressed by <i>CaAIRF1</i> overexpression.

Glycerolipid Characterization and Nutrient Deprivation-Associated Changes in the Green Picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i>
<p>The picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i> is a minimal photosynthetic eukaryote that has been used as a model system. <i>O. tauri</i> is known to efficiently produce docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We provide a comprehensive study of the glycerolipidome of <i>O. tauri</i> and validate this species as model for related picoeukaryotes. <i>O. tauri</i> lipids displayed unique features that combined traits from the green and the chromalveolate lineages. The betaine lipid diacylglyceryl-hydroxymethyl-trimethyl-β-alanine and phosphatidyldimethylpropanethiol, both hallmarks of chromalveolates, were identified as presumed extraplastidial lipids. DHA was confined to these lipids, while plastidial lipids of prokaryotic type were characterized by the overwhelming presence of ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs), 18:5 being restricted to galactolipids. C16:4, an FA typical of green microalgae galactolipids, also was a major component of <i>O. tauri</i> extraplastidial lipids, while the 16:4-coenzyme A (CoA) species was not detected. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) displayed the complete panel of FAs, and many species exhibited combinations of FAs diagnostic for plastidial and extraplastidial lipids. Importantly, under nutrient deprivation, 16:4 and ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated FAs accumulated into de novo synthesized TAGs while DHA-TAG species remained rather stable, indicating an increased contribution of FAs of plastidial origin to TAG synthesis. Nutrient deprivation further severely down-regulated the conversion of 18:3 to 18:4, resulting in obvious inversion of the 18:3/18:4 ratio in plastidial lipids, TAGs, as well as acyl-CoAs. The fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong>d and dynamic regulation of the 18:3/18:4 ratio suggested an important physiological role of these FAs in photosynthetic membranes.

ABA Suppresses Root Hair Growth via the OBP4 Transcriptional Regulator
<p>Plants modify organ growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong> morphogenesis in response to various endogenous and environmental cues. At the cellular level, organ growth is often adjusted by alterations in cell growth, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this control remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify the DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (DOF)-type transcription regulator OBF BINDING PROTEIN4 (OBP4) as a repressor of cell growth. Ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inhibits cell growth, resulting in severe dwarfism and the repression of genes involved in the regulation of water transport, root hair development, and stress responses. Among the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors known to control root hair growth, OBP4 binds the <i>ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE6-LIKE2</i> (<i>RSL2</i>) promoter to repress its expression. The accumulation of OBP4 proteins is detected in expanding root epidermal cells, and its expression level is increased by the application of abscisic acid (ABA) at concentrations sufficient to inhibit root hair growth. ABA-dependent induction of <i>OBP4</i> is associated with the reduced expression of <i>RSL2</i>. Furthermore, ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> or loss of <i>RSL2</i> function results in ABA-insensitive root hair growth. Taken together, our results suggest that OBP4-mediated transcriptional repression of <i>RSL2</i> contributes to the ABA-dependent inhibition of root hair growth in Arabidopsis.</p>

Connecting the Molecular Structure of Cutin to Ultrastructure and Physical Properties of the Cuticle in Petals of Arabidopsis
<p>The plant cuticle is laid down at the cell wall surface of epidermal cells in a wide variety of structures, but the functional significance of this architectural diversity is not yet understood. Here, the structure-function relationship of the petal cuticle of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was investigated. Applying Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, the cutin mutants <i>long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetase2</i> (<i>lacs2</i>), <i>permeable cuticle1 (pec1)</i>, <i>cyp77a6</i>, <i>glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase6</i> (<i>gpat6</i>), and <i>defective in cuticular ridges</i> (<i>dcr</i>) were grouped in three separate classes based on quantitative differences in the ν(C=O) and ν(C-H) band <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ions. These were associated mainly with the quantity of 10,16-dihydroxy hexadecanoic acid, a monomer of the cuticle polyester, cutin. These spectral features were linked to three different types of cuticle organization: a normal cuticle with nanoridges (<i>lacs2</i> and <i>pec1</i> mutants); a broad translucent cuticle (<i>cyp77a6</i> and <i>dcr</i> mutants); and an electron-opaque multilayered cuticle (<i>gpat6</i> mutant). The latter two types did not have typical nanoridges. Transmission electron microscopy revealed considerable variations in cuticle thickness in the <i>dcr</i> mutant. Different double mutant combinations showed that a low amount of C16 monomers in cutin leads to the appearance of an electron-translucent layer adjacent to the cuticle proper, which is independent of DCR action. We concluded that DCR is not only essential for incorporating 10,16-dihydroxy C16:0 into cutin but also plays a crucial role in the organization of the cuticle, independent of cutin composition. Further characterization of the mutant petals suggested that nanoridge formation and conical cell shape may contribute to the reduction of physical adhesion forces between petals and other floral organs during floral development.</p>

The OsMYB30 Transcription Factor Suppresses Cold Tolerance by Interacting with a JAZ Protein and Suppressing <i>β</i>-Amylase Expression
<p>Cold stress is one of the major limiting factors for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) productivity. Several MYB transcriptional factors have been reported as important regulators in the cold stress response, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we characterized a cold-responsive R2R3-type MYB gene, <i>OsMYB30</i>, for its regulatory function in cold tolerance in rice. Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of <i>OsMYB30</i> in rice resulted in increased cold sensitivity, while the <i>osmyb30</i> knockout mutant showed increased cold tolerance. Microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that a few β-amylase (<i>BMY</i>) genes were down-regulated by OsMYB30. The <i>BMY</i> activity and maltose content, which were decreased and increased in the <i>OsMYB30</i> overexpression and <i>osmyb30</i> knockout mutant, respectively, were correlated with the expression patterns of the <i>BMY</i> genes. OsMYB30 was shown to bind to the promoters of the <i>BMY</i> genes. These results suggested that OsMYB30 exhibited a regulatory effect on the breakdown of starch through the regulation of the <i>BMY</i> genes. In addition, application of maltose had a protective effect for cell membranes under cold stress conditions. Furthermore, we identified an OsMYB30-interacting protein, OsJAZ9, that had a significant effect in suppressing the transcriptional activation of OsMYB30 and in the repression of <i>BMY</i> genes mediated by OsMYB30.

Combined Experimental and Computational Approaches Reveal Distinct pH Dependence of Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors
<p>The fine-tuning of the degree of methylesterification of cell wall pectin is a key to regulating cell elongation and ultimately the shape of the plant body. Pectin methylesterification is spatiotemporally controlled by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; 66 members in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]). The comparably large number of proteinaceous pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs; 76 members in Arabidopsis) questions the specificity of the PME-PMEI interaction and the functional role of such abundance. To understand the difference, or redundancy, between PMEIs, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the behavior of two PMEIs that are coexpressed and have distinct effects on plant development: AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9. Simulations revealed the structural determinants of the pH dependence for the interaction of these inhibitors with AtPME3, a major PME expressed in roots. Key residues that are likely to play a role in the pH dependence were identified. The predictions obtained from MD simulations were confirmed in vitro, showing that AtPMEI9 is a stronger, less pH-independent inhibitor compared with AtPMEI4. Using pollen tubes as a developmental model, we showed that these biochemical differences have a biological significance. Application of purified proteins at pH ranges in which PMEI inhibition differed between AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9 had distinct consequences on pollen tube elongation. Therefore, MD simulations have proven to be a powerful tool to predict functional diversity between PMEIs, allowing the discovery of a strategy that may be used by PMEIs to inhibit PMEs in different microenvironmental conditions and paving the way to identify the specific role of PMEI diversity in muro.</p>

<p><i>Phosphate overaccumulator2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>) encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme that is a major negative regulator of the inorganic phosphate (Pi)-starvation response-signaling pathway. A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; Os) using OsPHO2 as bait revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and two h-type thioredoxins, OsTrxh1 and OsTrxh4. These interactions were confirmed in vivo using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) of OsPHO2 and OsTrxh1/h4 in rice protoplasts and by in vitro pull-down assays with 6His-tagged OsTrxh1/h4 and GST-tagged OsPHO2. Y2H assays revealed that amino acid Cys-445 of OsPHO2 and an N-terminal Cys in the “WCGPC” motif of Trxhs were required for the interaction. Split-ubiquitin Y2H analyses and BiFC assays in rice protoplasts confirmed the interaction of OsPHO2 with PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (OsPHF1), and PHOSPHATE1;2 (OsPHO1;2) in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membrane system, where OsPHO2 mediates the degradation of OsPHF1 in both tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and rice seedlings. Characterization of rice <i>pho2</i> complemented lines, transformed with an endogenous genomic <i>OsPHO2</i> or <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> (a constitutively reduced form) fragment, indicated that <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> restored Pi concentration in rice to statistically significant lower levels compared to native <i>OsPHO2</i>. Moreover, the suppression of <i>OsTrxh1</i> (knockdown and knockout) resulted in slightly higher Pi concentration than that of wild-type Nipponbare in leaves. These results demonstrate that OsPHO2 is under redox control by thioredoxins, which fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong> its activity and link Pi homeostasis with redox balance in rice.</p>

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A deeper understanding of the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is crucial in tailoring digestibility without sacrificing grain quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were identified through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched starch structure from grains of a 320 <i>indica</i> rice diversity panel using genotyping data from the high-density rice array. A systems genetics approach that interrelates starch structure data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network identified known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound Starch Synthase I</i> was identified along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch structure with starch digestibility by determining the kinetics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch structure with estimated digestibility kinetics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, systems genetics, and digestibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch structure in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the digestibility of rice grain, thus offering rice consumers a new diet-based intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

Regulation of Vegetative Phase Change by SWI2/SNF2 Chromatin Remodeling ATPase BRAHMA
<p>Plants progress from a juvenile vegetative phase of development to an adult vegetative phase of development before they enter the reproductive phase. miR156 has been shown to be the master regulator of the juvenile-to-adult transition in plants. However, the mechanism of how miR156 is transcriptionally regulated still remains elusive. In a forward genetic screen, we identified that a mutation in the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) exhibited an accelerated vegetative phase change phenotype by reducing the expression of miR156, which in turn caused a corresponding increase in the levels of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> genes. BRM regulates miR156 expression by directly binding to the <i>MIR156A</i> promoter. Mutations in <i>BRM</i> not only increased occupancy of the −2 and +1 nucleosomes proximal to the transcription start site at the <i>MIR156A</i> locus but also the levels of trimethylated histone H3 at Lys 27. The precocious phenotype of <i>brm</i> mutant was partially suppressed by a second mutation in <i>SWINGER</i> (<i>SWN</i>), but not by a mutation in <i>CURLEY LEAF</i>, both of which are key components of the Polycomb Group Repressive Complex 2 in plants. Our results indicate that BRM and SWN act antagonistically at the nucleosome level to fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong> the temporal expression of miR156 to regulate vegetative phase change in Arabidopsis.</p>

Phloem Transport of the Receptor DWARF14 Protein Is Required for Full Function of Strigolactones<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The cell-to-cell transport of signaling molecules is essential for multicellular organisms to coordinate the action of their cells. Recent studies identified DWARF14 (D14) as a receptor of strigolactones (SLs), molecules that act as plant hormones and inhibit shoot branching. Here, we demonstrate that <i>RAMOSUS3</i>, a pea ortholog of <i>D14</i>, works as a graft-transmissible signal to suppress shoot branching. In addition, we show that D14 protein is contained in phloem sap and transported through the phloem to axillary buds in rice. SLs are not required for the transport of D14 protein. Disruption of D14 transport weakens the suppression of axillary bud outgrowth of rice. Taken together, we conclude that the D14 protein works as an intercellular signaling molecule to fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tune</span></strong> SL function. Our findings provide evidence that the intercellular transport of a receptor can regulate the action of plant hormones.</p>

Fine-Tuning Motile Cilia and Flagella: Evolution of the Dynein Motor Proteins from Plants to Humans at High Resolution
<p>The flagellum is a key innovation linked to eukaryogenesis. It provides motility by regulated cycles of bending and bend propagation, which are thought to be controlled by a complex arrangement of seven distinct dyneins in repeated patterns of outer- (OAD) and inner-arm dynein (IAD) complexes. Electron tomography showed high similarity of this axonemal repeat pattern across ciliates, algae, and animals, but the diversity of dynein sequences across the eukaryotes has not yet comprehensively been resolved and correlated with structural data. To shed light on the evolution of the axoneme I performed an exhaustive analysis of dyneins using the available sequenced genome data. Evidence from motor domain phylogeny allowed expanding the current set of nine dynein subtypes by eight additional isoforms with, however, restricted taxonomic distributions. I confirmed the presence of the nine dyneins in all eukaryotic super-groups indicating their origin predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor. The comparison of the N-terminal tail domains revealed a most likely axonemal dynein origin of the new classes, a group of chimeric dyneins in plants/algae and Stramenopiles, and the unique domain architecture and origin of the outermost OADs present in green algae and ciliates but not animals. The correlation of sequence and structural data suggests the single-headed class-8 and class-9 dyneins to localize to the distal end of the axonemal repeat and the class-7 dyneins filling the region up to the proximal heterodimeric IAD. Tracing dynein gene duplications across the eukaryotes indicated ongoing diversification and fine-tuning of flagellar functions in extant taxa and species.</p>

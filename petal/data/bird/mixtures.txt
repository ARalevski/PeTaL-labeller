Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven stresses such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these stresses usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single stresses. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, drought, and heat stresses, as well as their double and triple stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-physiological acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed stresses. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat stress. Response patterns of differentially expressed genes, under single and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed stresses (i.e. common stress genes), were maintained only among 37% of the genes, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between common stress genes and genes that were uniquely expressed only under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed stresses (i.e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation unique genes) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed stresses and limited ability to predict plant responses as different stresses are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each gene subset was enriched with different biological processes. Common stress genes were enriched with known stress response pathways, while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation unique-genes were enriched with unique processes and genes with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve stress tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor ductility owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made ductile by specific dilute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued plastic straining during deformation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for ductility as a function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong> composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong>s, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium. The mechanistic theory can quickly screen for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong> compositions favoring conditions for high ductility and may help in the development of high-formability magnesium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong>s.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p>Metals that are active catalysts for methane (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–melting temperature metals (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong> catalysts for pyrolysis of methane into hydrogen and carbon. All solid catalysts previously used for this reaction have been deactivated by carbon deposition. In the molten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong> system, the in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e carbon floats to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong> achieved 95% methane conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure hydrogen without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products. Calculations show that the active metals in the molten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong>s are atomically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed and negatively charged. There is a correlation between the amount of charge on the atoms and their catalytic activity.</p>

Carbon dynamics of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under drought and complete darkness
<p>Carbon (C) storage is considered a key component to plant survival under drought and shade, although the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed effects of these factors on survival remain poorly understood. We investigated how drought and shade alter the C dynamics and survival of tree seedlings, and whether drought limits the access to or usage of stored C. We experimentally applied two levels of soil humidity (well-watered versus drought, the latter induced by dry-down) and light availability (light versus complete darkness) on 1-year-old seedlings of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L. for 3 months. We quantified the survival, biomass, growth rate and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) of seedlings at their time of death or at the end of the experiment for those that survived. We found that the soil dried out faster when drought was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed with light than when it was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed with complete darkness. Seedlings subjected to both drought and light showed reduced growth and reached 100% mortality earlier than any other treatment, with the highest NSC concentrations at the time of death. Seedlings exposed to both drought and complete darkness died significantly earlier than seedlings exposed to complete darkness only, but had similar NSC concentrations at time of their death, suggesting that drought accelerated the use of stored C under complete darkness. Complete darkness significantly reduced seedling growth and whole-plant NSC concentrations regardless of soil humidity, while root NSC concentrations were significantly more reduced when complete darkness was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed with drought conditions. Thus, the C dynamics in <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under complete darkness was not hindered by drought, i.e., the access and use of stored C was not limited by drought. The contrasting growth and C storage responses driven by drought under light versus complete darkness are consistent with a key role of the drought progression in the C dynamics of trees.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Soluble gp130 prevents interleukin-6 and interleukin-11 cluster signaling but not intracellular autocrine responses
<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine of the IL-6 family, members of which signal through a complex of a cytokine-specific receptor and the signal-transducing subunit gp130. The interaction of IL-6 with the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and gp130 stimulates “classic signaling,” whereas the binding of IL-6 and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e version of the IL-6R to gp130 stimulates “trans-signaling.” Alternatively, “cluster signaling” occurs when membrane-bound IL-6:IL-6R complexes on transmitter cells activate gp130 receptors on neighboring receiver cells. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e form of gp130 (sgp130) is a selective trans-signaling inhibitor, but it does not affect classic signaling. We demonstrated that the interaction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e gp130 with natural and synthetic membrane-bound IL-6:IL-6R complexes inhibited IL-6 cluster signaling. Similarly, IL-11 cluster signaling through the IL-11R to gp130 was also inhibited by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e gp130. However, autocrine classic and trans-signaling was not inhibited by extracellular inhibitors such as sgp130 or gp130 antibodies. Together, our results suggest that autocrine IL-6 signaling may occur intracellularly.</p>

Inhibition of the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1 causes G<sub>2</sub>-M cell cycle arrest and enhanced vincristine sensitivity in Ewing’s sarcoma
<p>Ewing’s sarcoma (ES) is a rare and highly malignant cancer that grows in the bones or surrounding tissues mostly affecting adolescents and young adults. A chimeric fusion between the RNA binding protein EWS and the ETS family transcription factor FLI1 (EWS-FLI1), which is generated from a chromosomal translocation, is implicated in driving most ES cases by modulation of transcription and alternative splicing. The small-molecule YK-4-279 inhibits EWS-FLI1 function and induces apoptosis in ES cells. We aimed to identify both the underlying mechanism of the drug and potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation therapies that might enhance its antitumor activity. We tested 69 anticancer drugs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation with YK-4-279 and found that vinca alkaloids exhibited synergy with YK-4-279 in five ES cell lines. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation of YK-4-279 and vincristine reduced tumor burden and increased survival in mice bearing ES xenografts. We determined that independent drug-induced events converged to cause this synergistic therapeutic effect. YK-4-279 rapidly induced G<sub>2</sub>-M arrest, increased the abundance of cyclin B1, and decreased EWS-FLI1–mediated generation of microtubule-associated proteins, which rendered cells more susceptible to microtubule depolymerization by vincristine. YK-4-279 reduced the expression of the EWS-FLI1 target gene encoding the ubiquitin ligase UBE2C, which, in part, contributed to the increase in cyclin B1. YK-4-279 also increased the abundance of proapoptotic isoforms of MCL1 and BCL2, presumably through inhibition of alternative splicing by EWS-FLI1, thus promoting cell death in response to vincristine. Thus, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation of vincristine and YK-4-279 might be therapeutically effective in ES patients.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin coating either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Precipitation strengthening of aluminum alloys by room-temperature cyclic plasticity
<p>High-strength aluminum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong>s are important for lightweighting vehicles and are extensively used in aircraft and, increasingly, in automobiles. The highest-strength aluminum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong>s require a series of high-temperature “bakes” (120° to 200°C) to form a high number density of nanoparticles by solid-state precipitation. We found that a controlled, room-temperature cyclic deformation is sufficient to continuously inject vacancies into the material and to mediate the dynamic precipitation of a very fine (1- to 2-nanometer) distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e clusters. This results in better material strength and elongation properties relative to traditional thermal treatments, despite a much shorter processing time. The microstructures formed are much more uniform than those characteristic of traditional thermal treatments and do not exhibit precipitate-free zones. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong>s are therefore likely to be more resistant to damage.</p>

Multivalent counterions diminish the lubricity of polyelectrolyte brushes
<p>Polyelectrolyte brushes provide wear protection and lubrication in many technical, medical, physiological, and biological applications. Wear resistance and low friction are attributed to counterion osmotic pressure and the hydration layer surrounding the charged polymer segments. However, the presence of multivalent counterions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion can strongly affect the interchain interactions and structural properties of brush layers. We evaluated the lubrication properties of polystyrene sulfonate brush layers sliding against each other in aqueous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions containing increasing concentrations of counterions. The presence of multivalent ions (Y<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>), even at minute concentrations, markedly increases the friction forces between brush layers owing to electrostatic bridging and brush collapse. Our results suggest that the lubricating properties of polyelectrolyte brushes in multivalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion are hindered relative to those in monovalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion.</p>

Giant nonlinear response at a plasmonic nanofocus drives efficient four-wave mixing
<p>Efficient optical frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing typically must accumulate over large interaction lengths because nonlinear responses in natural materials are inherently weak. This limits the efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing processes owing to the requirement of phase matching. Here, we report efficient four-wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing (FWM) over micrometer-scale interaction lengths at telecommunications wavelengths on silicon. We used an integrated plasmonic gap waveguide that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer. The gap waveguide intensifies light by nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometers, thus generating a nonlinear response so strong that efficient FWM accumulates over wavelength-scale distances. This technique opens up nonlinear optics to a regime of relaxed phase matching, with the possibility of compact, broadband, and efficient frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing integrated with silicon photonics.</p>

Soluble and Membrane-Bound β-Glucosidases Are Involved in Trimming the Xyloglucan Backbone
<p>In many flowering plants, xyloglucan is a major component of primary cell walls, where it plays an important role in growth regulation. Xyloglucan can be degraded by a suite of exoglycosidases that remove specific sugars. In this work, we show that the xyloglucan backbone, formed by (1→4)-linked β-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl residues, can be attacked by two different Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) β-glucosidases from glycoside hydrolase family 3. While BGLC1 (At5g20950; for β-glucosidase active against xyloglucan 1) is responsible for all or most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e activity, BGLC3 (At5g04885) is usually a membrane-anchored protein. Mutations in these two genes, whether on their own or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed with mutations in other exoglycosidase genes, resulted in the accumulation of partially digested xyloglucan subunits, such as GXXG, GXLG, or GXFG. While a mutation in <i>BGLC1</i> had significant effects on its own, lack of <i>BGLC3</i> had only minor effects. On the other hand, double <i>bglc1 bglc3</i> mutants revealed a synergistic interaction that supports a role for membrane-bound BGLC3 in xyloglucan metabolism. In addition, <i>bglc1 bglc3</i> was complemented by overexpression of either <i>BGLC1</i> or <i>BGLC3</i>. In overexpression lines, BGLC3 activity was concentrated in a microsome-enriched fraction but also was present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e form. Finally, both genes were generally expressed in the same cell types, although, in some cases, <i>BGLC3</i> was expressed at earlier stages than <i>BGLC1</i>. We propose that functional specialization could explain the separate localization of both enzymes, as a membrane-bound β-glucosidase could specifically digest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e xyloglucan without affecting the wall-bound polymer.</p>

Unique function of a chemosensory protein in the proboscis of two <i>Helicoverpa</i> species
<p>Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e proteins found only in arthropods. Some of them fill the lumen of chemosensilla and are believed to play a role similar to that of odorant-binding proteins in the detection of semiochemicals. Other members of the CSP family have been reported to perform different functions, from delivery of pheromones to development. This report is focused on a member (CSP4) of the family that is highly and almost exclusively present in the proboscis of two sibling noctuid species, <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> and <i>H. assulta</i>. We expressed the protein in bacteria and measured binding to terpenoids and related compounds. Using specific antibodies, we found that when the moths suck on a sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion, CSP4 is partly extruded from the proboscis. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion of protein can also fill a hydrophobic tube of same length and diameter as the proboscis by capillary action. On this basis, we suggest that CSP4 acts as a wetting agent to reduce the surface tension of aqueous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions and consequently the pressure involved in sucking.</p>

Blockade of TNFR2 signaling enhances the immunotherapeutic effect of CpG ODN in a mouse model of colon cancer
<p>Through the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type II (TNFR2), TNF preferentially activates, expands, and promotes the phenotypic stability of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells. Those T<sub>reg</sub> cells that have a high abundance of TNFR2 have the maximal immunosuppressive capacity. We investigated whether targeting TNFR2 could effectively suppress the activity of T<sub>reg</sub> cells and consequently enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. We found that, relative to a suboptimal dose of the immunostimulatory Toll-like receptor 9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation of the suboptimal dose of CpG ODN with the TNFR2-blocking antibody M861 more markedly inhibited the growth of subcutaneously grafted mouse CT26 colon tumor cells. This resulted in markedly fewer TNFR2<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells and more interferon-γ–positive (IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrating the tumor and improved long-term tumor-free survival in the mouse cohort. Tumor-free mice were resistant to rechallenge by the same but not unrelated (4T1 breast cancer) cells. Treatment with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation of TNFR2-blocking antibody and a CD25-targeted antibody also resulted in enhanced inhibition of tumor growth in a syngeneic 4T1 mouse model of breast cancer. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation of a TNFR2 inhibitor and an immunotherapeutic stimulant may represent a more effective treatment strategy for various cancers.</p>

Carrier lifetimes of >1 μs in Sn-Pb perovskites enable efficient all-perovskite tandem solar cells
<p>All-perovskite–based polycrystalline thin-film tandem solar cells have the potential to deliver efficiencies of >30%.

Multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles and superb mechanical behaviors of complex alloys
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong> design based on single–principal-element systems has approached its limit for performance enhancements.

Distinct from the intermetallic-induced embrittlement under conventional wisdom, such MCINP-strengthened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong>s exhibit superior strengths of 1.5 gigapascals and ductility as high as 50% in tension at ambient temperature. The plastic instability, a major concern for high-strength materials, can be completely eliminated by generating a distinctive multistage work-hardening behavior, resulting from pronounced dislocation activities and deformation-induced microbands. This MCINP strategy offers a paradigm to develop next-generation materials for structural applications.</p>

High-affinity adsorption leads to molecularly ordered interfaces on TiO<sub>2</sub> in air and solution
<p>Researchers around the world have observed the formation of molecularly ordered structures of unknown origin on the surface of titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) photocatalysts exposed to air and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion. Using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation of atomic-scale microscopy and spectroscopy, we show that TiO<sub>2</sub> selectively adsorbs atmospheric carboxylic acids that are typically present in parts-per-billion concentrations while effectively repelling other adsorbates, such as alcohols, that are present in much higher concentrations. The high affinity of the surface for carboxylic acids is attributed to their bidentate binding. These self-assembled monolayers have the unusual property of being both hydrophobic and highly water-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e, which may contribute to the self-cleaning properties of TiO<sub>2</sub>. This finding is relevant to TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysis, because the self-assembled carboxylate monolayers block the undercoordinated surface cation sites typically implicated in photocatalysis.</p>

Mixed tailing by TENT4A and TENT4B shields mRNA from rapid deadenylation
<p>RNA tails play integral roles in the regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation and decay. Guanylation of the poly(A) tail was discovered recently, yet the enzymology and function remain obscure. Here we identify TENT4A (PAPD7) and TENT4B (PAPD5) as the enzymes responsible for mRNA guanylation. Purified TENT4 proteins generate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed poly(A) tail with intermittent non-adenosine residues, the most common of which is guanosine. A single guanosine residue is sufficient to impede the deadenylase CCR4-NOT complex, which trims the tail and exposes guanosine at the 3′ end. Consistently, depletion of TENT4A and TENT4B leads to a decrease in mRNA half-life and abundance in cells. Thus, TENT4A and TENT4B produce a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed tail that shields mRNA from rapid deadenylation. Our study unveils the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed tailing and expands the complexity of posttranscriptional gene regulation.</p>

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins
<p>Prion-like RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP43 and FUS are largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e in the nucleus but form solid pathological aggregates when mislocalized to the cytoplasm. What keeps these proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e in the nucleus and promotes aggregation in the cytoplasm is still unknown. We report here that RNA critically regulates the phase behavior of prion-like RBPs. Low RNA/protein ratios promote phase separation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive phase separation and the formation of cytotoxic solid-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.</p>

Five-dimensional imaging of freezing emulsions with solute effects
<p>The interaction of objects with a moving solidification front is a common feature of many industrial and natural processes such as metal processing, the growth of single crystals, the cryopreservation of cells, or the formation of sea ice. Interaction of solidification fronts with objects leads to different outcomes, from total rejection of the objects to their complete engulfment. We imaged the freezing of emulsions in five dimensions (space, time, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e concentration) with confocal microscopy. We showed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e induces long-range interactions that determine the solidification microstructure. The local increase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e concentration enhances premelting, which controls the engulfment of droplets by the front and the evolution of grain boundaries. Freezing emulsions may be a good analog of many solidification systems where objects interact with a solidification interface.</p>

Segregation-induced ordered superstructures at general grain boundaries in a nickel-bismuth alloy
<p>The properties of materials change, sometimes catastrophically, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong>ing elements and impurities accumulate preferentially at grain boundaries. Studies of bicrystals show that regular atomic patterns often arise as a result of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e segregation at high-symmetry boundaries, but it is not known whether superstructures exist at general grain boundaries in polycrystals. In bismuth-doped polycrystalline nickel, we found that ordered, segregation-induced grain boundary superstructures occur at randomly selected general grain boundaries, and that these reconstructions are driven by the orientation of the terminating grain surfaces rather than by lattice matching between grains. This discovery shows that adsorbate-induced superstructures are not limited to special grain boundaries but may exist at a variety of general grain boundaries, and hence they can affect the performance of polycrystalline engineering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong>s.</p>

Direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials
<p>Photolithography is an important manufacturing process that relies on using photoresists, typically polymer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formul</span></strong>ations, that change solubility when illuminated with ultraviolet light. Here, we introduce a general chemical approach for photoresist-free, direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials. The patterned materials can be metals, semiconductors, oxides, magnetic, or rare earth compositions. No organic impurities are present in the patterned layers, which helps achieve good electronic and optical properties. The conductivity, carrier mobility, dielectric, and luminescence properties of optically patterned layers are on par with the properties of state-of-the-art <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion-processed materials. The ability to directly pattern all-inorganic layers by using a light exposure dose comparable with that of organic photoresists provides an alternate route for thin-film device manufacturing.</p>

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion and between grains in materials.</p>

An Iron-Activated Citrate Transporter, MtMATE67, Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume nodules, where it is required for the activity of bacterial nitrogenase, plant leghemoglobin, respiratory oxidases, and other Fe proteins in both organisms. Fe solubility and transport within and between plant tissues is facilitated by organic chelators, such as nicotianamine and citrate. We have characterized a nodule-specific citrate transporter of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family, MtMATE67 of <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. The MtMATE67 gene was induced early during nodule development and expressed primarily in the invasion zone of mature nodules. The MtMATE67 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of nodule cells and also the symbiosome membrane surrounding bacteroids in infected cells. In oocytes, MtMATE67 transported citrate out of cells in an Fe-activated manner. Loss of <i>MtMATE67</i> gene function resulted in accumulation of Fe in the apoplasm of nodule cells and a substantial decrease in symbiotic nitrogen fixation and plant growth. Taken together, the results point to a primary role of MtMATE67 in citrate efflux from nodule cells in response to an Fe signal. This efflux is necessary to ensure Fe(III) solubility and mobility in the apoplasm and uptake into nodule cells. Likewise, MtMATE67-mediated citrate transport into the symbiosome space would increase the solubility and availability of Fe(III) for rhizobial bacteroids.</p>

CELLULASE6 and MANNANASE7 Affect Cell Differentiation and Silique Dehiscence
<p>Cellulases, hemicellulases, and pectinases play important roles in fruit development and maturation. Although mutants with defects in these processes have not been reported for cellulase or hemicellulase genes, the pectinases ARABIDOPSIS DEHISCENCE ZONE POLYGALACTURONASE1 (ADPG1) and ADPG2 were previously shown to be essential for silique dehiscence in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we demonstrate that the cellulase gene <i>CELLULASE6</i> (<i>CEL6</i>) and the hemicellulase gene <i>MANNANASE7</i> (<i>MAN7</i>) function in the development and dehiscence of Arabidopsis siliques. We found that these genes were expressed in both vegetative and reproductive organs and that their expression in the silique partially depended on the INDEHISCENT and ALCATRAZ transcription factors. Cell differentiation was delayed in the dehiscence zone of <i>cel6</i> and <i>man7</i> mutant siliques at early flower development stage 17, and a comparison of the spatio-temporal patterns of <i>CEL6</i> and <i>MAN7</i> expression with the locations of delayed cell differentiation in the <i>cel6</i> and <i>man7</i> mutants revealed that CEL6 and MAN7 likely indirectly affect the timing of cell differentiation in the silique valve at this stage. CEL6 and MAN7 were also found to promote cell degeneration in the separation layer in nearly mature siliques, as cells in this layer remained intact in the <i>cel6</i> and <i>man7</i> mutants and the <i>cel6-1 man7-3</i> double mutant, whereas they degenerated in the wild-type control. Phenotypic studies of single, double, triple, and quadruple mutants revealed that higher-order mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ations of <i>cel6-1</i>, <i>man7-3</i>, and <i>adpg1-1</i> and <i>adpg2-1</i> produced more severe silique indehiscent phenotypes than the corresponding lower-order mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ations, except for some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ations involving <i>cel6-1</i>, <i>man7-3</i>, and <i>adpg2-1</i>. Our results demonstrate that the ability of the silique to dehisce can be manipulated to different degrees by altering the activities of various cell wall-modifying enzymes.</p>

Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (γ) of xylem sap plays a key role in stabilizing air-water interfaces at the pits between water- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low water potentials. We studied seasonal changes in xylem sap γ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine timberline. We analyzed their vulnerability to drought-induced embolism using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions of different γ and estimated the potential effect of seasonal changes in γ on hydraulic vulnerability. In both species, xylem sap γ showed distinct seasonal courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions with low γ caused higher vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism. The water potential at 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was −3.35 and −3.86 MPa at γ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup> but −2.11 and −2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa seasonal variation in 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity. The results revealed pronounced effects of changes in xylem sap γ on the hydraulic safety of trees in situ. These effects also are relevant in vulnerability analyses, where the use of standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions with high γ overestimates hydraulic safety. Thus, γ should be considered carefully in hydraulic studies.</p>

Transcription Factor AREB2 Is Involved in Soluble Sugar Accumulation by Activating Sugar Transporter and Amylase Genes
<p>Sugars play important roles in plant growth and development, crop yield and quality, as well as responses to abiotic stresses. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a multifunctional hormone. However, the exact mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar accumulation is largely unknown in plants. Here, we tested the expression profile of several sugar transporter and amylase genes in response to ABA treatment. <i>MdSUT2</i> and <i>MdAREB2</i> were isolated and genetically transformed into apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) to investigate their roles in ABA-induced sugar accumulation. The MdAREB2 transcription factor was found to bind to the promoters of the sugar transporter and amylase genes and activate their expression. Both MdAREB2 and MdSUT2 transgenic plants produced more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e sugars than controls. Furthermore, MdAREB2 promoted the accumulation of sucrose and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e sugars in an <i>MdSUT2</i>-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the ABA-responsive transcription factor MdAREB2 directly activates the expression of amylase and sugar transporter genes to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e sugar accumulation, suggesting a mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar accumulation in plants.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Bumblebees are not deterred by ecologically relevant concentrations of nectar toxins
<p>Bees visit flowers to collect nectar and pollen that contain nutrients and simultaneously facilitate plant sexual reproduction. Paradoxically, nectar produced to attract pollinators often contains deterrent or toxic plant compounds associated with herbivore defence. The functional significance of these nectar toxins is not fully understood, but they may have a negative impact on pollinator behaviour and health, and, ultimately, plant pollination. This study investigates whether a generalist bumblebee, <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, can detect naturally occurring concentrations of nectar toxins. Using paired-choice experiments, we identified deterrence thresholds for five compounds found in the nectar of bee-pollinated plants: quinine, caffeine, nicotine, amygdalin and grayanotoxin. The deterrence threshold was determined when bumblebees significantly preferred a sucrose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion over a sucrose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion containing the compound. Bumblebees had the lowest deterrence threshold for the alkaloid quinine (0.01 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>); all other compounds had higher deterrence thresholds, above the natural concentration range in floral nectar. Our data, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed with previous work using honeybees, suggest that generalist bee species have poor acuity for the detection of nectar toxins. The fact that bees do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of these compounds likely indicates that it is difficult for them to learn to associate floral traits with the presence of toxins, thus maintaining this trait in plant populations.</p>

Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven).

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The Fluid Lavage in Open Fracture Wounds (FLOW) trial was a multicentre,   blinded, randomized controlled trial that used a 2 × 3 factorial   design to evaluate the effect of irrigation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion (soap <i>versus</i> normal   saline) and irrigation pressure (very low <i>versus</i> low <i>versus</i> high)   on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with open fractures.   In this study, we used this dataset to ascertain whether these factors   affect whether HRQL returns to pre-injury levels at 12-months post-injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Participants completed the Short Form-12 (SF-12) and the EuroQol-5   Dimensions (EQ-5D) at baseline (pre-injury recall), at two and six   weeks, and at three, six, nine and 12-months post-fracture. We calculated   the Physical Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Component Score   (MCS) of the SF-12 and the EQ-5D utility score, conducted an analysis   using a multi-level generalized linear model, and compared differences   between the baseline and 12-month scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found no clinically important differences between irrigating   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions or pressures for the SF-12 PCS, SF-12 MCS and EQ-5D.

Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is a rare form of congenital heart disease. This study describes current surgical treatment strategies and experiences in a cohort of patients from 2 congenital cardiac centers in Shanghai and Guangdong in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This retrospective study included 768 patients operated on between 2005 and 2014. Although most patients (n=690) underwent conventional repair, a sutureless technique was used in 10% (n=78) of cases. A multilevel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed-effects parametric survival model and a competing-risk analysis were used to analyze associated risk factors for death and recurrent pulmonary venous obstruction (PVO), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze the overall survival. The Nelson-Aalen cumulative risk curve was used to compare distributions of time with recurrent PVO.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean surgical age and weight were 214.9±39.2 days and 5.4±3.6 kg, respectively. Obstructed TAPVC (PVO) was documented in 192 (25%) of the 768 patients. There were 38 intraoperative deaths and 13 late deaths. A younger age at the time of repair (<i>P</i>=0.001), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed (<i>P</i>=0.004) and infracardiac (<i>P</i>=0.035) TAPVC, preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.027), prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001), and longer duration of ventilation (<i>P</i>=0.028) were associated with mortality. The median follow-up was 23.2 months (range; 1–112 months). Among the 717 survivors, recurrent PVO was observed in 111 patients (15%). Associated risk factors for recurrent PVO included preoperative PVO (<i>P</i><0.001), infracardiac TAPVC (<i>P</i><0.001), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed TAPVC (<i>P</i>=0.013), and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001). Sutureless technique was associated with a lower restenosis rate compared with conventional repair in patients with preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.038), except in newborn patients (<i>P</i>=0.443). Reintervention for restenosis was performed in 24 patients. The function of most survivors (91%) was classified according to the New York Heart Association as functional class I or II.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Surgical correction in patients with TAPVC with a biventricular anatomy can achieve an acceptable outcome. Risk factors such as a younger age at the time of repair, infracardiac and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed TAPVC, and preoperative PVO were associated with a poorer prognosis.</p></sec>

Mechanical Stress Conditioning and Electrical Stimulation Promote Contractility and Force Maturation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Human Cardiac Tissue
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Tissue engineering enables the generation of functional human cardiac tissue with cells derived in vitro in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation with biocompatible materials. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes provide a cell source for cardiac tissue engineering; however, their immaturity limits their potential applications. Here we sought to study the effect of mechanical conditioning and electric pacing on the maturation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells were used to generate collagen-based bioengineered human cardiac tissue. Engineered tissue constructs were subjected to different mechanical stress and electric pacing conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The engineered human myocardium exhibits Frank-Starling–type force-length relationships. After 2 weeks of static stress conditioning, the engineered myocardium demonstrated increases in contractility (0.63±0.10 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 0.055±0.009 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> for no stress), tensile stiffness, construct alignment, and cell size. Stress conditioning also increased SERCA2 (Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase 2) expression, which correlated with a less negative force-frequency relationship. When electric pacing was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed with static stress conditioning, the tissues showed an additional increase in force production (1.34±0.19 mN/mm<sup>2</sup>), with no change in construct alignment or cell size, suggesting maturation of excitation-contraction coupling. Supporting this notion, we found expression of RYR2 (Ryanodine Receptor 2) and SERCA2 further increased by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed static stress and electric stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These studies demonstrate that electric pacing and mechanical stimulation promote maturation of the structural, mechanical, and force generation properties of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues.</p></sec>

Sugar Potentiation of Fatty Acid and Triacylglycerol Accumulation
<p>Photosynthetically derived sugar provides carbon skeletons for lipid biosynthesis. We used mutants of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and the expression of oleogenic factors to investigate relationships among sugar availability, lipid synthesis, and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in leaf tissue. The <i>adg1</i> mutation disables the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the first step in starch synthesis, and the <i>suc2</i> mutation disables a sucrose/proton symporter that facilitates sucrose loading from leaves into phloem. The <i>adg1suc2</i> double mutant increases glucose plus sucrose content in leaves 80-fold relative to the wild type, total fatty acid (FA) content 1.8-fold to 8.3% dry weight, and TAG more than 10-fold to 1.2% dry weight. The WRINKLED1 transcription factor also accumulates to higher levels in these leaves, and the rate of FA synthesis increases by 58%. Adding <i>tt4</i>, which disables chalcone synthase, had little effect, but adding the <i>tgd1</i> mutation, which disables an importer of lipids into plastids to create <i>adg1suc2tt4tgd1</i>, increased total leaf FA to 13.5% dry weight and TAG to 3.8% dry weight, demonstrating a synergistic effect upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ing these mutations. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ing <i>adg1suc2</i> with the <i>sdp1</i> mutation, deficient in the predominant TAG lipase, had little effect on total FA content but increased the TAG accumulation by 66% to 2% dry weight. Expression of the <i>WRINKLED1</i> transcription factor, along with <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> and the <i>OLEOSIN1</i> oil body-associated protein, in the <i>adg1suc2</i> mutant doubled leaf FA content and increased TAG content to 2.3% dry weight, a level 4.6-fold higher than that resulting from expression of the same factors in the wild type.</p>

An Animal-Like Cryptochrome Controls the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Sexual Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are known as flavin-binding blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects. The animal-like cryptochrome (aCRY) of the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> has extended our view on cryptochromes, because it responds also to other wavelengths of the visible spectrum, including red light. Here, we have investigated if aCRY is involved in the regulation of the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, which is controlled by blue and red light at the steps of gametogenesis along with its restoration and germination. We show that aCRY is differentially expressed not only during the life cycle but also within the cell as part of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e and/or membrane-associated protein fraction. Moreover, localization of aCRY within the algal cell body varies between vegetative cells and the different cell types of gametogenesis. aCRY is significantly (early day) or to a small extent (late night) enriched in the nucleus in vegetative cells. In pregametes, gametes and dark-inactivated gametes, aCRY is localized over the cell body. aCRY plays an important role in the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>: It controls the germination of the alga, under which the zygote undergoes meiosis, in a positive manner, similar to the regulation by the blue light receptors phototropin and plant cryptochrome (pCRY). However, aCRY acts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation with pCRY as a negative regulator for mating ability as well as for mating maintenance, opposite to the function of phototropin in these processes.</p>

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of chloroplast metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In addition, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning chloroplast function is to establish the relationship between these two redox systems and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ing the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has antioxidant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-retarded phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant chloroplast ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the addition of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in chloroplast redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons chloroplasts, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

A Mutation in the bHLH Domain of the SPCH Transcription Factor Uncovers a BR-Dependent Mechanism for Stomatal Development<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The asymmetric cell divisions necessary for stomatal lineage initiation and progression in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) require the function of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor <i>SPEECHLESS</i> (<i>SPCH</i>). Mutants lacking <i>SPCH</i> do not produce stomata or lineages. Here, we isolated a new <i>spch-5</i> allele carrying a point mutation in the bHLH domain that displayed normal growth, but had an extremely low number of sometimes clustered stomata in the leaves, whereas the hypocotyls did not have any stomata. In vivo tracking of leaf epidermal cell divisions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed with marker lines and genetic analysis, showed that the <i>spch-5</i> leaf phenotype is dosage dependent and results from the decreased ability to initiate and amplify lineages, defects in asymmetric cell fate allocation, and misorientation of asymmetric division planes. Notably, application of brassinosteroids (BRs) partly rescued the stomatal leaf phenotype of <i>spch-5</i>. Transcriptomic analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ing <i>spch-5</i> with BR treatments revealed that the expression of a set of SPCH target genes was restored by BRs. Our results also show that BR-dependent stomata formation and expression of some, but not all, SPCH target genes require the integrity of the bHLH domain of SPCH.</p>

Cytosolic and Chloroplastic DHARs Cooperate in Oxidative Stress-Driven Activation of the Salicylic Acid Pathway
<p>The complexity of plant antioxidative systems gives rise to many unresolved questions. One relates to the functional importance of dehydroascorbate reductases (DHARs) in interactions between ascorbate and glutathione. To investigate this issue, we produced a complete set of loss-of-function mutants for the three annotated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) DHARs. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed loss of <i>DHAR1</i> and <i>DHAR3</i> expression decreased extractable activity to very low levels but had little effect on phenotype or ascorbate and glutathione pools in standard conditions. An analysis of the subcellular localization of the DHARs in Arabidopsis lines stably transformed with GFP fusion proteins revealed that DHAR1 and DHAR2 are cytosolic while DHAR3 is chloroplastic, with no evidence for peroxisomal or mitochondrial localizations. When the mutations were introduced into an oxidative stress genetic background (<i>cat2</i>), the <i>dhar1 dhar2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation decreased glutathione oxidation and inhibited <i>cat2</i>-triggered induction of the salicylic acid pathway. These effects were reversed in <i>cat2 dhar1 dhar2 dhar3</i> complemented with any of the three DHARs. The data suggest that (1) DHAR can be decreased to negligible levels without marked effects on ascorbate pools, (2) the cytosolic isoforms are particularly important in coupling intracellular hydrogen peroxide metabolism to glutathione oxidation, and (3) DHAR-dependent glutathione oxidation influences redox-driven salicylic acid accumulation.</p>

Glycerolipid Characterization and Nutrient Deprivation-Associated Changes in the Green Picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i>
<p>The picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i> is a minimal photosynthetic eukaryote that has been used as a model system. <i>O. tauri</i> is known to efficiently produce docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We provide a comprehensive study of the glycerolipidome of <i>O. tauri</i> and validate this species as model for related picoeukaryotes. <i>O. tauri</i> lipids displayed unique features that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed traits from the green and the chromalveolate lineages. The betaine lipid diacylglyceryl-hydroxymethyl-trimethyl-β-alanine and phosphatidyldimethylpropanethiol, both hallmarks of chromalveolates, were identified as presumed extraplastidial lipids. DHA was confined to these lipids, while plastidial lipids of prokaryotic type were characterized by the overwhelming presence of ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs), 18:5 being restricted to galactolipids. C16:4, an FA typical of green microalgae galactolipids, also was a major component of <i>O. tauri</i> extraplastidial lipids, while the 16:4-coenzyme A (CoA) species was not detected. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) displayed the complete panel of FAs, and many species exhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ations of FAs diagnostic for plastidial and extraplastidial lipids. Importantly, under nutrient deprivation, 16:4 and ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated FAs accumulated into de novo synthesized TAGs while DHA-TAG species remained rather stable, indicating an increased contribution of FAs of plastidial origin to TAG synthesis. Nutrient deprivation further severely down-regulated the conversion of 18:3 to 18:4, resulting in obvious inversion of the 18:3/18:4 ratio in plastidial lipids, TAGs, as well as acyl-CoAs. The fine-tuned and dynamic regulation of the 18:3/18:4 ratio suggested an important physiological role of these FAs in photosynthetic membranes. Acyl position in structural and storage lipids together with acyl-CoA analysis further help to determine mechanisms possibly involved in glycerolipid synthesis.</p>

Understanding and Manipulating Meiotic Recombination in Plants
<p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of chromosomes, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is homologous re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation, which promotes homologous pairing and generates crossovers (COs) to connect homologous chromosomes until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding program depends on the ability to bring the desired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ations of alleles on chromosomes. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per chromosome pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of chromosome size. Moreover, their positions are not random on chromosomes but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the generation of novel allelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ations that could be exploited by breeding programs. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify genes that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about gene function. We used a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation of gene-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of genes that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate genes found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated gene models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate genes, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three genes suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ed with reverse mutagenesis technologies to discover and validate genes contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward genetics in identifying the genetic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

The Arabidopsis Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) Components AtBMI1A, B, and C Impact Gene Networks throughout All Stages of Plant Development
<p>Polycomb Group regulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is required to maintain cell differentiation and allow developmental phase transitions. This is achieved by the activity of three PcG repressive complex 2s (PRC2s) and the participation of a yet poorly defined PRC1. Previous results showed that apparent PRC1 components perform discrete roles during plant development, suggesting the existence of PRC1 variants; however, it is not clear in how many processes these components participate. We show that AtBMI1 proteins are required to promote all developmental phase transitions and to control cell proliferation during organ growth and development, expanding their proposed range of action. While AtBMI1 function during germination is closely linked to B3 domain transcription factors VAL1/2 possibly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ation with <i>GT-box</i> binding factors, other AtBMI1 regulatory networks require participation of different factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combin</span></strong>ations. Conversely, EMF1 and LHP1 bind many H3K27me3 positive genes up-regulated in <i>atbmi1a/b/c</i> mutants; however, loss of their function affects expression of a different subset, suggesting that even if EMF1, LHP1, and AtBMI1 exist in a common PRC1 variant, their role in repression depends on the functional context.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 extracted from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of grasses, but its specific binding target is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 binding to sequentially extracted maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily binds glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix polysaccharide in grass CWs. This binding is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 binding, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were observed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially binds GAX. In contrast, no PRE was observed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the rigid fraction of GAX became more rigid upon EXPB1 binding while the dynamic fraction became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens grass CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which binds cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s target in grass CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand binding for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

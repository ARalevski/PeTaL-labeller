<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> mass is generally regarded to be key for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>er, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of very different sizes. The system consists of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s are two-dimensional data from projections, three-dimensional data from volumetric measures, and mass, from which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> density is also calculated. Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rape<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of rape<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>, correlations between the projected area and the mass of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> phenotyping on a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> classification, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> sorting, and assessment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> quality.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> viability is heavily dependent on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat permeability, resulting in lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>’s physiological properties.</p>

A Tonoplast Sugar Transporter Underlies a Sugar Accumulation QTL in Watermelon
<p>How <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transporters regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> accumulation in fruits is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high-concentration Suc. Accumulation of soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s in watermelon (<i>Citrullus lanatus</i>) fruit, a major quality trait, had been selected during domestication. Still, the molecular mechanisms controlling this quantitative trait are unknown. We resequenced 96 recombinant inbred lines, derived from crossing sweet and unsweet accessions, to narrow down the size of a previously described <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> content quantitative trait locus, which contains a putative <i>Tonoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> Transporter</i> gene (<i>ClTST2</i>). Molecular and biochemical analyses indicated that <i>ClTST2</i> encodes a vacuolar membrane protein, whose expression is associated with tonoplast uptake and accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s in watermelon fruit flesh cells. We measured fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> content and resequenced the genomic region surrounding <i>ClTST2</i> in 400 watermelon accessions and associated the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>-related significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Large-scale population analyses strongly suggest increased expression of <i>ClTST2</i> as a major molecular event in watermelon domestication associated with a selection sweep around the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Further molecular analyses explored the binding of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>-induced transcription factor (<i>SUSIWM1</i>) to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>-responsive cis‐element within the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter, which contains the quantitative trait locus (QTL) causal SNP. The functional characterization of <i>ClTST2</i> and its expression regulation by <i>SUSIWM1</i> provide novel tools to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> sink potency in watermelon and possibly in other vegetable and fruit crops.</p>

Repression of CYSTATHIONINE <i>γ</i>-SYNTHASE in Seeds Recruits the <i>S</i>-Methylmethionine Cycle
<p><i>S</i>-Methylmethionine (SMM) was suggested previously to participate in the metabolism of methionine (Met) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. To further reveal its roles, we had previously produced transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RNA interference (RNAi) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s with lower transcript expression of CYSTATHIONINE γ-SYNTHASE (<i>AtCGS</i>), Met’s main regulatory enzyme. Unexpectedly, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s accumulated significantly higher levels of Met compared with control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s through an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, transcript and metabolic analyses coupled with isotope-labeled [<sup>13</sup>C]SMM and [<sup>13</sup>C]Met feeding experiments enabled us to reveal that SMM that was synthesized in rosette leaves of RNAi plants significantly contributed to the accumulation of Met in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s at late stages of development. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-specific repression of <i>AtCGS</i> in RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s triggered the induction of genes operating in the SMM cycle of rosette leaves, leading to elevated transport of SMM toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, where higher reconversion rates of SMM to Met were detected. The metabolic rearrangements in RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s resulted in an altered sulfur-associated metabolism, such as lower amounts of Cys and glutathione, as well as a differential composition of glucosinolates. Together, the data propose a novel cross talk existing between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and rosette leaves along with mutual effects between the Asp family and SMM pathways operating in these tissues. They also shed light on the effects of higher Met levels on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> physiology and behavior.</p>

Transcription Factor AREB2 Is Involved in Soluble Sugar Accumulation by Activating Sugar Transporter and Amylase Genes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s play important roles in plant growth and development, crop yield and quality, as well as responses to abiotic stresses. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a multifunctional hormone. However, the exact mechanism by which ABA regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> accumulation is largely unknown in plants. Here, we tested the expression profile of several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transporter and amylase genes in response to ABA treatment. <i>MdSUT2</i> and <i>MdAREB2</i> were isolated and genetically transformed into apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) to investigate their roles in ABA-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> accumulation. The MdAREB2 transcription factor was found to bind to the promoters of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transporter and amylase genes and activate their expression. Both MdAREB2 and MdSUT2 transgenic plants produced more soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s than controls. Furthermore, MdAREB2 promoted the accumulation of sucrose and soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s in an <i>MdSUT2</i>-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the ABA-responsive transcription factor MdAREB2 directly activates the expression of amylase and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transporter genes to promote soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> accumulation, suggesting a mechanism by which ABA regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> accumulation in plants.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p>Metal accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s is a prerequisite for germination and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate metal transport processes and their interactions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, we focused on METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast transporter of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> stores of Mn, required for efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 transports Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe transport function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe transport. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s in the presence of Mn or subjecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s depends on MTP8 and that this transporter plays an important role in the generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> metal stores as well as for metal homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

A Specialized Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase Contributes to the Extreme Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Content of <i>Cuphea</i> Seed Oil
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oils of many <i>Cuphea</i> sp. contain >90% of medium-chain fatty acids, such as decanoic acid (10:0). These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oils, which are among the most compositionally variant in the plant kingdom, arise from specialized fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes and specialized acyltransferases. These include lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylation of medium-chain fatty acids in the <i>sn</i>-2 and <i>sn</i>-3 positions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identification of a cDNA for a DGAT1-type enzyme, designated CpuDGAT1, from the transcriptome of <i>C. avigera</i> var <i>pulcherrima</i> developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. Microsomes of camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s engineered for CpuDGAT1 expression displayed DGAT activity with 10:0-CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4-fold higher than that in camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> microsomes lacking CpuDGAT1. In addition, coexpression in camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of CpuDGAT1 with a <i>C. viscosissima</i> FatB thioesterase (CvFatB1) that generates 10:0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10:0. More strikingly, expression of CpuDGAT1 and CvFatB1 with the previously described CvLPAT2, a 10:0-CoA-specific <i>Cuphea</i> LPAT, increased 10:0 amounts to 25 mol % in camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> TAG. These TAGs contained up to 40 mol % 10:0 in the <i>sn</i>-2 position, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpression of CvFatB1 and CvLPAT2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10:0 was not detected in phosphatidylcholine in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10:0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these enzymes to generate 10:0-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oils.</p>

Awake1, an ABC-Type Transporter, Reveals an Essential Role for Suberin in the Control of Seed Dormancy
<p>The mother plant plays an important dynamic role in the control of dormancy of her progeny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> in response to environmental signals. In order to further understand the mechanisms by which this dormancy control takes place in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we conducted a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants that fail to enter dormancy in response to variation in temperature during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> set. We show that, for the first of these mutants, designated <i>awake1</i>, the maternal allele is required for entry into strongly dormant states and that <i>awake1</i> mutants show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> phenotypes shown previously to be associated with the loss of suberin in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. We identify <i>awake1</i> as an allele of <i>ABCG20</i>, an ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene required for the transport of fatty acids during suberin deposition, and show that further suberin-deficient mutants have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy defects. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat suberin composition is affected by temperature during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> maturation, but this response appears to be independent of ABCG20. We conclude that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat suberin is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy imposition by low temperature and that the exclusion of oxygen and water from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> by the suberin and tannin layers is important for dormancy imposition.</p>

MYB89 Transcription Factor Represses Seed Oil Accumulation
<p>In many higher plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation is precisely controlled by intricate multilevel regulatory networks, among which transcriptional regulation mainly influences oil biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the master positive transcription factors, <i>WRINKLED1</i> (<i>WRI1</i>) and <i>LEAFY COTYLEDON1-LIKE</i> (<i>L1L</i>), are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation. We found that an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, MYB89, was expressed predominantly in developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s during maturation. Oil and major fatty acid biosynthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s was significantly promoted by <i>myb89-1</i> mutation and <i>MYB89</i> knockdown; thus, MYB89 was an important repressor during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation. RNA sequencing revealed remarkable up-regulation of numerous genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation in <i>myb89</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s at 12 d after pollination. Posttranslational activation of a MYB89-glucocorticoid receptor fusion protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that MYB89 inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation by directly repressing <i>WRI1</i> and five key genes and by indirectly suppressing <i>L1L</i> and 11 key genes involved in oil biosynthesis during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> maturation. These results help us to understand the novel function of MYB89 and provide new insights into the regulatory network of transcriptional factors controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation in Arabidopsis.</p>

ANN1 and ANN2 Function in Post-Phloem Sugar Transport in Root Tips to Affect Primary Root Growth
<p>Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins that play important roles in plant cell signaling. Annexins are multifunctional proteins, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings. Here, we showed that <i>ann-mutant</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings grown in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> show decreased primary root growth and altered columella cells in root caps; however, these mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings grown without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation was found in <i>ann-mutant</i> cotyledons compared to that in wild type, which indicates potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> starvation in the roots of <i>ann-mutant</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings. Unexpectedly, the overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> content of <i>ann-mutant</i> primary roots was significantly higher than that of wild-type roots when grown without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>. To examine the diffusion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> along the entire root to the root tip, we examined the unloading pattern of carboxyfluorescein dye and found that post-phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transport was impaired in <i>ann-mutant</i> root tips compared to that in wild type. Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the root tips of <i>ann-mutant</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings grown without Suc, the latter of which would restrict plasmodesmal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transport to root tips. Our results indicate that ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transport to the root tip, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants.</p>

The Major Origin of Seedless Grapes Is Associated with a Missense Mutation in the MADS-Box Gene <i>VviAGL11</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lessness is greatly prized by consumers of fresh grapes. While stenospermocarpic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> abortion determined by the <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> DEVELOPMENT INHIBITOR</i> (<i>SDI</i>) locus is the usual source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lessness in commercial grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) cultivars, the underlying <i>sdi</i> mutation remains unknown. Here, we undertook an integrative approach to identify the causal mutation. Quantitative genetics and fine-mapping in two ‘Crimson <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>less’-derived F1 mapping populations confirmed the major effect of the <i>SDI</i> locus and delimited the <i>sdi</i> mutation to a 323-kb region on chromosome 18. RNA-sequencing comparing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> traces of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>less and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ed F1 individuals identified processes triggered during <i>sdi</i>-determined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> abortion, including the activation of salicylic acid-dependent autoimmunity. The RNA-sequencing data set was investigated for candidate genes, and while no evidence for causal cis-acting regulatory mutations was detected, deleterious nucleotide changes in coding sequences of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>less haplotype were predicted in two genes within the <i>sdi</i> fine-mapping interval. Targeted resequencing of the two genes in a collection of 124 grapevine cultivars showed that only the point variation causing the arginine-197-to-leucine substitution in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> morphogenesis regulator gene <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE11</i> (<i>VviAGL11</i>) was fully linked with stenospermocarpy. The concurrent postzygotic variation identified for this missense polymorphism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lessness phenotype in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ed somatic variants of the original stenospermocarpic cultivar supports a causal effect. We postulate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> abortion caused by this amino acid substitution in VviAGL11 is the major cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lessness in cultivated grapevine. This information can be exploited to boost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>less grape breeding.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering plants, the female gametophyte controls pollen tube reception immediately before fertilization and regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development immediately after fertilization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for pollen tube reception by the female gametophyte before fertilization and the initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development after fertilization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the female gametophyte and in the zygote and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in pollen or pollen tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double fertilization and supported the model that a passage through the female gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and controls early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of lipid synthesis in oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s is still not fully understood. Oil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of lipid accumulation in oil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> rape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major lipid species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different lipid compositions between the various tissue types within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the lipid composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> lipid accumulation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> maturity. The spatial patterning of lipid molecular species did not vary significantly during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development.

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage formation.</p>

KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering is an agronomically important trait. Two major domestication factors are responsible for this: qSH1 and SH5. Whereas qSH1 functions in cell differentiation in the abscission zone (AZ), a major role of SH5 is the repression of lignin deposition. We have determined that a KNOX protein, OSH15, also controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering. Knockdown mutations of <i>OSH15</i> showed reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-shattering phenotypes. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OSH15 interacts with SH5 and qSH1, two proteins in the BELL homeobox family. In transgenic plants carrying the <i>OSH15</i> promoter-<i>GUS</i> reporter construct, the reporter gene was preferentially expressed in the AZ during young spikelet development. The RNA in situ hybridization experiment also showed that <i>OSH15</i> messenger RNAs were abundant in the AZ during spikelet development. Analyses of <i>osh15 SH5-</i>D double mutants showed that <i>SH5</i> could not increase the degree of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering when <i>OSH15</i> was absent, indicating that SH5 functions together with OSH15. In addition to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-shattering phenotype, <i>osh15</i> mutants displayed dwarfism and accumulated a higher amount of lignin in internodes due to increased expression of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis. Knockout mutations of <i>CAD2</i>, which encodes an enzyme for the last step in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, caused an easy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-shattering phenotype by reducing lignin deposition in the AZ. This indicated that the lignin level is an important determinant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that both OSH15 and SH5 interact directly with <i>CAD2</i> chromatin. We conclude that OSH15 and SH5 form a dimer that enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering by directly inhibiting lignin biosynthesis genes.</p>

Selection for a Zinc-Finger Protein Contributes to Seed Oil Increase during Soybean Domestication
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil is a momentous agronomical trait of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) targeted by domestication in breeding. Although multiple oil-related genes have been uncovered, knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil biosynthesis is currently limited. We demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-preferred gene <i>GmZF351</i>, encoding a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein, is selected during domestication. Further analysis shows that <i>GmZF351</i> facilitates oil accumulation by directly activating <i>WRINKLED1</i>, <i>BIOTIN CARBOXYL CARRIER PROTEIN2</i>, <i>3-KETOACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN SYNTHASE III</i>, <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i>, and <i>OLEOSIN2</i> in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. Overexpression of <i>GmZF351</i> in transgenic soybean also activates lipid biosynthesis genes, thereby accelerating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation. The <i>ZF351</i> haplotype from the cultivated soybean group and the wild soybean (<i>Glycine soja</i>) subgroup III correlates well with high gene expression level, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil contents and promoter activity, suggesting that selection of <i>GmZF351</i> expression leads to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil content in cultivated soybean. Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation, and the manipulation of <i>GmZF351</i> may have great potential in the improvement of oil production in soybean and other related crops.</p>

An acquired distaste: sugar discrimination by the larval parasitoid <i>Microplitis croceipes</i> (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is affected by prior sugar exposure
<p>We examined gustatory responses of the larval parasitoid <i>Microplitis croceipes</i> to determine whether the adults discriminate among common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s, including fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose, found in plants. When given single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> solutions of sucrose, glucose, fructose and maltose at concentrations of 0.008–2.0 mol l<sup>−1</sup>, the estimated concentrations at which 50% of wasps initiated feeding ranged between 0.054 and 0.085 mol l<sup>−1</sup> for sucrose, glucose and fructose, which was significantly lower than for maltose. Wasps showed a strong decrease in feeding time for maltose or fructose following a brief exposure to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s, suggesting that wasps can distinguish maltose and fructose from the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s tested. The higher acceptance threshold and short feeding time in the case of maltose appears adaptive in light of the relatively poor nutritional quality of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> in the longevity trial. The pronounced feeding inhibition seen for fructose following exposure to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s is not linked with lower nutritional performance. This feeding inhibition was even seen in wasps that had fed on glucose at the lowest acceptance threshold (0.031 mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and persisted for 24 h. This study is the first to show feeding inhibition of otherwise phagostimulant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s such as maltose and fructose after gustatory stimulation on other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s.</p>

Two Acyltransferases Contribute Differently to Linolenic Acid Levels in Seed Oil
<p>Acyltransferases are key contributors to triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and, thus, are of great importance for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil quality. The effects of increased or decreased expression of <i>ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>DGAT1</i>) or <i>PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE</i> (<i>PDAT</i>) on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> lipid composition were assessed in several <i>Camelina sativa</i> lines. Furthermore, in vitro assays of acyltransferases in microsomal fractions prepared from developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of some of these lines were performed. Decreased expression of <i>DGAT1</i> led to an increased percentage of 18:3<i>n</i>-3 without any change in total lipid content of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. The tri-18:3 TAG increase occurred predominantly in the cotyledon, as determined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry, whereas species with two 18:3<i>n</i>-3 acyl groups were elevated in both cotyledon and embryonal axis. <i>PDAT</i> overexpression led to a relative increase of 18:2<i>n</i>-6 at the expense of 18:3<i>n</i>-3, also without affecting the total lipid content. Differential distributions of TAG species also were observed in different parts of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. The microsomal assays revealed that <i>C.</i> <i>sativa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s have very high activity of diacylglycerol-phosphatidylcholine interconversion. The combination of analytical and biochemical data suggests that the higher 18:2<i>n</i>-6 content in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil of the <i>PDAT</i> overexpressors is due to the channeling of fatty acids from phosphatidylcholine into TAG before being desaturated to 18:3<i>n</i>-3, caused by the high activity of PDAT in general and by PDAT specificity for 18:2<i>n</i>-6. The higher levels of 18:3<i>n</i>-3 in <i>DGAT1</i>-silencing lines are likely due to the compensatory activity of a TAG-synthesizing enzyme with specificity for this acyl group and more desaturation of acyl groups occurring on phosphatidylcholine.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat, represents an essential sealing component controlling water and solute movement and protecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components controlling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator controlling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

Regulation of sugar transporter activity for antibacterial defense in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Microbial pathogens strategically acquire metabolites from their hosts during infection. Here we show that the host can intervene to prevent such metabolite loss to pathogens. Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transport protein 13 (STP13) is required for antibacterial defense in the plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. STP13 physically associates with the flagellin receptor flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2) and its co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1–associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1). BAK1 phosphorylates STP13 at threonine 485, which enhances its monosaccharide uptake activity to compete with bacteria for extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s. Limiting the availability of extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> deprives bacteria of an energy source and restricts virulence factor delivery. Our results reveal that control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> uptake, managed by regulation of a host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transporter, is a defense strategy deployed against microbial infection. Competition for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> thus shapes host-pathogen interactions.</p>

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oils to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil content and poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks efficient metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced abundant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more abundant than any other fatty acid in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. Efficient utilization of hydroxy-containing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-oil phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage lipid available for mobilization during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to efficiently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified oils in plants.</p>

Sugar Transporter STP7 Specificity for <sc>l</sc>-Arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-Xylose Contrasts with the Typical Hexose Transporters STP8 and STP12
<p>The controlled distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s between assimilate-exporting source tissues and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>-consuming sink tissues is a key element for plant growth and development. Monosaccharide transporters of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> TRANSPORT PROTEIN (STP) family contribute to the uptake of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s into sink cells. Here, we report on the characterization of STP7, STP8, and STP12, three previously uncharacterized members of this family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) revealed that STP8 and STP12 catalyze the high-affinity proton-dependent uptake of glucose and also accept galactose and mannose. STP12 additionally transports xylose. <i>STP8</i> and <i>STP12</i> are highly expressed in reproductive organs, where their protein products might contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> uptake into the pollen tube and the embryo sac. <i>stp8.1</i> and <i>stp12.1</i> T-DNA insertion lines developed normally, which may point toward functional redundancy with other STPs. In contrast to all other STPs, STP7 does not transport hexoses but is specific for the pentoses <sc>l</sc>-arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-xylose. <i>STP7-</i>promoter-reporter gene plants showed an expression of <i>STP7</i> especially in tissues with high cell wall turnover, indicating that STP7 might contribute to the uptake and recycling of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s. Uptake analyses with radioactive <sc>l</sc>-arabinose revealed that 11 other STPs are able to transport <sc>l</sc>-arabinose with high affinity. Hence, functional redundancy might explain the missing-mutant phenotype of two <i>stp7</i> T-DNA insertion lines. Together, these data complete the characterization of the STP family and present the STPs as new <sc>l</sc>-arabinose transporters for potential biotechnological applications.</p>

Spatial Mapping and Profiling of Metabolite Distributions during Germination

Gas chromatography and liquid chromatography analyses demonstrate that the two inbreds are highly differentiated in their metabolite profiles throughout the course of germination, especially with regard to amino acids, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> alcohols, and small organic acids. Crude dissection of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of polar metabolites also revealed that many compounds were highly sequestered among the various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> tissue types. To further localize compounds, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging was utilized to visualize compounds in fine detail in their native environments over the course of germination. Most notably, the fatty acyl chain-dependent differential localization of phospholipids and triacylglycerols was observed within the embryo and radicle, showing correlation with the heterogeneous distribution of fatty acids. Other interesting observations include unusual localization of ceramides on the endosperm/scutellum boundary and subcellular localization of ferulate in the aleurone.</p>

Network-Guided GWAS Improves Identification of Genes Affecting Free Amino Acids
<p>Amino acids are essential for proper growth and development in plants. Amino acids serve as building blocks for proteins but also are important for responses to stress and the biosynthesis of numerous essential compounds. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>, the pool of free amino acids (FAAs) also contributes to alternative energy, desiccation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> vigor; thus, manipulating FAA levels can significantly impact a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>’s nutritional qualities. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on branched-chain amino acids have identified some regulatory genes controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> FAAs, the genetic regulation of FAA levels, composition, and homeostasis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s remains mostly unresolved. Hence, we performed GWAS on 18 FAAs from a 313-ecotype Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) association panel. Specifically, GWAS was performed on 98 traits derived from known amino acid metabolic pathways (approach 1) and then on 92 traits generated from an unbiased correlation-based metabolic network analysis (approach 2), and the results were compared. The latter approach facilitated the discovery of additional novel metabolic interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations not identified by the former approach. The most prominent network-guided GWAS signal was for a histidine (His)-related trait in a region containing two genes: a cationic amino acid transporter (CAT4) and a polynucleotide phosphorylase resistant to inhibition with fosmidomycin. A reverse genetics approach confirmed CAT4 to be responsible for the natural variation of His-related traits across the association panel. Given that His is a semiessential amino acid and a potent metal chelator, CAT4 orthologs could be considered as candidate genes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> quality biofortification in crop plants.</p>

Ecophysiological variables influencing Aleppo pine seed and cone production: a review
<p>The most interesting factors associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> and cone production of Aleppo pine were largely reviewed to identify broad patterns and potential effectiveness of reforestation efforts and planning. Aleppo pine cone production and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yields are relatively variable, with differences between spatial and temporal influences. These differences are considered, mainly between (i) year, (ii) stand characteristics and (iii) individual tree measurements. Annual variability among populations was recorded for cone production per tree, based on influencing factors such as genetic characteristics, wetness, nutrient availability, insect pests and disease. In addition, some factors may affect Aleppo pine tree growth directly but may be affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> and cone production indirectly. Therefore, reduced stand density results in less competition among Aleppo pine trees and accompanying understory flora, which subsequently increases the stem diameter and other tree dimensions, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> production. This review suggests that reforestation planning, particularly thinning, will result in improved tree morphology that will increase Aleppo pine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> and cone crops. Wildfire intensity and stand conditions such as light and soil nutrient status are also examined.</p>

Feedback regulation of COOLAIR expression controls seed dormancy and flowering time
<p>Plants integrate seasonal signals, including temperature and day length, to optimize the timing of developmental transitions. Seasonal sensing requires the activity of two proteins, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), that control certain developmental transitions in plants. During reproductive development, the mother plant uses FLC and FT to modulate progeny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy in response to temperature. We found that for regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy, <i>FLC</i> and <i>FT</i> function in opposite configuration to how those same genes control time to flowering. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy, FT regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy through <i>FLC</i> gene expression and regulates chromatin state by activating antisense <i>FLC</i> transcription.

ABC Transporter-Mediated Transport of Glutathione Conjugates Enhances Seed Yield and Quality in Chickpea
<p>The identification of functionally relevant molecular tags is vital for genomics-assisted crop improvement and enhancement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yield, quality, and productivity in chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). The simultaneous improvement of yield/productivity as well as quality traits often requires pyramiding of multiple genes, which remains a major hurdle given various associated epistatic and pleotropic effects. Unfortunately, no single gene that can improve yield/productivity along with quality and other desirable agromorphological traits is known, hampering the genetic enhancement of chickpea. Using a combinatorial genomics-assisted breeding and functional genomics strategy, this study identified natural alleles and haplotypes of an <i>ABCC3</i>-type transporter gene that regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> weight, an important domestication trait, by transcriptional regulation and modulation of the transport of glutathione conjugates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of <i>desi</i> and <i>kabuli</i> chickpea.

SEIPIN Proteins Mediate Lipid Droplet Biogenesis to Promote Pollen Transmission and Reduce Seed Dormancy
<p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous organelles in plant cells, but their physiological roles are largely unknown. To gain insight into the function of LDs in plants, we have characterized the Arabidopsis homologs of SEIPIN proteins, which are crucial factors for LD biogenesis in yeast and animals. <i>SEIPIN1</i> is expressed almost exclusively in embryos, while <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> have broader expression profiles with maximal levels in embryos and pollen, where LDs accumulate most abundantly. Genetic analysis demonstrates that all three <i>SEIPINs</i> contribute to proper LD biogenesis in embryos, whereas in pollen, only <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> play a significant role. The double <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants accumulate extremely enlarged LDs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and pollen, which hinders their subsequent mobilization during germination. Interestingly, electron microscopy analysis reveals the presence of nuclear LDs attached to type I nucleoplasmic reticulum in triple <i>seipin</i> mutant embryos, supporting that SEIPINs are essential for maintaining the correct polarity of LD budding at the nuclear envelope, restricting it to the outer membrane. In pollen, the perturbations in LD biogenesis and turnover are coupled to reduced germination in vitro and with lower fertilization efficiency in vivo. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, germination per se is not affected in <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants, but there is a striking increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy levels. Our findings reveal the relevance of SEIPIN-dependent LD biogenesis in pollen transmission and in adjusting the timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination, two key adaptive traits of great importance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>e.</p>

To understand whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination relies on the degradation of specific subsets of mRNA, we investigated whether the 5′ to 3′ RNA decay machinery participated in the regulation of this process. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of <i>exoribonuclease4</i> (<i>xrn4</i>) and <i>varicose</i> (<i>vcs</i>) mutants displayed distinct dormancy phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis <i>of xrn4-5</i> and <i>vcs-8</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s allowed us to identify genes that are likely to play a role in the control of germination. Study of 5′ untranslated region features of these transcripts revealed that specific motifs, secondary energy, and GC content could play a role in their degradation by XRN4 and VCS, and Gene Ontology clustering revealed novel actors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy and germination. Several specific transcripts identified as being putative targets of XRN4 and VCS in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s (<i>PECTIN LYASE-LIKE</i>, <i>ASPARTYL PROTEASE</i>, <i>DWD-HYPERSENSITIVE-TO-ABA3</i>, and <i>YELLOW STRIPE-LIKE5</i>) were further studied by reverse genetics, and their functional roles in the germination process were confirmed by mutant analysis. These findings suggest that completion of germination and its regulation by dormancy also depend on the degradation of specific subsets of mRNA.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coats, and their expression requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

The Transcription Factor ATHB5 Affects GA-Mediated Plasticity in Hypocotyl Cell Growth during Seed Germination
<p>Gibberellic acid (GA)-mediated cell expansion initiates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling transition in plants and is repressed by DELLA proteins. Using digital single-cell analysis, we identified a cellular subdomain within the midhypocotyl, whose expansion drives the final step of this developmental transition under optimal conditions. Using network inference, the transcription factor ATHB5 was identified as a genetic factor whose localized expression promotes GA-mediated expansion specifically within these cells. Both this protein and its putative growth-promoting target <i>EXPANSIN3</i> are repressed by DELLA, and coregulated at single-cell resolution during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination. The cellular domains of hormone sensitivity were explored within the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) embryo by putting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s under GA-limiting conditions and quantifying cellular growth responses. The middle and upper hypocotyl have a greater requirement for GA to promote cell expansion than the lower embryo axis. Under these conditions, germination was still completed following enhanced growth within the radicle and lower axis. Under GA-limiting conditions, the <i>athb5</i> mutant did not show a phenotype at the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination, but it did at a cellular level with reduced cell expansion in the hypocotyl relative to the wild type. These data reveal that the spatiotemporal cell expansion events driving this transition are not determinate, and the conditional use of GA-ATHB5-mediated hypocotyl growth under optimal conditions may be used to optionally support rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling growth. This study demonstrates that multiple genetic and spatiotemporal cell expansion mechanisms underlie the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling transition in Arabidopsis.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in plants under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> plants displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type plants; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> plants also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed chlorophyll degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> and no reduction in <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing plants to accumulate biomass and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and plant biomass combined with delayed chlorophyll degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

Archetypal Roles of an Abscisic Acid Receptor in Drought and Sugar Responses in Liverworts
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy and stomatal closure through binding to the intracellular receptor Pyrabactin resistance1 (Pyr1)/Pyr1-like/regulatory components of ABA receptors (PYR/PYL/RCAR) in angiosperms. Genes encoding PYR/PYL/RCAR are thought to have arisen in the ancestor of embryophytes, but the roles of the genes in nonvascular plants have not been determined. In the liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, ABA reduces growth and enhances desiccation tolerance through increasing accumulation of intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s and various transcripts such as those of <i>Late Embryogenesis Abundant</i> (<i>LEA</i>)-like genes. In this study, we analyzed a gene designated Mp<i>PYL1,</i> which is closely related to <i>PYR</i>/<i>PYL</i>/<i>RCAR</i> of angiosperms, in transgenic liverworts. Transgenic lines overexpressing Mp<i>PYL1</i>-<i>GFP</i> showed ABA-hypersensitive growth with enhanced desiccation tolerance, whereas Mp<i>pyl1</i> generated by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing showed ABA-insensitive growth with reduced desiccation tolerance. Transcriptome analysis indicated that Mp<i>PYL1</i> is a major regulator of abiotic stress-associated genes, including all 35 ABA-induced <i>LEA</i>-like genes. Furthermore, these transgenic plants showed altered responses to extracellular Suc, suggesting that ABA and PYR/PYL/RCAR function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> responses. The results presented here reveal an important role of PYR/PYL/RCAR in the ABA response, which was likely acquired in the common ancestor of land plants. The results also indicate the archetypal role of ABA and its receptor in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> response and accumulation processes for vegetative desiccation tolerance in bryophytes.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. The successful production of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development. We show that germinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

The Energy-Signaling Hub SnRK1 Is Important for Sucrose-Induced Hypocotyl Elongation
<p>Emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings respond to environmental conditions such as light and temperature to optimize their establishment. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings grow initially through elongation of the hypocotyl, which is regulated by signaling pathways that integrate environmental information to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development. The hypocotyls of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) also elongate in response to sucrose. Here, we investigated the role of cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>-sensing mechanisms in the elongation of hypocotyls in response to Suc. We focused upon the role of SnRK1, which is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>-signaling hub that regulates metabolism and transcription in response to cellular energy status. We also investigated the role of TPS1, which synthesizes the signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> trehalose-6-P that is proposed to regulate SnRK1 activity. Under light/dark cycles, we found that Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation did not occur in <i>tps1</i> mutants and overexpressors of KIN10 (AKIN10/SnRK1.1), a catalytic subunit of SnRK1. We demonstrate that the magnitude of Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation depends on the day length and light intensity. We identified roles for auxin and gibberellin signaling in Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation under short photoperiods. We found that Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation under light/dark cycles does not involve another proposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> sensor, HEXOKINASE1, or the circadian oscillator. Our study identifies novel roles for KIN10 and TPS1 in mediating a signal that underlies Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation in light/dark cycles.</p>

Regulation of Sucrose Transporters and Phloem Loading in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>Suc transporters (SUTs) play a key role in the allocation and partitioning of photosynthetically fixed carbon in plants. While a function could be assigned to many members of the SUT family, almost no information is available on their regulation. Here, the transcriptional regulation of SUTs in response to various environmental stimuli in the leaves of five dicots (Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>], soybean [<i>Glycine max</i>], potato [<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>], tomato [<i>Solanum</i> <i>lycopersicum</i>], and poplar [<i>Populus</i> spp.]) and four monocots (maize [<i>Zea</i> <i>mays</i>], rice [<i>Oryza sativa</i>], wheat [<i>Triticum aestivum</i>], and barley [<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>]) was investigated. Extensive data on expression of <i>SUT</i>s in relation to changes of environmental conditions were obtained through a global analysis of 168 transcriptomics data sets. Results were validated by quantitative PCR measurements and extended by the measurement of photosynthesis rate and phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> content to draw insight on the correlation of <i>SUT</i> expression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> export from leaves. For the apoplasmic phloem loaders, a clear difference in transcriptional regulation in response to different environmental stimuli was observed. The consistent patterns of <i>SUT</i> expression under abiotic stress indicates which types of SUTs are involved in the regulation of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> status and in stress signaling. Furthermore, it is shown that down-regulation of phloem loading is likely to be caused by transcriptional regulation of SUTs, while up-regulation depends on post-transcriptional regulation. In poplar, expression of <i>PtaSUT4</i> was found to consistently respond to environmental stimuli, suggesting a significant role in the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> export from leaves in this passive symplasmic phloem loader.</p>

Abscisic Acid Modulates Seed Germination via ABA INSENSITIVE5-Mediated PHOSPHATE1

Here, we report that PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1) participates in ABA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination and early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development. The transcription of <i>PHO1</i> was obviously enhanced during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination and early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development and repressed by exogenous ABA. The <i>pho1</i> mutants (<i>pho1-2</i>, <i>pho1-4</i>, and <i>pho1-5</i>) showed ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes, whereas the <i>PHO1</i>-overexpressing lines were ABA-insensitive during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination and early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development. The expression of <i>PHO1</i> was repressed in the <i>ABI5</i>-overexpressing line and elevated in the <i>abi5</i> mutant, and ABI5 can bind to the <i>PHO1</i> promoter in vitro and in vivo, indicating that ABI5 directly down-regulated <i>PHO1</i> expression. Disruption of <i>PHO1</i> abolished the ABA-insensitive germination phenotypes of <i>abi5</i> mutant, demonstrating that <i>PHO1</i> was epistatic to <i>ABI5</i>. Together, these data demonstrate that PHO1 is involved in ABA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination and early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development and transcriptionally regulated by ABI5.</p>

The <i>TRAF Mediated Gametogenesis Progression</i> (<i>TRAMGaP</i>) Gene Is Required for Megaspore Mother Cell Specification and Gametophyte Development
<p>In plants, the role of TRAF-like proteins with meprin and the TRAF homology (MATH) domain is far from clear. In animals, these proteins serve as adapter molecules to mediate signal transduction from Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor to downstream effector molecules. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-sterile mutant with a disrupted TRAF-like gene (<i>At5g26290</i>) exhibiting aberrant gametogenesis led us to investigate the developmental role of this gene in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The mutation was semidominant and resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes with such features as short siliques with fewer ovules, pollen and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> sterility, altered Megaspore Mother Cell (MMC) specification, and delayed programmed cell death in megaspores and the tapetum, features that overlapped those in other well-characterized mutants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> sterility and reduced transmission frequency of the mutant alleles pointed to a dual role, sporophytic and gametophytic, for the gene on the male side. The mutant also showed altered expression of various genes involved in such cellular and developmental pathways as regulation of transcription, biosynthesis and transport of lipids, hormone-mediated signaling, and gametophyte development. The diverse phenotypes of the mutant and the altered expression of key genes related to gametophyte and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development could be explained based on the functional similarly between <i>At5g26290</i> and MATH-BTB domain proteins that modulate gene expression through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome system. These results show a novel link between a TRAF-like gene and reproductive development in plants.</p>

Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its concentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped), thus raising total phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> concentration to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages conferred by both of these symplastic-loading processes. Here, we present an integrated model—including local and global transport and kinetics of polymerization—for passive and active symplastic loading. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to passive loading, polymerization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates export for a given concentration of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> content can be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of active and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

Identification of Homogentisate Dioxygenase as a Target for Vitamin E Biofortification in Oilseeds
<p>Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a major plant source of protein and oil and produces important secondary metabolites beneficial for human health. As a tool for gene function discovery and improvement of this important crop, a mutant population was generated using fast neutron irradiation. Visual screening of mutagenized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s identified a mutant line, designated MO12, which produced brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s as opposed to the yellow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s produced by the unmodified Williams 82 parental cultivar. Using forward genetic methods combined with comparative genome hybridization analysis, we were able to establish that deletion of the <i>GmHGO1</i> gene is the genetic basis of the brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ed phenotype exhibited by the MO12 mutant line. <i>GmHGO1</i> encodes a homogentisate dioxygenase (HGO), which catalyzes the committed enzymatic step in homogentisate catabolism. This report describes to our knowledge the first functional characterization of a plant <i>HGO</i> gene, defects of which are linked to the human genetic disease alkaptonuria. We show that reduced homogentisate catabolism in a soybean <i>HGO</i> mutant is an effective strategy for enhancing the production of lipid-soluble antioxidants such as vitamin E, as well as tolerance to herbicides that target pathways associated with homogentisate metabolism. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of fast neutron mutagenesis in identifying novel genes that contribute to soybean agronomic traits.</p>

Protein Storage Vacuoles Originate from Remodeled Preexisting Vacuoles in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Protein storage vacuoles (PSV) are the main repository of protein in dicotyledonous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, but little is known about the origins of these transient organelles. PSV are hypothesized to either arise de novo or originate from the preexisting embryonic vacuole (EV) during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> maturation.

Confocal and immunoelectron microscopy indicated that both storage proteins and tonoplast proteins typical of PSV were delivered to the preexisting EV in embryos or to the lytic vacuole in reprogrammed leaf cells. In addition, sectioning through embryos at several developmental stages using serial block face scanning electron microscopy revealed the 3D architecture of forming PSV. Our results indicate that the preexisting EV is reprogrammed to become a PSV in Arabidopsis.</p>

Gene Regulation and Survival under Hypoxia Requires Starch Availability and Metabolism
<p>Plants respond to hypoxia, often caused by submergence, by expressing a specific set of genes that contribute to acclimation to this unfavorable environmental condition. Genes induced by low oxygen include those encoding enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism and fermentation, pathways that are required for survival. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> availability is therefore of crucial importance for energy production under hypoxia. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants require starch for surviving submergence as well as for ensuring the rapid induction of genes encoding enzymes required for anaerobic metabolism. The starchless <i>pgm</i> mutant is highly susceptible to submergence and also fails to induce anaerobic genes at the level of the wild type. Treating wild-type plants under conditions inducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> starvation results in a weak induction of alcohol dehydrogenase and other anaerobic genes. Induction of gene expression under hypoxia requires transcription factors belonging to group VII ethylene response factors (ERF-VII) that, together with plant Cys oxidases, act as an oxygen-sensing mechanism. We show that repression of this pathway by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> starvation occurs downstream of the hypoxia-dependent stabilization of ERF-VII proteins and independently of the energy sensor protein kinases SnRK1.1 (SNF1-related kinase 1.1).</p>

Vessel-Specific Reintroduction of CINNAMOYL-COA REDUCTASE1 (CCR1) in Dwarfed <i>ccr1</i> Mutants Restores Vessel and Xylary Fiber Integrity and Increases Biomass
<p>Lignocellulosic biomass is recalcitrant toward deconstruction into simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s due to the presence of lignin. To render lignocellulosic biomass a suitable feedstock for the bio-based economy, plants can be engineered to have decreased amounts of lignin. However, engineered plants with the lowest amounts of lignin exhibit collapsed vessels and yield penalties. Previous efforts were not able to fully overcome this phenotype without settling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> yield upon saccharification. Here, we reintroduced <i>CINNAMOYL-COENZYME A REDUCTASE1</i> (<i>CCR1</i>) expression specifically in the protoxylem and metaxylem vessel cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>ccr1</i> mutants. The resulting <i>ccr1 ProSNBE</i>:<i>CCR1</i> lines had overcome the vascular collapse and had a total stem biomass yield that was increased up to 59% as compared with the wild type. Raman analysis showed that monolignols synthesized in the vessels also contribute to the lignification of neighboring xylary fibers. The cell wall composition and metabolome of <i>ccr1 ProSNBE</i>:<i>CCR1</i> still exhibited many similarities to those of <i>ccr1</i> mutants, regardless of their yield increase. In contrast to a recent report, the yield penalty of <i>ccr1</i> mutants was not caused by ferulic acid accumulation but was (largely) the consequence of collapsed vessels. Finally, <i>ccr1 ProSNBE</i>:<i>CCR1</i> plants had a 4-fold increase in total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> yield when compared with wild-type plants.</p>

The Arabidopsis DNA Methylome Is Stable under Transgenerational Drought Stress
<p>Improving the responsiveness, acclimation, and memory of plants to abiotic stress holds substantive potential for improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>e. An unresolved question is the involvement of chromatin marks in the memory of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>ally relevant stresses. Such potential has spurred numerous investigations yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust stress-induced DNA methylation variation can underpin stress memory. Using a slow-onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we investigated the malleability of the DNA methylome to drought stress within a generation and under repeated drought stress over five successive generations. While drought-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected within a generation, they did not correlate with drought-responsive gene expression. Six traits were analyzed for transgenerational stress memory, and the descendants of drought-stressed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy, and that persisted one generation removed from stress. With respect to transgenerational drought stress, there were negligible conserved differentially methylated regions in drought-exposed lineages compared with unstressed lineages. Instead, the majority of observed variation was tied to stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the experience of repeated drought stress was not observed to influence transgenerational epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that, while transgenerational memory is observed in one of six traits examined, they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to drought stress.</p>

Etiolated Stem Branching Is a Result of Systemic Signaling Associated with Sucrose Level
<p>The potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) tuber is a swollen stem. Sprouts growing from the tuber nodes represent loss of apical dominance and branching. Long cold storage induces loss of tuber apical dominance and results in secondary branching. Here, we show that a similar branching pattern can be induced by short heat treatment of the tubers. Detached sprouts were induced to branch by the heat treatment only when attached to a parenchyma cylinder. Grafting experiments showed that the scion branches only when grafted onto heat- or cold-treated tuber parenchyma, suggesting that the branching signal is transmitted systemically from the bud-base parenchyma to the grafted stem. Exogenous supply of sucrose (Suc), glucose, or fructose solution to detached sprouts induced branching in a dose-responsive manner, and an increase in Suc level was observed in tuber parenchyma upon branching induction, suggesting a role for elevated parenchyma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s in the regulation of branching. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> analysis of the apex and node after grafting showed no distinct differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> levels between branching and nonbranching stems. Vacuolar invertase is a key enzyme in determining the level of Suc and its cleavage products, glucose and fructose, in potato parenchyma. Silencing of the vacuolar invertase-encoding gene led to increased tuber branching in combination with branching-inducing treatments. These results suggest that Suc in the parenchyma induces branching through signaling and not by excess mobilization from the parenchyma to the stem.</p>

The Conserved and Unique Genetic Architecture of Kernel Size and Weight in Maize and Rice
<p>Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a major staple crop. Maize kernel size and weight are important contributors to its yield. Here, we measured kernel length, kernel width, kernel thickness, hundred kernel weight, and kernel test weight in 10 recombinant inbred line populations and dissected their genetic architecture using three statistical models. In total, 729 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, many of which were identified in all three models, including 22 major QTLs that each can explain more than 10% of phenotypic variation. To provide candidate genes for these QTLs, we identified 30 maize genes that are orthologs of 18 rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes reported to affect rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> size or weight. Interestingly, 24 of these 30 genes are located in the identified QTLs or within 1 Mb of the significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We further confirmed the effects of five genes on maize kernel size/weight in an independent association mapping panel with 540 lines by candidate gene association analysis. Lastly, the function of <i>ZmINCW1</i>, a homolog of rice <i>GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING1</i> that affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> size and weight, was characterized in detail. <i>ZmINCW1</i> is close to QTL peaks for kernel size/weight (less than 1 Mb) and contains significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting kernel size/weight in the association panel. Overexpression of this gene can rescue the reduced weight of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homozygous mutant line in the <i>AtcwINV2</i> gene (Arabidopsis ortholog of <i>ZmINCW1</i>). These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development are conserved in maize, rice, and possibly Arabidopsis.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of oxidized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s revealed increased lipid oxidation and hydrolysis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in plants could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most plants, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) plants overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects plant N use efficiency. The modified plants were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered plants allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and produce more biomass and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yields than wild-type plants. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing plants displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s as control plants. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop plants with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

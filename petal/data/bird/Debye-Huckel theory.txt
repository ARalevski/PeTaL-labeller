Experimentally realized mechanochemistry distinct from force-accelerated scission of loaded bonds
<p>Stretching polymer chains accelerates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of a variety of internal covalent bonds, to an extent that correlates well with the force experienced by the scissile bond. Recent theory has also predicted scenarios in which applied force accelerates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of unloaded bonds and kinetically strengthens strained bonds. We report here unambiguous experimental validation of this hypothesis: Detailed kinetic measurements demonstrate that stretching phosphotriesters accelerates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of the unloaded phosphorus-oxygen bond orthogonal to the pulling axis, whereas stretching organosiloxanes inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of the aligned loaded silicon-oxygen bonds. Qualitatively, the outcome is determined by phosphoester elongation and siloxane contraction along the pulling axis in the respective rate-determining transition states. Quantitatively, the results agree with a simple mechanochemical kinetics model.</p>

Holographic description of a quantum black hole on a computer
<p>Black holes have been predicted to radiate particles and eventually evaporate, which has led to the information loss paradox and implies that the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics may be violated. Superstring theory, a consistent theory of quantum gravity, provides a possible solution to the paradox if evaporating black holes can actually be described in terms of standard quantum mechanical systems, as conjectured from the theory. Here, we test this conjecture by calculating the mass of a black hole in the corresponding quantum mechanical system numerically. Our results agree well with the prediction from gravity theory, including the leading quantum gravity correction. Our ability to simulate black holes offers the potential to further explore the yet mysterious nature of quantum gravity through well-established quantum mechanics.</p>

Site-specific reactivity of molecules with surface defects—the case of H<sub>2</sub> dissociation on Pt
<p>The classic system that describes weakly activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation in heterogeneous catalysis has been explained by two dynamical models that are fundamentally at odds. Whereas one model for hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation on platinum(111) invokes a preequilibrium and diffusion toward defects, the other is based on direct and local reaction. We resolve this dispute by quantifying site-specific reactivity using a curved platinum single-crystal surface. Reactivity is step-type dependent and varies linearly with step density. Only the model that relies on localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation is consistent with our results. Our approach provides absolute, site-specific reaction cross sections.</p>

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride ion batteries are potential “next-generation” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operation at high temperatures because suitable fluoride ion–conducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrolyt</span></strong>es are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride ion–conducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrolyt</span></strong>e with high ionic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrolyt</span></strong>e with a copper–lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF<sub>3</sub>) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorination and defluorination reactions in a fluoride ion electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature.

Atomic structure of sensitive battery materials and interfaces revealed by cryo–electron microscopy

Resolving Ambiguity of Species Limits and Concatenation in Multilocus Sequence Data for the Construction of Phylogenetic Supermatrices
<p>Public DNA databases are becoming too large and too complex for manual methods to generate phylogenetic supermatrices from multiple gene sequences. Delineating the terminals based on taxonomic labels is no longer practical because species identifications are frequently incomplete and gene trees are incongruent with Linnaean binomials, which results in uncertainty about how to combine species units among unlinked loci. We developed a procedure that minimizes the problem of forming multilocus species units in a large phylogenetic data set using algorithms from graph theory. An initial step established sequence clusters for each locus that broadly correspond to the species level. These clusters frequently include sequences labeled with various binomials and specimen identifiers that create multiple alternatives for concatenation. To choose among these possibilities, we minimize taxonomic conflict among the species units globally in the data set using a multipartite heuristic algorithm. The procedure was applied to all available GenBank data for Coleoptera (beetles) including > 10 500 taxon labels and > 23 500 sequences of 4 loci, which were grouped into 11 241 clusters or divergent singletons by the BlastClust software. Within each cluster, unidentified sequences could be assigned to a species name through the association with fully identified sequences, resulting in 510 new identifications (13.9% of total unidentified sequences) of which nearly half were “trans-locus” identifications by clustering of sequences at a secondary locus. The limits of DNA-based clusters were inconsistent with the Linnaean binomials for 1518 clusters (13.5%) that contained more than one binomial or split a single binomial among multiple clusters. By applying a scoring scheme for full and partial name matches in pairs of clusters, a maximum weight set of 7366 global species units was produced. Varying the match weights for partial matches had little effect on the number of units, although if partial matches were disallowed, the number increased greatly. Trees from the resulting supermatrices generally produced tree topologies in good agreement with the higher taxonomy of Coleoptera, with fewer terminals compared with trees generated according to standard filtering of sequences using species labels. The study illustrates a strategy for assembling the tree-of-life from an ever more complex primary database.

Blockade of surface-bound TGF-β on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress antitumor immunity by inhibiting the killing of tumor cells by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel cultures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ated B16 melanoma tumors. This system recapitulated the in vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ated tumor cells resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T cells. Immunosuppression was not observed when tumors excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) also prevented immunosuppression. Immunosuppression depended on cell-cell contact or cellular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not inhibit tumor cell killing by T cells. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that tumor-specific Pmel-1 effector T cells physically interacted with tumor-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice. T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from B16 tumors alone were sufficient to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated killing, which depended on surface-bound TGF-β on the T<sub>regs</sub>. Immunosuppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic protein granzyme B and an increase in the cell surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings suggest that contact between T<sub>regs</sub> and antitumor T cells in the tumor microenvironment inhibits antimelanoma immunity in a TGF-β–dependent manner and highlight potential ways to inhibit intratumoral T<sub>regs</sub> therapeutically.</p>

Phosphorylation of the exocyst protein Exo84 by TBK1 promotes insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking
<p>Insulin stimulates glucose uptake through the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. The exocyst complex tethers GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, a process that requires the binding of the G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein) RalA to the exocyst complex. We report that upon activation of RalA, the protein kinase TBK1 phosphorylated the exocyst subunit Exo84. Knockdown of TBK1 blocked insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation; knockout of TBK1 in adipocytes blocked insulin-stimulated glucose uptake; and ectopic overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The phosphorylation of Exo84 by TBK1 reduced its affinity for RalA and enabled its release from the exocyst. Overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 blocked the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of the TBK1/RalA/exocyst complex, and treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with specific inhibitors of TBK1 reduced the rate of complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation. Introduction of phosphorylation-mimicking or nonphosphorylatable mutant forms of Exo84 blocked insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Thus, these data indicate that TBK1 controls GLUT4 vesicle engagement and disengagement from the exocyst, suggesting that exocyst components not only constitute a tethering complex for the GLUT4 vesicle but also act as “gatekeepers” controlling vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane.</p>

Suppressing corrosion in primary aluminum–air batteries via oil displacement
<p>Primary aluminum–air batteries boast high theoretical energy densities, but negative electrode corrosion irreversibly limits their shelf life. Most corrosion mitigation methods are insufficient or compromise power and energy density. We suppressed open-circuit corrosion by displacing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrolyt</span></strong>e from the electrode surface with a nonconducting oil during battery standby. High power and energy density are enabled by displacing the oil with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrolyt</span></strong>e for battery discharge. The underwater-oleophobic wetting properties of the designed cell surfaces allow for reversible oil displacement. We demonstrate this method in an aluminum–air cell that achieves a 420% increase in usable energy density and 99.99% reduction in corrosion, which lowers self-discharge to a rate of 0.02% a month and enables system energy densities of 700 watt-hours per liter and 900 watt-hours per kilogram.</p>

A high-energy-density lithium-oxygen battery based on a reversible four-electron conversion to lithium oxide
<p>Lithium-oxygen (Li-O<sub>2</sub>) batteries have attracted much attention owing to the high theoretical energy density afforded by the two-electron reduction of O<sub>2</sub> to lithium peroxide (Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). We report an inorganic-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrolyt</span></strong>e Li-O<sub>2</sub> cell that cycles at an elevated temperature via highly reversible four-electron redox to form crystalline lithium oxide (Li<sub>2</sub>O). It relies on a bifunctional metal oxide host that catalyzes O–O bond cleavage on discharge, yielding a high capacity of 11 milliampere-hours per square centimeter, and O<sub>2</sub> evolution on charge with very low overpotential. Online mass spectrometry and chemical quantification confirm that oxidation of Li<sub>2</sub>O involves transfer of exactly 4 <i>e</i><sup>–</sup>/O<sub>2</sub>. This work shows that Li-O<sub>2</sub> electrochemistry is not intrinsically limited once problems of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrolyt</span></strong>e, superoxide, and cathode host are overcome and that coulombic efficiency close to 100% can be achieved.</p>

Experimental observation of high thermal conductivity in boron arsenide
<p>Improving the thermal management of small-scale devices requires developing materials with high thermal conductivities. The semiconductor boron arsenide (BAs) is an attractive target because of ab initio calculation indicating that single crystals have an ultrahigh thermal conductivity. We synthesized BAs single crystals without detectable defects and measured a room-temperature thermal conductivity of 1300 watts per meter-kelvin. Our spectroscopy study, in conjunction with atomistic theory, reveals that the distinctive band structure of BAs allows for very long phonon mean free paths and strong high-order anharmonicity through the four-phonon process. The single-crystal BAs has better thermal conductivity than other metals and semiconductors. Our study establishes BAs as a benchmark material for thermal management applications and exemplifies the power of combining experiments and ab initio theory in new materials discovery.</p>

Atmospheric blocking as a traffic jam in the jet stream
<p>Atmospheric blocking due to anomalous, persistent meandering of the jet stream often causes weather extremes in the mid-latitudes. Despite the ubiquity of blocking, the onset mechanism is not well understood. Here we demonstrate a close analogy between blocking and traffic congestion on a highway by using meteorological data and show that blocking and traffic congestion can be described by a common mathematical theory. The theory predicts that the jet stream has a capacity for the flux of wave activity (a measure of meandering), just as the highway has traffic capacity, and when the capacity is exceeded, blocking manifests as congestion. Stationary waves modulate the jet stream’s capacity for transient waves and localize block formation. Climate change likely affects blocking frequency by modifying the jet stream’s proximity to capacity.</p>

Orientation-dependent stereo Wigner time delay and electron localization in a small molecule

This observable provides direct information on the localization of the excited electron wave packet within the molecular potential.

Fish reproductive-energy output increases disproportionately with body size
<p>Body size determines total reproductive-energy output. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">theori</span></strong>es assume reproductive output is a fixed proportion of size, with respect to mass, but formal macroecological tests are lacking. Management based on that assumption risks underestimating the contribution of larger mothers to replenishment, hindering sustainable harvesting. We test this assumption in marine fishes with a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of the intraspecific mass scaling of reproductive-energy output. We show that larger mothers reproduce disproportionately more than smaller mothers in not only fecundity but also total reproductive energy. Our results reset much of the theory on how reproduction scales with size and suggest that larger mothers contribute disproportionately to population replenishment. Global change and overharvesting cause fish sizes to decline; our results provide quantitative estimates of how these declines affect fisheries and ecosystem-level productivity.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">theori</span></strong>es that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Selective formation of γ-lactams via C–H amidation enabled by tailored iridium catalysts
<p>Intramolecular insertion of metal nitrenes into carbon-hydrogen bonds to form γ-lactam rings has traditionally been hindered by competing isocyanate formation. We report the application of theory and mechanism studies to optimize a class of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl iridium(III) catalysts for suppression of this competing pathway. Modulation of the stereoelectronic properties of the auxiliary bidentate ligands to be more electron-donating was suggested by density functional theory calculations to lower the C–H insertion barrier favoring the desired reaction. These catalysts transform a wide range of 1,4,2-dioxazol-5-ones, carbonylnitrene precursors easily accessible from carboxylic acids, into the corresponding γ-lactams via sp<sup>3</sup> and sp<sup>2</sup> C–H amidation with exceptional selectivity. The power of this method was further demonstrated by the successful late-stage functionalization of amino acid derivatives and other bioactive molecules.</p>

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor ductility owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made ductile by specific dilute solute additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued plastic straining during deformation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for ductility as a function of alloy composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium alloys, and the solute-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium. The mechanistic theory can quickly screen for alloy compositions favoring conditions for high ductility and may help in the development of high-formability magnesium alloys.</p>

Coherent band excitations in CePd<sub>3</sub>: A comparison of neutron scattering and ab initio theory
<p>In common with many strongly correlated electron systems, intermediate valence compounds are believed to display a crossover from a high-temperature regime of incoherently fluctuating local moments to a low-temperature regime of coherent hybridized bands. We show that inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of CePd<sub>3</sub> provides a benchmark for ab initio calculations based on dynamical mean field theory. The magnetic response is strongly momentum dependent thanks to the formation of coherent f-electron bands at low temperature, with an amplitude that is strongly enhanced by local particle-hole interactions. The agreement between experiment and theory shows that we have a robust first-principles understanding of the temperature dependence of f-electron coherence.</p>

SAMTOR is an <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway
<p>mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to multiple environmental cues. Nutrients signal via the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) to promote the localization of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. We identified SAMTOR, a previously uncharacterized protein, which inhibits mTORC1 signaling by interacting with GATOR1, the GTPase activating protein (GAP) for RagA/B. We found that the methyl donor <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine (SAM) disrupts the SAMTOR-GATOR1 complex by binding directly to SAMTOR with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation constant of approximately 7 μM. In cells, methionine starvation reduces SAM levels below this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation constant and promotes the association of SAMTOR with GATOR1, thereby inhibiting mTORC1 signaling in a SAMTOR-dependent fashion. Methionine-induced activation of mTORC1 requires the SAM binding capacity of SAMTOR. Thus, SAMTOR is a SAM sensor that links methionine and one-carbon metabolism to mTORC1 signaling.</p>

Estimating the health benefits of environmental regulations
<p>Assessing health benefits of policies addressing environmental contaminants is important for decision-making and for informing the public about how policy affects their welfare (<i>1</i>). Benefits analysis, one side of benefit-cost analysis (BCA), can be relatively straightforward when sufficient data are available on dose-response relationships, changes in exposure expected from a proposed policy, and other key inputs. But despite progress, benefits analysis for health effects is needlessly constrained by analytic practices that are scientifically outdated and inconsistent with economic theory. These limitations can result in exclusion of important health effects from the estimated benefits of reducing exposure to toxic environmental contaminants, which, in turn, affects net benefits calculations that inform public policy. Fortunately, economic theory and scientific advances in the risk assessment literature provide a way forward.</p>

Relativistic deflection of background starlight measures the mass of a nearby white dwarf star

As Stein 2051 B passed closely in front of a background star, the background star’s position was deflected. Measurement of this deflection at multiple epochs allowed us to determine the mass of Stein 2051 B—the sixth-nearest white dwarf to the Sun—as 0.675 ± 0.051 solar masses. This mass determination provides confirmation of the physics of degenerate matter and lends support to white dwarf evolutionary theory.</p>

Motivated by a variety of bioinspired coprecipitation patterns of carbonate and silica, we develop a geometrical theory for the kinetics of the growth front that leaves behind thin-walled complex structures. Our theory explains the range of previously observed experimental patterns and, in addition, predicts unexplored assembly pathways. This allows us to design a number of functional base shapes of optical microstructures, which we synthesize to demonstrate their light-guiding capabilities. Overall, our framework provides a way to understand and control the growth and form of functional precipitating microsculptures.</p>

Why does time seem to fly when we're having fun?
<p>Animals use the neurotransmitter dopamine to encode the relationship between their responses and reward.

Yet, dopamine clearly plays other roles in shaping behavior that have no obvious relationship to reinforcement learning, including modulating the rate at which our subjective sense of time grows in real time. On page 1273 of this issue, Soares <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) closely examine the role of dopamine in mice performing a task in which they keep track of the time between two events and make decisions about this temporal duration. The results suggest the need to reassess the leading theory of dopamine function in timing—the dopamine clock hypothesis (<i>3</i>).

Here we report the synthesis of a molybdenum ammonia complex supported by terpyridine and phosphine ligands that lowers the nitrogen-hydrogen bond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation free energy from 99.5 (gas phase) to an experimentally measured value of 45.8 kilocalories per mole (agreeing closely with a value of 45.1 kilocalories per mole calculated by density functional theory). This bond weakening enables spontaneous dihydrogen evolution upon gentle heating, as well as the hydrogenation of styrene. Analogous molybdenum complexes promote dihydrogen evolution from coordinated water and hydrazine. Electrochemical and theoretical studies elucidate the contributions of metal redox potential and ammonia acidity to this effect.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)

Linking Auxin with Photosynthetic Rate via Leaf Venation
<p>Land plants lose vast quantities of water to the atmosphere during photosynthetic gas exchange. In angiosperms, a complex network of veins irrigates the leaf, and it is widely held that the density and placement of these veins determines maximum leaf hydraulic capacity and thus maximum photosynthetic rate. This theory is largely based on interspecific comparisons and has never been tested using vein mutants to examine the specific impact of leaf vein morphology on plant water relations. Here we characterize mutants at the <i>Crispoid</i> (<i>Crd</i>) locus in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>), which have altered auxin homeostasis and activity in developing leaves, as well as reduced leaf vein density and aberrant placement of free-ending veinlets. This altered vein phenotype in <i>crd</i> mutant plants results in a significant reduction in leaf hydraulic conductance and leaf gas exchange. We find <i>Crispoid</i> to be a member of the <i>YUCCA</i> family of auxin biosynthetic genes. Our results link auxin biosynthesis with maximum photosynthetic rate through leaf venation and substantiate the theory that an increase in the density of leaf veins coupled with their efficient placement can drive increases in leaf photosynthetic capacity.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Degenerative subtalar joints complicated by medial plantar intraneural cysts
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The pathogenesis of intraneural ganglion cysts is controversial.   Recent reports in the literature described medial plantar intraneural   ganglion cysts (mIGC) with articular branches to subtalar joints.

Reactivation of latent working memories with transcranial magnetic stimulation
<p>The ability to hold information in working memory is fundamental for cognition. Contrary to the long-standing view that working memory depends on sustained, elevated activity, we present evidence suggesting that humans can hold information in working memory via “activity-silent” synaptic mechanisms. Using multivariate pattern analyses to decode brain activity patterns, we found that the active representation of an item in working memory drops to baseline when attention shifts away. A targeted pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation produced a brief reemergence of the item in concurrently measured brain activity. This reactivation effect occurred and influenced memory performance only when the item was potentially relevant later in the trial, which suggests that the representation is dynamic and modifiable via cognitive control. The results support a synaptic theory of working memory.</p>

Rogue protein's partners offer hope in Parkinson's disease
<p>It has been 8 years since an astonishing observation persuaded many scientists that the misfolded protein implicated in Parkinson's disease spreads from brain cell to brain cell, like an infection. Last week, findings presented at the huge annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience further buttressed the theory that spread of the rogue protein, called α-synuclein, is responsible for the progressive disease, which is marked by tremor, stiff movements, depression, and, ultimately, dementia. Scientists at the San Diego, California, conference also described their discovery that an obscure protein carried on the cell membranes of neurons and other brain cells blocks the uptake of the α-synuclein into cells. Little is known about TM9SF2, but it is part of a family of proteins that span the cell membrane and indications are that it may work to transport specific molecules from the outside to the inside of the cell. It is made in abundance in the brain, especially in regions where damage to dopamine-producing neurons is known to give rise to Parkinson's. If it emerges that it is indeed a "catcher's mitt" for α-synuclein, it could provide a drug target for a disease whose 10 million sufferers are sorely in need of new medicines. The same goes for another cell membrane protein, LAG-3, which is present in neurons and which was recently described in <i>Science </i>as binding tightly to the rogue Parkinson's protein.</p>

A large fraction of HLA class I ligands are proteasome-generated spliced peptides
<p>The proteasome generates the epitopes presented on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules that elicit CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Reports of proteasome-generated spliced epitopes exist, but they have been regarded as rare events. Here, however, we show that the proteasome-generated spliced peptide pool accounts for one-third of the entire HLA class I immunopeptidome in terms of diversity and one-fourth in terms of abundance. This pool also represents a unique set of antigens, possessing particular and distinguishing features. We validated this observation using a range of complementary experimental and bioinformatics approaches, as well as multiple cell types. The widespread appearance and abundance of proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing events has implications for immunobiology and autoimmunity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">theori</span></strong>es and may provide a previously untapped source of epitopes for use in vaccines and cancer immunotherapy.</p>

How economic, humanitarian, and religious concerns shape European attitudes toward asylum seekers
<p>What types of asylum seekers are Europeans willing to accept? We conducted a conjoint experiment asking 18,000 eligible voters in 15 European countries to evaluate 180,000 profiles of asylum seekers that randomly varied on nine attributes. Asylum seekers who have higher employability, have more consistent asylum testimonies and severe vulnerabilities, and are Christian rather than Muslim received the greatest public support. These results suggest that public preferences over asylum seekers are shaped by sociotropic evaluations of their potential economic contributions, humanitarian concerns about the deservingness of their claims, and anti-Muslim bias. These preferences are similar across respondents of different ages, education levels, incomes, and political ideologies, as well as across the surveyed countries. This public consensus on what types of asylum seekers to accept has important implications for theory and policy.</p>

Multisite phosphorylation by MAPK
<p>Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in signal transduction networks. Phosphorylation alters protein function by regulating enzymatic activity, stability, cellular localization, or binding partners. Over three-quarters of human proteins may be phosphorylated, with many targeted at multiple sites. Such multisite phosphorylation substantially increases the scope for modulating protein function—a protein with <i>n</i> phosphorylation sites has the potential to exist in 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> distinct phosphorylation states, each of which could, in theory, display modified functionality. Proteins can be substrates for several protein kinases, thereby integrating distinct signals to provide a coherent biological response. However, they can also be phosphorylated at multiple sites by a single protein kinase to promote a specific functional output that can be reversed by dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases. On page 233 of this issue, Mylona <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal an unexpected role for multisite phosphorylation, whereby a protein kinase progressively phosphorylates sites on a transcription factor to promote and then subsequently limit its activity independently of dephosphorylation.</p>

Great apes anticipate that other individuals will act according to false beliefs
<p>Humans operate with a “theory of mind” with which they are able to understand that others’ actions are driven not by reality but by beliefs about reality, even when those beliefs are false. Although great apes share with humans many social-cognitive skills, they have repeatedly failed experimental tests of such false-belief understanding. We use an anticipatory looking test (originally developed for human infants) to show that three species of great apes reliably look in anticipation of an agent acting on a location where he falsely believes an object to be, even though the apes themselves know that the object is no longer there. Our results suggest that great apes also operate, at least on an implicit level, with an understanding of false beliefs.</p>

Pathological α-synuclein transmission initiated by binding lymphocyte-activation gene 3
<p>Emerging evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) may be due to cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded preformed fibrils (PFF) of α-synuclein (α-syn). The mechanism by which α-syn PFF spreads from neuron to neuron is not known. Here, we show that LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) binds α-syn PFF with high affinity (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation constant = 77 nanomolar), whereas the α-syn monomer exhibited minimal binding. α-Syn-biotin PFF binding to LAG3 initiated α-syn PFF endocytosis, transmission, and toxicity. Lack of LAG3 substantially delayed α-syn PFF–induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo. The identification of LAG3 as a receptor that binds α-syn PFF provides a target for developing therapeutics designed to slow the progression of PD and related α-synucleinopathies.</p>

An Efficient System for <i>Ds</i> Transposon Tagging in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Transposon tagging is a powerful tool that has been widely applied in several species for insertional mutagenesis in plants. Several efforts have aimed to create transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutant populations in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot plant used as a model system to study temperate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at using transposon strategies. Here, we describe the application of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociation</i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging system in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> element were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> plants. The <i>Ds</i> element was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the function of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, and segregation, the <i>Ds</i> element separated from the <i>Ac</i> element. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only plants using G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> lines, some of which were highly efficient at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only plants. Furthermore, we identified a large collection of mutants with visible developmental phenotypes via this transposon tagging system. The system is relatively simple and rapid in comparison to traditional T-DNA insertion strategies, because once efficiency lines are obtained they can be reused to generate more lines from nontransposed plants without the use of time-consuming tissue culture steps.</p>

Loliolide, a Carotenoid Metabolite, Is a Potential Endogenous Inducer of Herbivore Resistance
<p>Jasmonic acid (JA) plays an important role in the induction of herbivore resistance in many plants. However, JA-independent herbivore resistance has been suggested. An herbivore-resistance-inducing substance was isolated from <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-infected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) leaves in which a hypersensitive response (HR) was induced and identified as loliolide, which has been identified as a β-carotene metabolite. When applied to tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves, loliolide decreased the survival rate of the two-spotted spider mite, <i>Tetranychus urticae</i>, egg deposition by the same pest, and the survival rate of larvae of the common cutworm <i>Spodoptera litura</i> without exhibiting toxicity against these herbivores. Endogenous loliolide levels increased not only with an infestation by <i>S</i>. <i>litura</i> larvae, but also with the exogenous application of their oral secretions in tomato. A microarray analysis identified cell-wall–associated defense genes as loliolide-responsive tomato genes, and exogenous JA application did not induce the expression of these genes. <i>Suppressor of zeaxanthin</i>-<i>less</i> (<i>szl</i>), an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutant with a point mutation in a key gene of the β-carotene metabolic pathway, exhibited the decreased accumulation of endogenous loliolide and increased susceptibility to infestation by the western flower thrip (<i>Frankliniella occidentalis</i>). A pretreatment with loliolide decreased susceptibility to thrips in the JA-insensitive Arabidopsis mutant <i>coronatine</i>-<i>insensitive1</i>. Exogenous loliolide did not restore reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrolyt</span></strong>e leakage in <i>szl</i> in response to a HR-inducing bacterial strain. These results suggest that loliolide functions as an endogenous signal that mediates defense responses to herbivores, possibly independently of JA, at least in tomato and Arabidopsis plants.</p>

Initial Bud Outgrowth Occurs Independent of Auxin Flow from Out of Buds
<p>Apical dominance is the process whereby the shoot tip inhibits the growth of axillary buds along the stem. It has been proposed that the shoot tip, which is the predominant source of the plant hormone auxin, prevents bud outgrowth by suppressing auxin canalization and export from axillary buds into the main stem. In this theory, auxin flow out of axillary buds is a prerequisite for bud outgrowth, and buds are triggered to grow by an enhanced proportional flow of auxin from the buds. A major challenge of directly testing this model is in being able to create a bud- or stem-specific change in auxin transport. Here we evaluate the relationship between specific changes in auxin efflux from axillary buds and bud outgrowth after shoot tip removal (decapitation) in the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>). The auxin transport inhibitor 1-<i>N</i>-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and to a lesser extent, the auxin perception inhibitor <i>p</i>-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB), effectively blocked auxin efflux from axillary buds of intact and decapitated plants without affecting auxin flow in the main stem. Gene expression analyses indicate that NPA and PCIB regulate auxin-inducible, and biosynthesis and transport genes, in axillary buds within 3 h after application. These inhibitors had no effect on initial bud outgrowth after decapitation or cytokinin (benzyladenine; BA) treatment. Inhibitory effects of PCIB and NPA on axillary bud outgrowth only became apparent from 48 h after treatment. These findings demonstrate that the initiation of decapitation- and cytokinin-induced axillary bud outgrowth is independent of auxin canalization and export from the bud.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As water often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant water capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of water across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root water transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of water pathways and root radial hydraulic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">theori</span></strong>es derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of water-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of water flow across roots. The explicit root hydraulic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root water relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root hydraulics.</p>

PROTEIN PHOSHATASE 2A B’<i>α</i> and <i>β</i> Maintain Centromeric Sister Chromatid Cohesion during Meiosis in Arabidopsis
<p>The correct separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, and sister chromatids during meiosis II, relies on the tight control of the cohesion complex. The phosphorylation and subsequent cleavage of the meiotic recombination protein REC8 (REC8-like family protein [SYN1] in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]), the α-kleisin subunit of the cohesion ring, along the chromosome arms at meiosis I allows crossovers and separation of homologous chromosomes without chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation. REC8 continues to localize and function at the centromeres up to metaphase II and, in yeast and vertebrates, is protected from cleavage by means of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation. Here, we show that, in plants, centromeric sister chromatid cohesion until meiosis II also requires the activity of a PP2A-type phosphatase complex. The combined absence of the regulatory subunits PP2AB′α and PP2AB′β leads to the premature loss of chromosome cohesion in meiosis I. Male meiocytes of the <i>pp2ab′αβ</i> double mutant display premature depletion of SYN1. The PP2AA1 structural and B′α regulatory subunit localize specifically to centromeres until metaphase II, supporting a role for the PP2A complex in the SYN1-mediated maintenance of centromeric cohesion in plant meiosis.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms of Photoadaptation of Photosystem I Supercomplex from an Evolutionary Cyanobacterial/Algal Intermediate
<p>The monomeric photosystem I-light-harvesting antenna complex I (PSI-LHCI) supercomplex from the extremophilic red alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i> represents an intermediate evolutionary link between the cyanobacterial PSI reaction center and its green algal/higher plant counterpart. We show that the <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex is characterized by robustness in various extreme conditions. By a combination of biochemical, spectroscopic, mass spectrometry, and electron microscopy/single particle analyses, we dissected three molecular mechanisms underlying the inherent robustness of the <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex: (1) the accumulation of photoprotective zeaxanthin in the LHCI antenna and the PSI reaction center; (2) structural remodeling of the LHCI antenna and adjustment of the effective absorption cross section; and (3) dynamic readjustment of the stoichiometry of the two PSI-LHCI isomers and changes in the oligomeric state of the PSI-LHCI supercomplex, accompanied by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of the PsaK core subunit. We show that the largest low light-treated <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex can bind up to eight Lhcr antenna subunits, which are organized as two rows on the PsaF/PsaJ side of the core complex. Under our experimental conditions, we found no evidence of functional coupling of the phycobilisomes with the PSI-LHCI supercomplex purified from various light conditions, suggesting that the putative association of this antenna with the PSI supercomplex is absent or may be lost during the purification procedure.</p>

Dead or Alive? Using Membrane Failure and Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Fluorescence to Predict Plant Mortality from Drought
<p>Climate models predict widespread increases in both drought intensity and duration in the next decades. Although water deficiency is a significant determinant of plant survival, limited understanding of plant responses to extreme drought impedes forecasts of both forest and crop productivity under increasing aridity. Drought induces a suite of physiological responses; however, we lack an accurate mechanistic description of plant response to lethal drought that would improve predictive understanding of mortality under altered climate conditions. Here, proxies for leaf cellular damage, chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrolyt</span></strong>e leakage were directly associated with failure to recover from drought upon rewatering in <i>Brassica</i> <i>rapa</i> (genotype R500) and thus define the exact timing of drought-induced death. We validated our results using a second genotype (imb211) that differs substantially in life history traits. Our study demonstrates that whereas changes in carbon dynamics and water transport are critical indicators of drought stress, they can be unrelated to visible metrics of mortality, i.e. lack of meristematic activity and regrowth. In contrast, membrane failure at the cellular scale is the most proximate cause of death. This hypothesis was corroborated in two gymnosperms (<i>Picea engelmannii</i> and <i>Pinus contorta</i>) that experienced lethal water stress in the field and in laboratory conditions. We suggest that measurement of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence can be used to operationally define plant death arising from drought, and improved plant characterization can enhance surface model predictions of drought mortality and its consequences to ecosystem services at a global scale.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

Structure of eIF4E in Complex with an eIF4G Peptide Supports a Universal Bipartite Binding Mode for Protein Translation
<p>The association-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of the cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) with eIF4G is a key control step in eukaryotic translation. The paradigm on the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction states that eIF4G binds to the dorsal surface of eIF4E through a single canonical alpha-helical motif, while metazoan eIF4E-binding proteins (m4E-BPs) advantageously compete against eIF4G via bimodal interactions involving this canonical motif and a second noncanonical motif of the eIF4E surface. Metazoan eIF4Gs share this extended binding interface with m4E-BPs, with significant implications on the understanding of translation regulation and the design of therapeutic molecules. Here we show the high-resolution structure of melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) eIF4E in complex with a melon eIF4G peptide and propose the first eIF4E-eIF4G structural model for plants. Our structural data together with functional analyses demonstrate that plant eIF4G binds to eIF4E through both the canonical and noncanonical motifs, similarly to metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G complexes. As in the case of metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G, this may have very important practical implications, as plant eIF4E-eIF4G is also involved in a significant number of plant diseases. In light of our results, a universal eukaryotic bipartite mode of binding to eIF4E is proposed.</p>

More tornadoes in the most extreme U.S. tornado outbreaks
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tornado</span></strong>es and severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thunderstorm</span></strong>s kill people and damage property every year. Estimated U.S. insured losses due to severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thunderstorm</span></strong>s in the first half of 2016 were $8.5 billion (US). The largest U.S. effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tornado</span></strong>es result from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tornado</span></strong> outbreaks, which are sequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tornado</span></strong>es that occur in close succession. Here, using extreme value analysis, we find that the frequency of U.S. outbreaks with many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tornado</span></strong>es is increasing and that it is increasing faster for more extreme outbreaks. We model this behavior by extreme value distributions with parameters that are linear functions of time or of some indicators of multidecadal climatic variability. Extreme meteorological environments associated with severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thunderstorm</span></strong>s show consistent upward trends, but the trends do not resemble those currently expected to result from global warming.</p>

East Asian hydroclimate modulated by the position of the westerlies during Termination I
<p>Speleothem oxygen isotope records have revolutionized our understanding of the paleo East Asian monsoon, yet there is fundamental disagreement on what they represent in terms of the hydroclimate changes. We report a multiproxy speleothem record of monsoon evolution during the last deglaciation from the middle Yangtze region, which indicates a wetter central eastern China during North Atlantic cooling episodes, despite the oxygen isotopic record suggesting a weaker monsoon. We show that this apparent contradiction can be resolved if the changes are interpreted as a lengthening of the Meiyu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rain</span></strong>s and shortened post-Meiyu stage, in accordance with a recent hypothesis. Model simulations support this interpretation and further reveal the role of the westerlies in communicating the North Atlantic influence to the East Asian climate.</p>

Disease sleuths unmask deadly encephalitis culprit
<p>Soon after the monsoon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rain</span></strong>s arrive in June, the northern city of Gorakhpur transforms into the "encephalitis capital of India." Hundreds of children from across the surrounding Uttar Pradesh state arrive at Baba Raghav Das Medical College with the b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rain</span></strong> inflammation that causes delirium, seizures, and—in about 20% of those patients—death. For decades, the recurring spates of cases and high mortality rate stumped experts. Now, medical detectives think they have solved the mystery: A major cause of the seasonal encephalitis outbreaks is scrub typhus, a bacterial malady transmitted by a microscopic mite. The culprit was first unmasked 3 years ago—but most researchers didn't believe it then. The new evidence, described this month in <i>Emerging Infectious Diseases</i>, indicates the responsible bacterium is far more dangerous than realized.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Regulation of Stomatal Defense by Air Relative Humidity
<p>It has long been observed that environmental conditions play crucial roles in modulating immunity and disease in plants and animals. For instance, many bacterial plant disease outbreaks occur after periods of high humidity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rain</span></strong>. A critical step in bacterial infection is entry into the plant interior through wounds and natural openings, such as stomata, which are adjustable microscopic pores in the epidermal tissue. Several studies have shown that stomatal closure is an integral part of the plant immune response to reduce pathogen invasion. In this study, we found that high humidity can effectively compromise <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>-triggered stomatal closure in both <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), which is accompanied by early up-regulation of the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway and simultaneous down-regulation of salicylic acid (SA) pathway in guard cells. Furthermore, SA-dependent response, but not JA-dependent response, is faster in guard cells than in whole leaves, suggesting that the SA signaling in guard cells may be independent from other cell types. Thus, we conclude that high humidity, a well-known disease-promoting environmental condition, acts in part by suppressing stomatal defense and is linked to hormone signaling in guard cells.</p>

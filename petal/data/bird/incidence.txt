Factors affecting the potential for posterior bony impingement after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to evaluate the radiographic characteristics of patients   undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) for the potential of posterior   bony <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement using CT simulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Virtual CT data from 112 patients who underwent THA were analysed.   There were 40 men and 72 women. Their mean age was 59.1 years (41   to 76). Associations between radiographic characteristics and posterior   bony <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement and the range of external rotation of the hip were   evaluated. In addition, we investigated the effects of pelvic tilt   and the neck/shaft angle and femoral offset on posterior bony <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The range of external rotation and the ischiofemoral length were   significantly lower, while femoral anteversion, the ischial ratio,   and ischial angle were significantly higher in patients with posterior   bony <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement compared with those who had implant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement   (p < 0.05). The range of external rotation positively correlated   with ischiofemoral length (r = 0.49, p < 0.05), and negatively   correlated with ischial length (r = -0.49, p < 0.05), ischial   ratio (r =- 0.49, p < 0.05) and ischial angle (r = -0.55, p <   0.05). The range of external rotation was lower in patients with posterior   pelvic tilt (p < 0.05) and in those with a high offset femoral   component (p < 0.05) due to posterior bony <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Posterior bony <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement after THA is more likely in patients   with a wider ischium and a narrow ischiofemoral space.

Three-dimensional morphology and bony range of movement in hip joints in patients with hip dysplasia
<p>To confirm whether developmental dysplasia of   the hip has a risk of hip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement, we analysed maximum ranges   of movement to the point of bony <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement location   using three-dimensional (3D) surface models of the pelvis and femur   in combination with 3D morphology of the hip joint using computer-assisted methods.   Results of computed tomography were examined for 52 hip joints with   DDH and 73 normal healthy hip joints. DDH shows larger maximum extension   (p = 0.001) and internal rotation at 90° flexion (p < 0.001).   Similar maximum flexion (p = 0.835) and external rotation (p = 0.713)   were observed between groups, while high rates of extra-articular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement were noticed in these directions in DDH (p < 0.001).   Smaller cranial acetabular anteversion (p = 0.048), centre-edge   angles (p < 0.001), a circumferentially shallower acetabulum,   larger femoral neck anteversion (p < 0.001), and larger alpha   angle were identified in DDH. Risk of anterior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement in retroverted   DDH hips is similar to that in retroverted normal hips in excessive   adduction but minimal in less adduction. These findings might be   borne in mind when considering the possibility of extra-articular   posterior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement in DDH being a source of pain, particularly   for patients with a highly anteverted femoral neck.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:580–9.</p>

Spinopelvic mobility and acetabular component position for total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Posterior tilt of the pelvis with sitting provides biological   acetabular opening. Our goal was to study the post-operative interaction   of skeletal mobility and sagittal acetabular component position.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a radiographic study of 160 hips (151 patients) who   prospectively had lateral spinopelvic hip radiographs for skeletal   and implant measurements. Intra-operative acetabular component position   was determined according to the pre-operative spinal mobility. Sagittal   implant measurements of ante-inclination and sacral acetabular angle were   used as surrogate measurements for the risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement, and   intra-operative acetabular component angles were compared with these.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Post-operatively, ante-inclination and sacral acetabular angles   were within normal range in 133 hips (83.1%).

Jak-TGFβ cross-talk links transient adipose tissue inflammation to beige adipogenesis
<p>The transient activation of inflammatory networks is required for adipose tissue remodeling including the “browning” of white fat in response to stimuli such as β3-adrenergic receptor activation. In this process, white adipose tissue acquires thermogenic characteristics through the recruitment of so-called beige adipocytes. We investigated the downstream signaling pathways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ing on adipocyte progenitors that promote de novo formation of adipocytes. We showed that the Jak family of kinases controlled TGFβ signaling in the adipose tissue microenvironment through Stat3 and thereby adipogenic commitment, a function that was required for beige adipocyte differentiation of murine and human progenitors. Jak/Stat3 inhibited TGFβ signaling to the transcription factors Srf and Smad3 by repressing local <i>Tgfb3</i> and <i>Tgfb1</i> expression before the core transcriptional adipogenic cascade was activated. This pathway cross-talk was triggered in stromal cells by ATGL-dependent adipocyte lipolysis and a transient wave of IL-6 family cytokines at the onset of adipose tissue remodeling induced by β3-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Our results provide insight into the activation of adipocyte progenitors and are relevant for the therapeutic targeting of adipose tissue inflammatory pathways.</p>

A femtomolar-range suicide germination stimulant for the parasitic plant <i>Striga hermonthica</i>
<p>The parasitic plant <i>Striga hermonthica</i> has been causing devastating damage to the crop production in Africa. Because <i>Striga</i> requires host-generated strigolactones to germinate, the identification of selective and potent strigolactone agonists could help control these noxious weeds. We developed a selective agonist, sphynolactone-7, a hybrid molecule originated from chemical screening, that contains two functional modules derived from a synthetic scaffold and a core component of strigolactones. Cooperative action of these modules in the activation of a high-affinity strigolactone receptor ShHTL7 allows sphynolactone-7 to provoke <i>Striga</i> germination with potency in the femtomolar range. We demonstrate that sphynolactone-7 is effective for reducing <i>Striga</i> parasitism without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ing on host strigolactone-related processes.</p>

Capping Protein Modulates Actin Remodeling in Response to Reactive Oxygen Species during Plant Innate Immunity
<p>Plants perceive microbe-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns to activate innate immune signaling events, such as bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The actin cytoskeleton remodels during the first 5 min of innate immune signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) epidermal cells; however, the immune signals that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>e on actin cytoskeleton and its response regulators remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that rapid actin remodeling upon elicitation with diverse microbe-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns represent a conserved plant immune response. Actin remodeling requires ROS generated by the defense-associated NADPH oxidase, RBOHD. Moreover, perception of flg22 by its cognate receptor complex triggers actin remodeling through the activation of RBOHD-dependent ROS production. Our genetic studies reveal that the ubiquitous heterodimeric capping protein transduces ROS signaling to the actin cytoskeleton during innate immunity. Additionally, we uncover a negative feedback loop between actin remodeling and flg22-induced ROS production.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
An NADPH-Oxidase/Polyamine Oxidase Feedback Loop Controls Oxidative Burst Under Salinity
<p>The apoplastic polyamine oxidase (PAO) catalyzes the oxidation of the higher polyamines spermidine and spermine, contributing to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) accumulation. However, it is yet unclear whether apoplastic PAO is part of a network that coordinates the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under salinity or if it acts independently. Here, we unravel that NADPH oxidase and apoplastic PAO cooperate to control the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxides (O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>) in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). To examine to what extent apoplastic PAO constitutes part of a ROS-generating network, we examined ROS accumulation in guard cells of plants overexpressing or down-regulating apoplastic PAO (lines S2.2 and A2, respectively) or down-regulating NADPH oxidase (line AS-<i>NtRbohD</i>/<i>F</i>). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed that, under salinity, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased in S2.2 and decreased in A2 compared with the wild type. Surprisingly, the O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-So showed that O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> levels correlated positively with that of apoplastic PAO (i.e. showed high and low levels in S2.2 and A2, respectively). By using AS-<i>NtRbohD/F</i> lines and a pharmacological approach, we could show that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> accumulation at the onset of salinity stress was dependent on NADPH oxidase, indicating that NADPH oxidase is upstream of apoplastic PAO. Our results suggest that NADPH oxidase and the apoplastic PAO form a feed-forward ROS amplification loop, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>es on oxidative state and culminates in the execution of programmed cell death. We propose that the PAO/NADPH oxidase loop is a central hub in the plethora of responses controlling salt stress tolerance, with potential functions extending beyond stress tolerance.</p>

Dislocation of a primary total hip arthroplasty is more common in patients with a lumbar spinal fusion
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Lumbar fusion is known to reduce the variation in pelvic tilt   between standing and sitting. A flexible lumbo-pelvic unit increases   the stability of total hip arthroplasty (THA) when seated by increasing   anterior clearance and acetabular anteversion, thereby preventing   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement of the prosthesis. Lumbar fusion may eliminate this protective   pelvic movement. The effect of lumbar fusion on the stability of   total hip arthroplasty has not previously been investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The Medicare database was searched for patients who had undergone   THA and spinal fusion between 2005 and 2012. PearlDiver software   was used to query the database by the International Classification   of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedural   code for primary THA and lumbar spinal fusion. Patients who had   undergone both lumbar fusion and THA were then divided into three   groups: 1 to 2 levels, 3 to 7 levels and 8+ levels of fusion. The   rate of dislocation in each group was established using ICD-9-CM codes.   Patients who underwent THA without spinal fusion were used as a   control group. Statistical significant difference between groups   was tested using the chi-squared test, and significance set at p   < 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At one-year follow-up, 14 747 patients were found to have had   a THA after lumbar spinal fusion (12 079 1 to 2 levels, 2594 3 to   7 levels, 74 8+ levels). The control group consisted of 839 004   patients. The dislocation rate in the control group was 1.55%. A   higher rate of dislocation was found in patients with a spinal fusion   of 1 to 2 levels (2.96%, p < 0.0001) and 3 to 7 levels (4.12%,   p < 0.0001). Patients with 3 to 7 levels of fusion had a higher   rate of dislocation than patients with 1 to 2 levels of fusion (odds   ratio (OR) = 1.60, p < 0.0001). When groups were matched for   age and gender to the unfused cohort, patients with 1 to 2 levels   of fusion had an OR of 1.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to   2.32, p < 0.001), and those with 3 to 7 levels of fusion an OR   of 2.77 (CI 2.04 to 4.80, p < 0.001) for dislocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with a previous history of lumbar spinal fusion have   a significantly higher rate of dislocation of their THA than age-   and gender-matched patients without a lumbar spinal fusion.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:585–91.</p></sec>

Decreased and increased relative acetabular volume predict the development of osteoarthritis of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Recently, there has been considerable interest in quantifying   the associations between bony abnormalities around and in the hip   joint and osteoarthritis (OA). Our aim was to investigate the relationships   between acetabular undercoverage, acetabular overcoverage, and femoroacetabular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement (FAI) with OA of the hip, which currently remain controversial. </p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 545 cadaveric skeletons (1090 hips) from the Hamann-Todd   osteological collection were obtained. Femoral head volume (FHV),   acetabular volume (AV), the FHV/AV ratio, acetabular version, alpha   angle and anterior femoral neck offset (AFNO) were measured. A validated   grading system was used to quantify OA of the hip as minimal, moderate,   or severe. Multiple linear and multinomial logistic regression were   used to determine the factors that correlated independently with   the FHV, AV, and the FHV/AV ratio. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Female cadavers had smaller FHVs (standardised beta -0.382, p   < 0.001), and AVs (standardised beta -0.351, p < 0.001), compared   with male patients, although the FHV/AV ratio was unchanged. Every   1° increase in alpha angle increased the probability of having moderate   OA of the hip compared with minimal OA by 7.1%. Every 1 mm decrease   in AFNO increased the probability of having severe or moderate OA   of the hip, compared with minimal OA, by 11% and 9%, respectively.   The relative risk ratios of having severe OA of the hip compared   with minimal OA were 7.2 and 3.3 times greater for acetabular undercoverage   and overcoverage, respectively, relative to normal acetabular cover. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Acetabular undercoverage and overcoverage were independent predictors   of increased OA of the hip.

Complications following arthroscopic surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery of the   hip has increased significantly during the past decade. It has now   become an established technique for the treatment of many intra-   and extra-articular conditions affecting the hip. However, it has   a steep learning curve and is not without the risk of complications.   The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence   of complications during and following this procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines were used in designing this study. Two reviewers systematically   searched the literature for complications related to arthroscopy   of the hip. The research question and eligibility criteria were   established <i>a priori</i>. Pertinent data were abstracted   and analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found 276 relevant studies with a total of 36 761 arthroscopies   that met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was   36.7 years (1.7 to 70) and the mean body mass index was 25.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (20.2   to 29.2). Femoroacetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>ement and labral tears were the   most common indications for the procedure. The total number of complications   was 1222 (3.3%). Nerve injury (0.9%), mainly involving the pudendal   and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves, and iatrogenic chondral and   labral injury (0.7%), were the two most common complications.

Development
The <i>Drosophila</i> MAST kinase Drop out is required to initiate membrane compartmentalisation during cellularisation and regulates dynein-based transport
<p>Cellularisation of the <i>Drosophila</i> syncytial blastoderm embryo into the polarised blastoderm epithelium provides an excellent model with which to determine how cortical plasma membrane asymmetry is generated during development. Many components of the molecular machinery driving cellularisation have been identified, but cell signalling events acting at the onset of membrane asymmetry are poorly understood. Here we show that mutations in <i>drop out</i> (<i>dop</i>) disturb the segregation of membrane cortical compartments and the clustering of E-cadherin into basal adherens junctions in early cellularisation. <i>dop</i> is required for normal furrow formation and controls the tight localisation of furrow canal proteins and the formation of F-actin foci at the incipient furrows. We show that <i>dop</i> encodes the single <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of microtubule-associated Ser/Thr (MAST) kinases. <i>dop</i> interacts genetically with components of the dynein/dynactin complex and promotes dynein-dependent transport in the embryo. Loss of <i>dop</i> function reduces phosphorylation of Dynein intermediate chain, suggesting that <i>dop</i> is involved in regulating cytoplasmic dynein activity through direct or indirect mechanisms. These data suggest that Dop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imping</span></strong>es upon the initiation of furrow formation through developmental regulation of cytoplasmic dynein.</p>

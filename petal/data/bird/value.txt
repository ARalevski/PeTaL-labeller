Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation. The novel method of LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical cut points. For low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation performs better in nonfasting samples than the fixed Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides.

The Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Patients at Risk of Infective Endocarditis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended stopping antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for those at risk of infective endocarditis (IE) undergoing dental procedures in the United Kingdom, citing a lack of evidence of efficacy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness. We have performed a new economic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of AP on the basis of contemporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of efficacy, adverse events, and resource implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A decision analytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness model was used.

Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>AP was less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>ly and more effective than no AP for all patients at risk of IE. The results are sensitive to AP efficacy, but efficacy would have to be substantially lower for AP not to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective. AP was even more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective in patients at high risk of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk and 33 cases in all at-risk patients) would be required for AP to be considered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> savings of £5.5 to £8.2 million ($7.3–$10.9 million) and health gains >2600 quality-adjusted life-years could be achieved from reinstating AP in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>AP is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective for preventing IE, particularly in those at high risk.

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine samples on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine sample between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection during a 17-year follow-up. Sodium intake was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated with a single baseline collection and the average of samples collected during a 1-, 5-, and 15-year follow-up. We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine samples. Average age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. Average 24-hour sodium excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88). However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year average was used, respectively.

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the risk of bleeding. Although empirical models have been developed to predict such risks, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011. Empirical stroke and bleeding risks were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed by using the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS<sub>2</sub>) and Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) scores, respectively. Separately, physicians were asked to categorize their patients’ stroke and bleeding risks: low risk (<3%); intermediate risk (3%–6%); and high risk (>6%). Overall, 72% (n=7251) in ORBIT-AF had high-risk CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores (≥2). However, only 16% were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed as high stroke risk by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding risk (score ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians. The associations between empirical and physician-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated stroke and bleeding risks were low (weighted Kappa 0.1 and 0.11, respectively). Physicians weighed hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus less significantly than empirical models in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ating stroke risk; physicians weighted anemia and dialysis less significantly than empirical models when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ating bleeding risks.

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statins are effective in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline expands recommended statin use, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness has not been compared with other guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness of the ACC/AHA guideline relative to current use, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and universal statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age over a 10-year horizon from 2016 to 2025. Sensitivity analyses varied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness ratios and numbers needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than women. Results vary moderately with different risk thresholds for instituting statins and statin toxicity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates but depend greatly on the disutility caused by daily medication use (pill burden).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>At a population level, the ACC/AHA guideline for expanded statin use for primary prevention is projected to treat more people, to save more lives, and to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> less compared with Adult Treatment Panel III in both men and women. Whether individuals benefit from long-term statin use for primary prevention depends more on the disutility associated with pill burden than their degree of cardiovascular risk.</p></sec>

Development and Evolution of a Hierarchical Clinical Composite End Point for the Evaluation of Drugs and Devices for Acute and Chronic Heart Failure
<p>Traditional approaches to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment of new treatments for heart failure have generally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated individual components of the syndrome at fixed points in time or have relied on surrogate physiological measures that are poorly correlated with the clinical status of patients. Conventional time-to-event trials that focus on morbidity and mortality represent an important methodological advance, but they generally assign undue weight to clinical events of less importance and are insensitive to difference in functional capacity among individuals who do not experience a clinical event during follow-up. Twenty years ago, a hierarchical clinical composite was developed to address these limitations; it aims to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> the clinical course of patients as a physician would in practice by combining a symptomatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment of the patient at each visit with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of the clinical stability of the patient between visits. The composite does not generate a numeric score by summing arbitrarily assigned weights to certain symptoms or events; instead, the composite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rank</span></strong>s relevant measures and outcomes according to clinical priority. In doing so, the clinical composite minimizes the biases created by noncompleting patients in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment of symptoms or exercise tolerance while expanding the range of patients who contribute to the treatment difference in a typical morbidity and mortality trial. When applied appropriately, the hierarchical clinical composite end point has reliably distinguished effective from ineffective treatments. The composite may have particular advantages in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of new devices and transcatheter interventions in chronic heart failure and of new drugs for acute heart failure. Recent modifications enhance its discriminant characteristics and its ability to accurately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> the efficacy of novel interventions for heart failure.</p>

The extent of forest in dryland biomes
<p>Dryland biomes cover two-fifths of Earth’s land surface, but their forest area is poorly known. Here, we report an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate of global forest extent in dryland biomes, based on analyzing more than 210,000 0.5-hectare sample plots through a photo-interpretation approach using large databases of satellite imagery at (i) very high spatial resolution and (ii) very high temporal resolution, which are available through the Google Earth platform. We show that in 2015, 1327 million hectares of drylands had more than 10% tree-cover, and 1079 million hectares comprised forest. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate is 40 to 47% higher than previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates, corresponding to 467 million hectares of forest that have never been reported before. This increases current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of global forest cover by at least 9%.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated for their accuracy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-based Plant Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to observe an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental population genetic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding mutations including common mutations outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. Mutations were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of mutation and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid mutations confer resistance providing a large mutational target—we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population mutation parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated.</p>

Systematic Biology
Diversity, Disparity, and Evolutionary Rate Estimation for Unresolved Yule Trees
<p>The branching structure of biological evolution confers statistical dependencies on phenotypic trait values in related organisms. For this reason, comparative macroevolutionary studies usually begin with an inferred phylogeny that describes the evolutionary relationships of the organisms of interest. The probability of the observed trait data can be computed by assuming a model for trait evolution, such as Brownian motion, over the branches of this fixed tree. However, the phylogenetic tree itself contributes statistical uncertainty to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of rates of phenotypic evolution, and many comparative evolutionary biologists regard the tree as a nuisance parameter. In this article, we present a framework for analytically integrating over unknown phylogenetic trees in comparative evolutionary studies by assuming that the tree arises from a continuous-time Markov branching model called the Yule process. To do this, we derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of phylogenetic diversity (PD), which is the sum of branch lengths connecting the species in a clade. We then present a generalization of PD which is equivalent to the expected trait disparity in a set of taxa whose evolutionary relationships are generated by a Yule process and whose traits evolve by Brownian motion. We find expressions for the distribution of expected trait disparity under a Yule tree.

Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p>Genome-scale data offer the opportunity to clarify phylogenetic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify genomic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-genome sequence data from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference genome to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous sites. We used this data set to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate phylogenetic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates and to identify specific genomic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic data set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the data reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the data. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the data supports a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated from 500-site sliding windows revealed genome regions supporting several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

Southern African ancient genomes estimate modern human divergence to 350,000 to 260,000 years ago
<p>Southern Africa is consistently placed as a potential region for the evolution of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. We present genome sequences, up to 13x coverage, from seven ancient individuals from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The remains of three Stone Age hunter-gatherers (about 2000 years old) were genetically similar to current-day southern San groups, and those of four Iron Age farmers (300 to 500 years old) were genetically similar to present-day Bantu-language speakers.

Midbrain dopamine neurons control judgment of time
<p>Our sense of time is far from constant. For instance, time flies when we are having fun, and it slows to a trickle when we are bored. Midbrain dopamine neurons have been implicated in variable time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation. However, a direct link between signals carried by dopamine neurons and temporal judgments is lacking. We measured and manipulated the activity of dopamine neurons as mice judged the duration of time intervals. We found that pharmacogenetic suppression of dopamine neurons decreased behavioral sensitivity to time and that dopamine neurons encoded information about trial-to-trial variability in time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates. Last, we found that transient activation or inhibition of dopamine neurons was sufficient to slow down or speed up time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation, respectively.

Y Chromosome Analysis of Dingoes and Southeast Asian Village Dogs Suggests a Neolithic Continental Expansion from Southeast Asia Followed by Multiple Austronesian Dispersals
<p>Dogs originated more than 14,000 BP, but the location(s) where they first arose is uncertain. The earliest archeological evidence of ancient dogs was discovered in Europe and the Middle East, some 5–7 millennia before that from Southeast Asia. However, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that most modern dogs derive from Southeast Asia, which has fueled the controversial hypothesis that dog domestication originated in this region despite the lack of supporting archeological evidence. We propose and investigate with Y chromosomes an alternative hypothesis for the proximate origins of dogs from Southeast Asia—a massive Neolithic expansion of dogs from this region that largely replaced more primitive dogs to the west and north. Previous attempts to test matrilineal findings with independent patrilineal markers have lacked the necessary genealogical resolution and mutation rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates. Here, we used Y chromosome genotypes, composed of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 5 single tandem repeats (STRs), from 338 Australian dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, and village dogs from Island Southeast Asia, along with modern European breed dogs, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate the evolutionary mutation rates of Y chromosome STRs based on calibration to the independently known age of the dingo population. Dingoes exhibited a unique haplogroup characterized by a single distinguishing SNP mutation and 14 STR haplotypes. The age of the European haplogroup was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated to be only 1.7 times older than that of the dingo population, suggesting an origin during the Neolithic rather than the Paleolithic (as predicted by the Southeast Asian origins hypothesis). We hypothesize that isolation of Neolithic dogs from wolves in Southeast Asia was a key step accelerating their phenotypic transformation, enhancing their value in trade and as cargo, and enabling them to rapidly expand and replace more primitive dogs to the West. Our findings also suggest that dingoes could have arrived in Australia directly from Taiwan, independently of later dispersals of dogs through Thailand to Island Southeast Asia.</p>

Cancer prevalence in this population is higher than in the general population.

We measured cumulative numbers of LDIR-related cardiac procedures for each patient until 1 year before the time of cancer diagnosis or administrative censoring. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> the association between LDIR exposure and cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study and matched cancer cases with controls on sex, CHD severity, birth year, and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study included 24 833 adult patients with CHD aged 18 to 64 years from 1995 to 2009. In >250 791 person-years of follow-up, 602 cancer cases were observed (median age, 55.4 years). The cumulative incidence of cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated up to 64 years of age was 15.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.2–16.5). Cases had more LDIR-related cardiac procedures than controls (1410 versus 921 per 1000 adult patients with CHD, <i>P</i><0.0001). Cumulative LDIR exposure was independently associated with cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13).

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction

In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were performed: patients with ST-segment–elevation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated at all time points.

Consequently, edema extent measured by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to values measured by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–elevation MI edema highlight the need for standardization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a time window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for standardization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

Outcome of the Swedish Nationwide Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Program
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A general abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening program, targeting 65-year-old men, has gradually been introduced in Sweden since 2006 and reached nationwide coverage in 2015. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of this program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data on the number of invited and examined men, screening-detected AAAs, AAAs operated on, and surgical outcome were retrieved from all 21 Swedish counties for the years 2006 through 2014. AAA-specific mortality data were retrieved from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. A linear regression analysis was used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate the effect on AAA-specific mortality among all men ≥65 years of age for the observed time period. The long-term effects were projected by using a validated Markov model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 302 957 men aged 65 years invited, 84% attended. The prevalence of screening-detected AAA was 1.5%. After a mean of 4.5 years, 29% of patients with AAA had been operated on, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9% (1.3% after open repair and 0.3% after endovascular repair, <i>P</i><0.001). The introduction of screening was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-specific mortality (mean, 4.0% per year of screening, <i>P</i>=0.020). The number needed to screen and the number needed to operate on to prevent 1 premature death were 667 and 1.5, respectively. With a total population of 9.5 million, the Swedish national AAA-screening program was predicted to annually prevent 90 premature deaths from AAA and to gain 577 quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-efficiency ratio was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated to be €7770 per quality-adjusted life-years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Screening 65-year-old men for AAA is an effective preventive health measure and is highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective in a contemporary setting.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Fetal Cardiac Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The goal of this statement is to review available literature and to put forth a scientific statement on the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis and management of fetal cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association reviewed the available literature pertaining to topics relevant to fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and arrhythmias, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment of cardiac function and the cardiovascular system, and available treatment options. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal diagnosis, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical management for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for diseases affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention strategies to prevent the progression of disease in utero are also discussed. Recommendations for delivery planning strategies for fetuses with congenital heart disease including models based on classification of disease severity and delivery room treatment will be highlighted. Outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment is reviewed to show the benefit of prenatal diagnosis and management as they affect outcome for babies with congenital heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Fetal cardiac medicine has evolved considerably over the past 2 decades, predominantly in response to advances in imaging technology and innovations in therapies. The diagnosis of cardiac disease in the fetus is mostly made with ultrasound; however, new technologies, including 3- and 4-dimensional echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal electrocardiography and magnetocardiography, are available. Medical and interventional treatments for select diseases and strategies for delivery room care enable stabilization of high-risk fetuses and contribute to improved outcomes. This statement highlights what is currently known and recommended on the basis of evidence and experience in the rapidly advancing and highly specialized field of fetal cardiac care.</p></sec>

<i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> Infective Endocarditis
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Because of the nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycosides, the Danish guidelines on infective endocarditis were changed in January 2007, reducing gentamicin treatment in enterococcal infective endocarditis from 4 to 6 weeks to only 2 weeks. In this pilot study, we compare outcomes in patients with <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> infective endocarditis treated in the years before and after endorsement of these new recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A total of 84 consecutive patients admitted with definite left-sided <i>E faecalis</i> endocarditis in the period of 2002 to 2011 were enrolled. Forty-one patients were treated before and 43 patients were treated after January 1, 2007. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. At hospitalization, the 2 groups had similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rates of 66 and 75 mL/min (<i>P</i>=0.22). Patients treated before January 2007 received gentamicin for a significantly longer period (28 versus 14 days; <i>P</i><0.001). The primary outcome, 1-year event-free survival, did not differ: 66% versus 69%, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.75).

The longer duration of gentamicin treatment is associated with worse renal function. Although the certainty of the clinical outcomes is limited by the sample size, outcomes appear to be no worse with the shorter treatment duration. Randomized, controlled studies are warranted to substantiate these results.</p></sec>

Plastic waste associated with disease on coral reefs
<p>Plastic waste can promote microbial colonization by pathogens implicated in outbreaks of disease in the ocean. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed the influence of plastic waste on disease risk in 124,000 reef-building corals from 159 reefs in the Asia-Pacific region. The likelihood of disease increases from 4% to 89% when corals are in contact with plastic. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be affected by plastic, suggesting that microhabitats for reef-associated organisms and valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. Plastic levels on coral reefs correspond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of terrestrial mismanaged plastic waste entering the ocean. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate that 11.1 billion plastic items are entangled on coral reefs across the Asia-Pacific and project this number to increase 40% by 2025.

Estimating the health benefits of environmental regulations
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ing health benefits of policies addressing environmental contaminants is important for decision-making and for informing the public about how policy affects their welfare (<i>1</i>). Benefits analysis, one side of benefit-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> analysis (BCA), can be relatively straightforward when sufficient data are available on dose-response relationships, changes in exposure expected from a proposed policy, and other key inputs. But despite progress, benefits analysis for health effects is needlessly constrained by analytic practices that are scientifically outdated and inconsistent with economic theory. These limitations can result in exclusion of important health effects from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated benefits of reducing exposure to toxic environmental contaminants, which, in turn, affects net benefits calculations that inform public policy.

Ultrafast Approximation for Phylogenetic Bootstrap
<p>Nonparametric bootstrap has been a widely used tool in phylogenetic analysis to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> the clade support of phylogenetic trees. However, with the rapidly growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amount</span></strong> of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, approximation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to compute the support of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>es the convergence of branch support values to automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate trees. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66–33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32–41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the support values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap support. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at <ext-link>http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree</ext-link>) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.</p>

Evolutionary capacity of upper thermal limits: beyond single trait assessments
<p>Thermal tolerance is an important factor influencing the distribution of ectotherms, but we still have limited understanding of the ability of species to evolve different thermal limits. Recent studies suggest that species may have limited capacity to evolve higher thermal limits in response to slower, more ecologically relevant rates of warming. However, these conclusions are based on univariate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of adaptive capacity. To test these findings within an explicitly multivariate context, we used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate the multivariate evolutionary potential for upper thermal limits in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed heat tolerance using static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero only for the static measures of heat tolerance. Our <bold>G</bold> matrix analysis revealed that any response to selection for increased heat tolerance will largely be driven by static basal and hardened heat tolerance, with minimal contribution from ramping heat tolerance. These results suggest that the capacity to evolve upper thermal limits in nature may depend on the type of thermal stress experienced.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In addition, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour.</p>

Value of Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification for Risk Prediction of Coronary and Cardiovascular Events

Hard coronary and cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events including revascularization, as well, were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8±2.2 years after the second CT. The added predictive value of 10 CAC progression algorithms on top of risk factors including baseline CAC was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by using survival analysis, C-statistics, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination index. A subgroup analysis of risk in CAC categories was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed 85 (2.6%) hard coronary, 161 (4.9%) hard cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for hard/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive value of baseline CT and risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment in terms of C-statistic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not improve models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year risk factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and hard/total cardiovascular risk: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively. When CAC<sub>b</sub> progressed from 1 to 399 to CAC<sub>5y</sub>≥400, coronary and total cardiovascular risk were nearly 2-fold in comparison with subjects who remained below CAC<sub>5y</sub>=400.

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients.

Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between diffusion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6.

PCSK9 Variants, Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, and Neurocognitive Impairment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Despite concerns about adverse neurocognitive events raised by prior trials, pharmacological PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9) inhibition was not associated with neurocognitive effects in a recent phase 3 randomized trial. PCSK9 loss-of-function (LOF) variants that result in lifelong exposure to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol can provide information on the potential long-term effects of lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on neurocognitive impairment and decline.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the association between PCSK9 LOF variants and neurocognitive impairment and decline among black REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) participants with (n=241) and without (n=10 454) C697X or Y142X LOF variants. Neurocognitive tests included the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) battery (Word List Learning, World List Delayed Recall, Semantic Animal Fluency) and Six-Item Screener (SIS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ments, administered longitudinally during follow-up. Neurocognitive impairment was defined as a score ≥1.5 SD below age, sex, and education-based stratum-specific means on 2 or 3 CERAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ments or, separately, a score <5 on any SIS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment at baseline or during follow-up. Neurocognitive decline was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed using standardized continuous scores on individual neurocognitive tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean sample age was 64 years (SD, 9), 62% were women, and the prevalence of neurocognitive impairment at any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment was 6.3% by CERAD and 15.4% by SIS definitions. Adjusted odds ratios for neurocognitive impairment for participants with versus without PCSK9 LOF variants were 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58–2.13) using the CERAD battery and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.61–1.30) using the SIS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment. Standardized average differences in individual neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment scores over the 5.6-year (range, 0.1–9.1) study period ranged between 0.07 (95% CI, −0.06 to 0.20) and −0.07 (95% CI, −0.18 to 0.05) among participants with versus without PCSK9 LOF variants. Patterns of neurocognitive decline were similar between participants with and without PCSK9 LOF variants (all <i>P</i>>0.10). Odds ratios for neurocognitive impairment per 20 mg/dL low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decrements were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96–1.08) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95–1.02) for the CERAD and SIS definitions of impairment, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results suggest that lifelong exposure to low PCSK9 levels and cumulative exposure to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are not associated with neurocognitive effects in blacks.</p></sec>

Prognostic Value of Coronary Artery Calcium in the PROMISE Study (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an established predictor of future major adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals. However, limited data exist as to how CAC compares with functional testing (FT) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ating prognosis in symptomatic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain (or dyspnea) and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease were randomized to FT (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or anatomic testing. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated those who underwent CAC testing as part of the anatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation (n=4209) and compared that with results of FT (n=4602). We stratified CAC and FT results as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al or mildly, moderately, or severely ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al (for CAC: 0, 1–99 Agatston score [AS], 100–400 AS, and >400 AS, respectively; for FT: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al, mild=late positive treadmill, moderate=early positive treadmill or single-vessel ischemia, and severe=large ischemic region ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>ality). The primary end point was all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization over a median follow-up of 26.1 months. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and C statistics to determine predictive and discriminatory values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al or mildly, moderately, or severely ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al test results was significantly different between FT and CAC (FT: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al, n=3588 [78.0%]; mild, n=432 [9.4%]; moderate, n=217 [4.7%]; severe, n=365 [7.9%]; CAC: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al, n=1457 [34.6%]; mild, n=1340 [31.8%]; moderate, n=772 [18.3%]; severe, n=640 [15.2%]; <i>P</i><0.0001). Moderate and severe ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>alities in both arms robustly predicted events (moderate: CAC: HR, 3.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.81–5.44; and FT: HR, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–4.83; severe: CAC: HR, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.99–6.36; and FT: HR, 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 2.58–5.85). In the CAC arm, the majority of events (n=112 of 133, 84%) occurred in patients with any positive CAC test (score >0), whereas fewer than half of events occurred in patients with mildly, moderately, or severely ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al FT (n=57 of 132, 43%; <i>P</i><0.001). In contrast, any ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>ality on FT was significantly more specific for predicting events (78.6% for FT versus 35.2% for CAC; <i>P</i><0.001). Overall discriminatory ability in predicting the primary end point of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina hospitalization was similar and fair for both CAC and FT (C statistic, 0.67 versus 0.64). Coronary computed tomographic angiography provided significantly better prognostic information compared with FT and CAC testing (C index, 0.72).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among stable outpatients presenting with suspected coronary artery disease, most patients experiencing clinical events have measurable CAC at baseline, and fewer than half have any ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>alities on FT. However, an ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al FT was more specific for cardiovascular events, leading to overall similarly modest discriminatory abilities of both tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22–1.69; <i>P</i>=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Screening with twice-weekly single-lead iECG with remote interpretation in ambulatory patients ≥65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12-month period. This approach is also highly acceptable to this group of patients, supporting further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation in an appropriately powered, event-driven clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial component fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-active molecules that can lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es as well as insoluble lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants. Lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants showed strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e activity that reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ing hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the seed mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole seed. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> mucilage formation.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>, represents an essential sealing component controlling water and solute movement and protecting seed from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components controlling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator controlling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during seed development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ing either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ing promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Obstruction of pilus retraction stimulates bacterial surface sensing
<p>It is critical for bacteria to recognize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact and initiate physiological changes required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-associated lifestyles. Ubiquitous microbial appendages called pili are involved in sensing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es and facilitating downstream behaviors, but the mechanism by which pili mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e sensing has been unclear. We visualized <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> pili undergoing dynamic cycles of extension and retraction. Within seconds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact, these cycles ceased, which coincided with synthesis of the adhesive holdfast required for attachment. Physically blocking pili imposed resistance to pilus retraction, which was sufficient to stimulate holdfast synthesis without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact. Thus, to sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, bacteria use the resistance on retracting, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-bound pili that occurs upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>s, and their expression requires seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

The primary safety end point was freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days, and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months.

RORγt limits the amount of the cytokine receptor γc through the prosurvival factor Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in developing thymocytes
<p>The cytokine receptor subunit γc provides critical signals for T cell survival and differentiation. We investigated the molecular mechanism that controls the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e abundance of γc during T cell development in the thymus. We found that the amount of γc was low on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) thymocytes before their positive selection to become mature T cells. The transcription factor RORγt was abundant in immature DP thymocytes, and its loss resulted in an increase in the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc, specifically on preselection DP cells. Rather than directly repressing expression of the gene encoding γc, RORγt acted through the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> to reduce the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc, which resulted in decreased cytokine signaling and was associated with inhibition of cell metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, overexpression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in RORγt-deficient thymocytes restored the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc to that present on normal preselection DP cells. Together, these data highlight a previously unappreciated role for RORγt and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in limiting γc abundance at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e and reveal a signaling circuit in which survival factors control cytokine signaling by limiting the abundance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e distribution of a receptor subunit shared by several cytokines.</p>

Low–interfacial toughness materials for effective large-scale deicing
<p>Ice accretion has adverse effects on a range of commercial and residential activities. The force required to remove ice from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e is typically considered to scale with the iced area. This imparts a scalability limit to the use of icephobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ings for structures with large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e areas, such as power lines or ship hulls. We describe a class of materials that exhibit a low interfacial toughness with ice, resulting in systems for which the forces required to remove large areas of ice (a few square centimeters or greater) are both low and independent of the iced area. We further demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ings made of such materials allow ice to be shed readily from large areas (~1 square meter) merely by self-weight.</p>

Tunable intrinsic strain in two-dimensional transition metal electrocatalysts
<p>Tuning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e strain is a powerful strategy for tailoring the reactivity of metal catalysts. Traditionally, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e strain is imposed by external stress from a heterogeneous substrate, but the effect is often obscured by interfacial reconstructions and nanocatalyst geometries. Here, we report on a strategy to resolve these problems by exploiting intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e stresses in two-dimensional transition metal nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations indicate that attractive interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e atoms lead to tensile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e stresses that exert a pressure on the order of 10<sup>5</sup> atmospheres on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e atoms and impart up to 10% compressive strain, with the exact magnitude inversely proportional to the nanosheet thickness. Atomic-level control of thickness thus enables generation and fine-tuning of intrinsic strain to optimize catalytic reactivity, which was confirmed experimentally on Pd(110) nanosheets for the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, with activity enhancements that were more than an order of magnitude greater than those of their nanoparticle counterparts.</p>

Adaptive introgression underlies polymorphic seasonal camouflage in snowshoe hares
<p>Snowshoe hares (<i>Lepus americanus</i>) maintain seasonal camouflage by molting to a white winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>, but some hares remain brown during the winter in regions with low snow cover. We show that cis-regulatory variation controlling seasonal expression of the <i>Agouti</i> gene underlies this adaptive winter camouflage polymorphism. Genetic variation at <i>Agouti</i> clustered by winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> color across multiple hare and jackrabbit species, revealing a history of recurrent interspecific gene flow. Brown winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>s in snowshoe hares likely originated from an introgressed black-tailed jackrabbit allele that has swept to high frequency in mild winter environments. These discoveries show that introgression of genetic variants that underlie key ecological traits can seed past and ongoing adaptation to rapidly changing environments.</p>

A nanoscale reorganization of the IL-15 receptor is triggered by NKG2D in a ligand-dependent manner
<p>Natural killer group 2D (NKG2D), an activating receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and a subset of T cells, recognizes stress-inducible proteins, including MICA and ULBP2, which are present on infected or transformed cells. Whether each NKG2D ligand (NKG2DL) has a distinct biological role is not clear. Using superresolution microscopy, we found that NKG2D is constitutively arranged in nanoclusters at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e of human primary NK cells. Nanoclusters of NKG2D became smaller upon ligation with MICA but became larger upon activation by ULBP2. In addition, ULBP2 induced the reorganization of nanoclusters of the cytokine receptor subunit for both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-15 (IL-2/IL-15Rβ), such that these cytokine receptor subunits coalesced with nanoclusters of NKG2D. Functionally, the response of NK cells activated by ULBP2 was augmented by an interaction between ULBP2-bound NKG2D and IL-15R ligated by IL-15 (trans-presented by IL-15Rα–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es). These data suggest that NKG2DLs are not equivalent in their capacity to activate NKG2D and establish a previously unknown paradigm in how ligand-induced changes to the nanoscale organization of the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e can affect immune responses.</p>

Global extent of rivers and streams

Selective increase in CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction activity at grain-boundary surface terminations
<p>Altering a material’s catalytic properties requires identifying structural features that give rise to active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. Grain boundaries create strained regions in polycrystalline materials by stabilizing dislocations and may provide a way to create high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es for catalysis that are kinetically trapped. Although grain-boundary density has previously been correlated with catalytic activity for some reactions, direct evidence that grain boundaries create <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es with enhanced activity is lacking. We used a combination of bulk electrochemical measurements and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with submicrometer resolution to show that grain-boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e terminations in gold electrodes are more active than grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) reduction to carbon monoxide (CO) but not for the competing hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) evolution reaction. The catalytic footprint of the grain boundary is commensurate with its dislocation-induced strain field, providing a strategy for broader exploitation of grain-boundary effects in heterogeneous catalysis.</p>

Second messenger–mediated tactile response by a bacterial rotary motor

This led to the allosteric activation of the glycosyltransferase HfsJ to promote rapid synthesis of a polysaccharide adhesin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e anchoring. Although the membrane-embedded motor unit was essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e sensing, mutants that lack external flagellar structures were hypersensitive to mechanical stimuli.

A Multilevel Study of Melon Fruit Reticulation Provides Insight into Skin Ligno-Suberization Hallmarks
<p>The skin of fleshy fruit is typically covered by a thick cuticle. Some fruit species develop different forms of layers directly above their skin. Reticulation, for example, is a specialized suberin-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ing that ornaments some commercially important melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) fruit and is an important quality trait. Despite its importance, the structural, molecular, and biochemical features associated with reticulation are not fully understood. Here, we performed a multilevel investigation of structural attributes, chemical composition, and gene expression profiles on a set of reticulated and smooth skin melons. High-resolution microscopy, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e profiling, and histochemical staining assays show that reticulation comprises cells with heavily suberized walls accumulating large amounts of typical suberin monomers, as well as lignified cells localized underneath the specialized suberized cell layer. Reticulated skin was characterized by induced expression of biosynthetic genes acting in the core phenylpropanoid, suberin, lignin, and lignan pathways. Transcripts of genes associated with lipid polymer assembly, cell wall organization, and loosening were highly enriched in reticulated skin tissue. These signatures were exclusive to reticulated structures and absent in both the smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es observed in between reticulated regions and in the skin of smooth fruit. Our data provide important insights into the molecular and metabolic bases of reticulation and its tight association with skin ligno-suberization during melon fruit development. Moreover, these insights are likely to contribute to melon breeding programs aimed at improving postharvest qualities associated with fleshy fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e layers.</p>

Ligand-activated Notch undergoes DTX4-mediated ubiquitylation and bilateral endocytosis before ADAM10 processing
<p>The Notch signaling pathway, which is activated by cell-cell contact, is a major regulator of cell fate decisions. Mammalian Notch1 is present at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e as a heterodimer of the Notch extracellular domain associated with the transmembrane and intracellular domains. After ligand binding, Notch undergoes proteolysis, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that regulates gene expression. We monitored the early steps of activation with biochemical analysis, immunofluorescence analysis, and live-cell imaging of Notch1-expressing cells. We found that, upon ligand binding, Notch1 at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e was ubiquitylated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX4. This ubiquitylation event led to the internalization of the Notch1 extracellular domain by the ligand-expressing cell and the internalization of the membrane-anchored fragment of Notch1 and DTX4 by the Notch1-expressing cell, which we referred to as bilateral endocytosis. ADAM10 generates a cleavage product of Notch that is necessary for the formation of the NICD, which has been thought to occur at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. However, we found that blocking dynamin-mediated endocytosis of Notch1 and DTX4 reduced the colocalization of Notch1 with ADAM10 and the formation of the ADAM10-generated cleavage product of Notch1, suggesting that ADAM10 functions in an intracellular compartment to process Notch. Thus, this study suggests that a specific pool of ADAM10 acts on Notch in an endocytic compartment, rather than at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e.</p>

Dynamic gating of infrared radiation in a textile
<p>The human body absorbs and loses heat largely through infrared radiation centering around a wavelength of 10 micrometers. However, neither our skin nor the textiles that make up clothing are capable of dynamically controlling this optical channel for thermal management. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ing triacetate-cellulose bimorph fibers with a thin layer of carbon nanotubes, we effectively modulated the infrared radiation by more than 35% as the relative humidity of the underlying skin changed. Both experiments and modeling suggest that this dynamic infrared gating effect mainly arises from distance-dependent electromagnetic coupling between neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed fibers in the textile yarns. This effect opens a pathway for developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong>able localized thermal management systems that are autonomous and self-powered, as well as expanding our ability to adapt to demanding environments.</p>

A challenging multistep transformation enabled by C–F bond activation led to a dominolike coupling that yielded tailored nanographenes directly on the rutile titania <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. Because of efficient regioselective zipping, we obtained the target nanographenes from flexible precursors. Fluorine positions in the precursor structure unambiguously dictated the running of the “zipping program,” resulting in the rolling up of oligophenylene chains. The high efficiency of the hydrogen fluoride zipping makes our approach attractive for the rational synthesis of nanographenes and nanoribbons directly on insulating and semiconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es.</p>

High-affinity adsorption leads to molecularly ordered interfaces on TiO<sub>2</sub> in air and solution
<p>Researchers around the world have observed the formation of molecularly ordered structures of unknown origin on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e of titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) photocatalysts exposed to air and solution. Using a combination of atomic-scale microscopy and spectroscopy, we show that TiO<sub>2</sub> selectively adsorbs atmospheric carboxylic acids that are typically present in parts-per-billion concentrations while effectively repelling other adsorbates, such as alcohols, that are present in much higher concentrations. The high affinity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e for carboxylic acids is attributed to their bidentate binding. These self-assembled monolayers have the unusual property of being both hydrophobic and highly water-soluble, which may contribute to the self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clean</span></strong>ing properties of TiO<sub>2</sub>. This finding is relevant to TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysis, because the self-assembled carboxylate monolayers block the undercoordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e cation sites typically implicated in photocatalysis.</p>

Lectins modulate the microbiota of social amoebae
<p>The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> maintains a microbiome during multicellular development; bacteria are carried in migrating slugs and as endosymbionts within amoebae and spores. Bacterial carriage and endosymbiosis are induced by the secreted lectin discoidin I that binds bacteria, protects them from extracellular killing, and alters their retention within amoebae. This altered handling of bacteria also occurs with bacteria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed by plant lectins and leads to DNA transfer from bacteria to amoebae. Thus, lectins alter the cellular response of <i>D. discoideum</i> to bacteria to establish the amoebae’s microbiome. Mammalian cells can also maintain intracellular bacteria when presented with bacteria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed with lectins, so heterologous lectins may induce endosymbiosis in animals. Our results suggest that endogenous or environmental lectins may influence microbiome homeostasis across eukaryotic phylogeny.</p>

Winter color polymorphisms identify global hot spots for evolutionary rescue from climate change
<p>Maintenance of biodiversity in a rapidly changing climate will depend on the efficacy of evolutionary rescue, whereby population declines due to abrupt environmental change are reversed by shifts in genetically driven adaptive traits. However, a lack of traits known to be under direct selection by anthropogenic climate change has limited the incorporation of evolutionary processes into global conservation efforts. In 21 vertebrate species, some individuals undergo a seasonal color molt from summer brown to winter white as camouflage against snow, whereas other individuals remain brown. Seasonal snow duration is decreasing globally, and fitness is lower for winter white animals on snowless backgrounds. Based on 2713 georeferenced samples of known winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> color—from eight species across trophic levels—we identify environmentally driven clinal gradients in winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> color, including polymorphic zones where winter brown and white morphs co-occur. These polymorphic zones, underrepresented by existing global protected area networks, indicate hot spots for evolutionary rescue in a changing climate.</p>

Tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices pinch collagen fibers to support 3D cell migration
<p>Migrating cells often use focal adhesions in order to move. Focal adhesions are less prominent in cells migrating in three-dimensional (3D) as compared with 2D environments. We looked for alternative adhesion structures supporting cell migration. We analyzed the dynamics of clathrin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed pits in cells migrating in a 3D environment of collagen fibers. Both topological cues and local engagement of integrins triggered the accumulation of clathrin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed structures on fibers. Clathrin/adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) lattices pinched collagen fibers by adopting a tube-like morphology and regulated adhesion to fibers in an endocytosis-independent manner. During migration, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices stabilized cellular protrusions by providing anchoring points to collagen fibers. Thus, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices promote cell adhesion that, in coordination with focal adhesions, supports cell migration in 3D.</p>

Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive radiative cooling draws heat from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es and radiates it into space as infrared radiation to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared radiation flux from a near-ambient-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ing, the metamaterial shows a noontime radiative cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting radiative cooling as a viable energy technology.</p>

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p>Ice formation on aerosol particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level. This is partly because the nature of active sites, local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e features where ice growth commences, is still unclear. Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e, exposed at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e defects such as steps, cracks, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high ice nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar particles.</p>

Extensive water ice within Ceres’ aqueously altered regolith: Evidence from nuclear spectroscopy
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e elemental composition of dwarf planet Ceres constrains its regolith ice content, aqueous alteration processes, and interior evolution. Using nuclear spectroscopy data acquired by NASA’s Dawn mission, we determined the concentrations of elemental hydrogen, iron, and potassium on Ceres. The data show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e materials were processed by the action of water within the interior. The non-icy portion of Ceres’ carbon-bearing regolith contains similar amounts of hydrogen to those present in aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites; however, the concentration of iron on Ceres is lower than in the aforementioned chondrites. This allows for the possibility that Ceres experienced modest ice-rock fractionation, resulting in differences between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e and bulk composition. At mid-to-high latitudes, the regolith contains high concentrations of hydrogen, consistent with broad expanses of water ice, confirming theoretical predictions that ice can survive for billions of years just beneath the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e.</p>

3D Imaging of Tapetal Mitochondria Suggests the Importance of Mitochondrial Fission in Pollen Growth
<p>Mitochondrial fission occurs frequently in plant cells, but its biological significance is poorly understood because mutants specifically impaired in mitochondrial fission do not show obvious defects in vegetative growth. Here, we revealed that the production of viable pollen was reduced in mutants lacking one of the three main proteins involved in mitochondrial fission in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3A (DRP3A)/Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-LIKE PROTEIN2A, DRP3B, and ELONGATED MITOCHONDRIA1 (ELM1). In <i>drp3b</i> and <i>elm1</i>, young microspores contained an abnormal number of nuclei, and mature pollen had aberrant accumulation of lipids in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> and an irregular pollen outer wall. Because the formation of the pollen wall and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> is mainly associated with tapetal function, we used 3D imaging to quantify geometric and textural features of cells and mitochondria in the tapetum at different stages, using isolated single tapetal cells in which the in vivo morphology and volume of cells and mitochondria were preserved. Tapetal cells and their mitochondria changed in the volume and morphology at different developmental stages. Defective mitochondrial fission in the <i>elm1</i> and <i>drp3b</i> mutants caused changes in mitochondrial status, including mitochondrial elongation, abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure, a decrease in cross-sectional area, and a slight alteration of mitochondrial distribution, as well as a large reduction in mitochondrial density. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial fission is required for proper mitochondrial status in the tapetum and possibly in pollen as well and therefore plays an important role for the production of viable pollen.</p>

Awake1, an ABC-Type Transporter, Reveals an Essential Role for Suberin in the Control of Seed Dormancy
<p>The mother plant plays an important dynamic role in the control of dormancy of her progeny seed in response to environmental signals. In order to further understand the mechanisms by which this dormancy control takes place in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we conducted a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants that fail to enter dormancy in response to variation in temperature during seed set. We show that, for the first of these mutants, designated <i>awake1</i>, the maternal allele is required for entry into strongly dormant states and that <i>awake1</i> mutants show seed phenotypes shown previously to be associated with the loss of suberin in the seed. We identify <i>awake1</i> as an allele of <i>ABCG20</i>, an ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene required for the transport of fatty acids during suberin deposition, and show that further suberin-deficient mutants have seed dormancy defects. Seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> suberin composition is affected by temperature during seed maturation, but this response appears to be independent of ABCG20. We conclude that seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> suberin is essential for seed dormancy imposition by low temperature and that the exclusion of oxygen and water from the seed by the suberin and tannin layers is important for dormancy imposition.</p>

MONENSIN SENSITIVITY1 (MON1)/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-Mediated Rab7 Activation Regulates Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD)-triggered degradation of plant tapetum is essential for microspore development and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> formation; however, little is known about the cellular mechanism regulating tapetal PCD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab7-mediated vacuolar transport of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases is crucial for tapetal PCD and pollen development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with the following evidence: (1) The <i>monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>mon1</i>) mutants, which are defective in Rab7 activation, showed impaired male fertility due to a combined defect in both tapetum and male gametophyte development. (2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and pollen. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> formation and decreased male fertility. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-mediated Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-mediated vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in defective pollen germination and tube growth. Taken together, tapetal PCD and pollen development require successful MON1/CCZ1-mediated vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

The as-cleaved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e in vacuum is frozen in place but immediately responds with an insulator-to-metal transition and possibly ferroelectric lattice distortions.

The optimal solution is found after exposure to water vapor through the formation of a hydroxylated overlayer with ideal geometry and charge.</p>

This yields fibers with unnatural properties such as fluorescence or magnetism. Combining biological systems with the appropriate molecular design offers numerous possibilities to grow functional composite materials and implements a material-farming concept.</p>

Acoustic mirrors as sensory traps for bats
<p>Sensory traps pose a considerable and often fatal risk for animals, leading them to misinterpret their environment. Bats predominantly rely on their echolocation system to forage, orientate, and navigate. We found that bats can mistake smooth, vertical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es as clear flight paths, repeatedly colliding with them, likely as a result of their acoustic mirror properties. The probability of collision is influenced by the number of echolocation calls and by the amount of time spent in front of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. The echolocation call analysis corroborates that bats perceive smooth, vertical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es as open flyways. Reporting on occurrences with different species in the wild, we argue that it is necessary to more closely monitor potentially dangerous locations with acoustic mirror properties (such as glass fronts) to assess the true frequency of fatalities around these sensory traps.</p>

Detailed investigations across multiple length scales—from the molecular-scale characterization of deposited adhesive proteins to nanoscale contact mechanics to macroscale live observations—suggest that lubricant infusion considerably reduces fouling by deceiving the mechanosensing ability of mussels, deterring secretion of adhesive threads, and decreasing the molecular work of adhesion. Our study demonstrates that lubricant infusion represents an effective strategy to mitigate marine biofouling and provides insights into the physical mechanisms underlying adhesion prevention.</p>

The former adheres to the substrate by electrostatic interactions, covalent bonds, and physical interpenetration. The latter amplifies energy dissipation through hysteresis. The two layers synergistically lead to higher adhesion energies on wet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es as compared with those of existing adhesives. Adhesion occurs within minutes, independent of blood exposure and compatible with in vivo dynamic movements. This family of adhesives may be useful in many areas of application, including tissue adhesives, wound dressings, and tissue repair.</p>

Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.</p>

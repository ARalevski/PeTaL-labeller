Distinct Functions of STARCH SYNTHASE 4 Domains in Starch Granule Formation
<p>The formation of normal starch granules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf chloroplasts requires STARCH SYNTHASE 4 (SS4). In plants lacking SS4, chloroplasts typically produce only one round granule rather than multiple lenticular granules. The mechanisms by which SS4 de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>es granule number and morphology are not understood. The N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of SS4 is unique among SS isoforms and contains several long coiled-coil motifs, typically implicated in protein-protein interactions. The C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region contains the catalytic glucosyltransferase domains, which are widely conserved in plant SS and bacterial glycogen synthase (GS) isoforms. We investigated the specific roles of the N- and C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al regions of SS4 by expressing truncated versions of SS4 and a fusion between the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of SS4 and GS in the Arabidopsis <i>ss4</i> mutant. Expression of the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of SS4 alone did not alter the <i>ss4</i> mutant phenotype. Expression of the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of SS4 alone increased granule initiation but did not rescue their aberrant round morphology. Expression of a self-priming GS from <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> also increased the number of round granules. Remarkably, fusion of the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of SS4 to <i>A. tumefaciens</i> GS restored the development of wild-type-like lenticular starch granules. Interestingly, the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of SS4 alone or when fused to GS conferred a patchy subchloroplastic localization similar to that of the full-length SS4 protein. Considered together, these data suggest that, while the glucosyltransferase activity of SS4 is important for granule initiation, the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al part of SS4 serves to establish the correct granule morphology by properly localizing this activity.</p>

Ultrafast Approximation for Phylogenetic Bootstrap
<p>Nonparametric bootstrap has been a widely used tool in phylogenetic analysis to assess the clade <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> of phylogenetic trees. However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, approximation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to compute the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> values to automatically de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>e when to stop collecting candidate trees. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66–33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32–41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at <ext-link>http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree</ext-link>) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.</p>

Local protein synthesis is a ubiquitous feature of neuronal pre- and postsynaptic compartments
<p>There is ample evidence for localization of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites; however, demonstrations of these processes in presynaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>als are limited. We used expansion microscopy to resolve pre- and postsynaptic compartments in rodent neurons. Most presynaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>als in the hippocampus and forebrain contained mRNA and ribosomes. We sorted fluorescently labeled mouse brain synaptosomes and then sequenced hundreds of mRNA species present within excitatory boutons. After brief metabolic labeling, >30% of all presynaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>als exhibited a signal, providing evidence for ongoing protein synthesis. We tested different classic plasticity paradigms and observed distinct patterns of rapid pre- and/or postsynaptic translation. Thus, presynaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>als are translationally competent, and local protein synthesis is differentially recruited to drive compartment-specific phenotypes that underlie different forms of plasticity.</p>

Flagellar microtubule doublet assembly in vitro reveals a regulatory role of tubulin C-terminal tails
<p>Microtubule doublets (MTDs), consisting of an incomplete B-microtubule at the surface of a complete A-microtubule, provide a structural scaffold mediating intraflagellar transport and ciliary beating. Despite the fundamental role of MTDs, the molecular mechanism governing their formation is unknown. We used a cell-free assay to demonstrate a crucial inhibitory role of the carboxyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al (C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al) tail of tubulin in MTD assembly. Removal of the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al tail of an assembled A-microtubule allowed for the nucleation of a B-microtubule on its surface. C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al tails of only one A-microtubule protofilament inhibited this side-to-surface tubulin interaction, which would be overcome in vivo with binding protein partners. The dynamics of B-microtubule nucleation and its distinctive isotropic elongation was elucidated by using live imaging. Thus, inherent interaction properties of tubulin provide a structural basis driving flagellar MTD assembly.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Unique Motifs and Length of Hairpin in Oleosin Target the Cytosolic Side of Endoplasmic Reticulum and Budding Lipid Droplet
<p>Plant cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) are covered with a layer of phospholipids and oleosin and were extensively studied before those in mammals and yeast. Oleosin has short amphipathic N- and C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al peptides flanking a conserved 72-residue hydrophobic hairpin, which penetrates and stabilizes the LD. Oleosin is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and extracts ER-budding LDs to cytosol. To delineate the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LD, we have expressed modified-oleosin genes in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> for transient expression and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY2 cells for stable transformation. The results have identified oleosin motifs for targeting ER-LD and oleosin as the sole molecule responsible for budding-LD entering cytosol. Both the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al and C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al peptides are not required for the targeting. The hairpin, including its entire length, initial N-portion residues, and hairpin-loop of three Pro and one Ser residues, as well as the absence of an N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al ER-targeting peptide, are necessary for oleosin targeting ER and moving onto budding LDs and extracting them to cytosol. In a reverse approach, eliminations of these necessities allow the modified oleosin to enter the ER lumen and extract budding LDs to the ER lumen. Modified oleosin with an added vacuole signal peptide transports the ER-luminal LDs to vacuoles. The overall findings define the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LDs and extracting budding LDs to the cytosol as well as reveal potential applications.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A murine <i>Zic3</i> transcript with a premature termination codon evades nonsense-mediated decay during axis formation
<p>The ZIC transcription factors are key mediators of embryonic development and <i>ZIC3</i> is the gene most commonly associated with <i>situs</i> defects (heterotaxy) in humans. Half of patient <i>ZIC3</i> mutations introduce a premature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ation codon (PTC). <i>In vivo</i>, PTC-containing transcripts might be targeted for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). NMD efficiency is known to vary greatly between transcripts, tissues and individuals and it is possible that differences in survival of PTC-containing transcripts partially explain the striking phenotypic variability that characterizes ZIC3-associated congenital defects. For example, the PTC-containing transcripts might encode a C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ally truncated protein that retains partial function or that dominantly interferes with other ZIC family members. Here we describe the katun (<i>Ka</i>) mouse mutant, which harbours a mutation in the <i>Zic3</i> gene that results in a PTC. At the time of axis formation there is no discernible decrease in this PTC-containing transcript <i>in vivo</i>, indicating that the mammalian <i>Zic3</i> transcript is relatively insensitive to NMD, prompting the need to re-examine the molecular function of the truncated proteins predicted from human studies and to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>e whether the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al portion of ZIC3 possesses dominant-negative capabilities. A combination of <i>in vitro</i> studies and analysis of the <i>Ka</i> phenotype indicate that it is a null allele of <i>Zic3</i> and that the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al portion of ZIC3 does not encode a dominant-negative molecule. Heterotaxy in patients with PTC-containing <i>ZIC3</i> transcripts probably arises due to loss of ZIC3 function alone.</p>

Stroma provides an intestinal stem cell niche in the absence of epithelial Wnts
<p>Wnt/β-catenin signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s intestinal homeostasis by regulating proliferation in the crypt. Multiple Wnts are expressed in Paneth cells as well as other intestinal epithelial and stromal cells. <i>Ex vivo</i>, Wnts secreted by Paneth cells can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> intestinal stem cells when Wnt signaling is enhanced with supplemental R-Spondin 1 (RSPO1). However, <i>in vivo</i>, the source of Wnts in the stem cell niche is less clear. Genetic ablation of <i>Porcn</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum resident O-acyltransferase that is essential for the secretion and activity of all vertebrate Wnts, confirmed the role of intestinal epithelial Wnts in <i>ex vivo</i> culture. Unexpectedly, mice lacking epithelial Wnt activity (<i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup>/Villin-Cre</i> mice) had normal intestinal proliferation and differentiation, as well as successful regeneration after radiation injury, indicating that epithelial Wnts are dispensable for these processes. Consistent with a key role for stroma in the crypt niche, intestinal stromal cells endogenously expressing Wnts and <i>Rspo3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> the growth of <i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup></i> organoids <i>ex vivo</i> without RSPO1 supplementation. Conversely, increasing pharmacologic PORCN inhibition, affecting both stroma and epithelium, reduced <i>Lgr5</i> intestinal stem cells, inhibited recovery from radiation injury, and at the highest dose fully blocked intestinal proliferation. We conclude that epithelial Wnts are dispensable and that stromal production of Wnts can fully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> normal murine intestinal homeostasis.</p>

Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p>Genome-scale data offer the opportunity to clarify phylogenetic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify genomic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-genome sequence data from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference genome to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous sites. We used this data set to estimate phylogenetic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic estimates and to identify specific genomic regions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic data set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the data reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the data. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships estimated from 500-site sliding windows revealed genome regions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

A general synthesis approach for supported bimetallic nanoparticles via surface inorganometallic chemistry

Closing the tubulin detyrosination cycle
<p>Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that drive chromosome segregation during cell division, control cell shape and motility, and serve as rails for motor protein-based intracellular transport. Microtubules are polymers built of highly conserved subunits, α- and β-tubulin, which contain a globular core and more variable C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al tails that are exposed at the microtubule surface. Although microtubules are structurally uniform, they display functional specialization due to the combination of different tubulin isoforms and multiple posttranslational modifications (<i>1</i>). Many of these modifications occur within the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al tails and affect microtubule interactions with motor proteins or regulatory factors. The first tubulin modifications were discovered more than 40 years ago and consist of the catalytic removal and reincorporation of the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al tyrosine, an amino acid residue that is present in most α-tubulin isotypes (see the figure) (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Whereas retyrosination of soluble tubulin is known to be mediated by tubulin-tyrosine ligase (<i>5</i>), α-tubulin detyrosination, which occurs preferentially on microtubules, is mediated by an unknown carboxypeptidase activity. On pages 1448 and 1453 of this issue, Aillaud <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) and Nieuwenhuis <i>et al.</i> (<i>7</i>) report the identification and characterization of vasohibins as long-sought tubulin carboxypeptidases.</p>

Polar Localization of the Borate Exporter BOR1 Requires AP2-Dependent Endocytosis
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element in plants but is toxic when it accumulates to high levels. In root cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the borate exporter BOR1 is polarly localized in the plasma membrane toward the stele side for directional transport of B. Upon high-B supply, BOR1 is rapidly internalized and degraded in the vacuole. The polar localization and B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 are mediated by endocytosis from the plasma membrane. To dissect the endocytic pathways mediating the polar localization and vacuolar sorting, we investigated the contribution of the clathrin adaptor protein, ADAPTOR PROTEIN2 (AP2) complex, to BOR1 trafficking. In the mutants lacking µ- or σ-subunits of the AP2 complex, the polar localization and constitutive endocytosis of BOR1 under low-B conditions were dramatically disturbed. A coimmunoprecipitation assay showed association of the AP2 complex with BOR1, while it was independent of YxxΦ sorting motifs, which are in a cytosolic loop of BOR1. A yeast two-hybrid assay <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ed the interaction of the AP2 complex µ-subunit with the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al tail but not with the YxxΦ motifs in the cytosolic loop of BOR1. Intriguingly, lack of the AP2 subunit did not affect the B-induced rapid internalization/vacuolar sorting of BOR1. Consistent with defects in the polar localization, the AP2 complex mutants showed hypersensitivity to B deficiency. Our results indicate that AP2-dependent endocytosis maintains the polar localization of BOR1 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> plant growth under low-B conditions, whereas the B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 is mediated through an AP2-independent endocytic pathway.</p>

Distinct Roles of Non-Overlapping Surface Regions of the Coiled-Coil Domain in the Potato Immune Receptor Rx1
<p>The intracellular immune receptor Rx1 of potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>), which confers effector-triggered immunity to <i>Potato virus X</i>, consists of a central nucleotide-binding domain (NB-ARC) flanked by a carboxyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and an amino-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al coiled-coil (CC) domain. Rx1 activity is strictly regulated by interdomain interactions between the NB-ARC and LRR, but the contribution of the CC domain in regulating Rx1 activity or immune signaling is not fully understood. Therefore, we used a structure-informed approach to investigate the role of the CC domain in Rx1 functionality. Targeted mutagenesis of CC surface residues revealed separate regions required for the intramolecular and intermolecular interaction of the CC with the NB-ARC-LRR and the cofactor Ran GTPase-activating protein2 (RanGAP2), respectively. None of the mutant Rx1 proteins was constitutively active, indicating that the CC does not contribute to the autoinhibition of Rx1 activity. Instead, the CC domain acted as a modulator of downstream responses involved in effector-triggered immunity. Systematic disruption of the hydrophobic interface between the four helices of the CC enabled the uncoupling of cell death and disease resistance responses. Moreover, a strong dominant negative effect on Rx1-mediated resistance and cell death was observed upon coexpression of the CC alone with full-length Rx1 protein, which depended on the RanGAP2-binding surface of the CC. Surprisingly, coexpression of the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al half of the CC enhanced Rx1-mediated resistance, which further indicated that the CC functions as a scaffold for downstream components involved in the modulation of disease resistance or cell death signaling.</p>

Cylindrical Inclusion Protein of Turnip Mosaic Virus Serves as a Docking Point for the Intercellular Movement of Viral Replication Vesicles
<p>Plant viruses move from the initially infected cell to adjacent cells through plasmodesmata (PDs). To do so, viruses encode dedicated protein(s) that facilitate this process. How viral proteins act together to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> the intercellular movement of viruses is poorly defined. Here, by using an infection-free intercellular vesicle movement assay, we investigate the action of CI (cylindrical inclusion) and P3N-PIPO (amino-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al half of P3 fused to Pretty Interesting Potyviridae open reading frame), the two PD-localized potyviral proteins encoded by <i>Turnip mosaic virus</i> (TuMV), in the intercellular movement of the viral replication vesicles. We provide evidence that CI and P3N-PIPO are sufficient to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> the PD targeting and intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles induced by 6K2, a viral protein responsible for the generation of replication vesicles. 6K2 interacts with CI but not P3N-PIPO. When this interaction is impaired, the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles is inhibited. Furthermore, in transmission electron microscopy, vesicular structures are observed in connection with the cylindrical inclusion bodies at structurally modified PDs in cells coexpressing 6K2, CI, and P3N-PIPO. CI is directed to PDs through its interaction with P3N-PIPO. We hypothesize that CI serves as a docking point for PD targeting and the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles. This work contributes to a better understanding of the roles of different viral proteins in coordinating the intercellular movement of viral replication vesicles.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to transfer their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing carotenoid transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase 1 Is Regulated by Its N-Terminal Domain in Response to Allosteric Effectors
<p>Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is an integral membrane enzyme catalyzing the final and committed step in the acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent biosynthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). The biochemical regulation of TAG assembly remains one of the least understood areas of primary metabolism to date. Here, we report that the hydrophilic N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain of <i>Brassica napus</i> DGAT1 (BnaDGAT1<sub>1-113</sub>) regulates activity based on acyl-CoA/CoA levels. The N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain is not necessary for acyltransferase activity and is composed of an intrinsically disordered region and a folded segment. We show that the disordered region has an autoinhibitory function and a dimerization interface, which appears to mediate positive cooperativity, whereas the folded segment of the cytosolic region was found to have an allosteric site for acyl-CoA/CoA. Under increasing acyl-CoA levels, the binding of acyl-CoA with this noncatalytic site facilitates homotropic allosteric activation. Enzyme activation, on the other hand, is prevented under limiting acyl-CoA conditions (low acyl-CoA-to-CoA ratio), whereby CoA acts as a noncompetitive feedback inhibitor through interaction with the same folded segment. The three-dimensional NMR solution structure of the allosteric site revealed an α-helix with a loop connecting a coil fragment. The conserved amino acid residues in the loop interacting with CoA were identified, revealing details of this important regulatory element for allosteric regulation. Based on these results, a model is proposed illustrating the role of the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain of BnaDGAT1 as a positive and negative modulator of TAG biosynthesis.</p>

Regulatory Phosphorylation of Bacterial-Type PEP Carboxylase by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Dependent Protein Kinase RcCDPK1 in Developing Castor Oil Seeds
<p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a tightly controlled cytosolic enzyme situated at a crucial branch point of central plant metabolism. In developing castor oil seeds (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) a novel, allosterically desensitized 910-kD Class-2 PEPC hetero-octameric complex, arises from a tight interaction between 107-kD plant-type PEPC and 118-kD bacterial-type (BTPC) subunits. The native Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) responsible for in vivo inhibitory phosphorylation of Class-2 PEPC’s BTPC subunit’s at Ser-451 was highly purified from COS and identified as RcCDPK1 (XP_002526815) by mass spectrometry. Heterologously expressed RcCDPK1 catalyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, inhibitory phosphorylation of BTPC at Ser-451 while exhibiting: (<i>i</i>) a pair of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites with identical dissociation constants of 5.03 μM, (<i>ii</i>) a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift, and (<i>iii</i>) a marked Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent hydrophobicity. Pull-down experiments established the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interaction of N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al GST-tagged RcCDPK1 with BTPC. RcCDPK1-Cherry localized to the cytosol and nucleus of tobacco bright yellow-2 cells, but colocalized with mitochondrial-surface associated BTPC-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein when both fusion proteins were coexpressed. Deletion analyses demonstrated that although its N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al variable domain plays an essential role in optimizing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent RcCDPK1 autophosphorylation and BTPC transphosphorylation activity, it is not critical for in vitro or in vivo target recognition. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPK4 and soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) CDPKβ are RcCDPK1 orthologs that effectively phosphorylated castor BTPC at Ser-451. Overall, the results highlight a potential link between cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and the posttranslational control of respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> refixation and anaplerotic photosynthate partitioning in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> of storage oil and protein biosynthesis in developing COS.</p>

Metabolic Control of Tobacco Pollination by Sugars and Invertases
<p>Pollination in flowering plants is initiated by germination of pollen grains on stigmas followed by fast growth of pollen tubes representing highly energy-consuming processes. The symplastic isolation of pollen grains and tubes requires import of Suc available in the apoplast. We show that the functional coupling of Suc cleavage by invertases and uptake of the released hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollination in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolocalization of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> the functional coupling in supplying carbohydrates for pollen germination and tube growth evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated expression. Detection of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk between male and female tissues and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ed the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollination. Tissue-specific expression of an invertase inhibitor and addition of the chemical invertase inhibitor miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired pollen germination. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously available Suc into the germinating pollen operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after cleavage by extracellular invertase. Reduction of extracellular invertase activity in pollen decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises pollen germination. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for pollen germination, whereas Suc is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing tube growth, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulation of pollination by carbohydrates.</p>

Homologues of the RPW8 Resistance Protein Are Localized to the Extrahaustorial Membrane that Is Likely Synthesized De Novo
<p>Upon penetration of the host cell wall, the powdery mildew fungus develops a feeding structure named the haustorium in the invaded host cell. Concomitant with haustorial biogenesis, the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) is formed to separate the haustorium from the host cell cytoplasm. The Arabidopsis resistance protein RPW8.2 is specifically targeted to the EHM where it activates haustorium-targeted resistance against powdery mildew. RPW8.2 belongs to a small family with six members in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Whether Homologs of RPW8 (HR) 1 to HR4 are also localized to the EHM and contribute to resistance has not been de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ed. Here, we report that overexpression of <i>HR1</i>, <i>HR2</i>, or <i>HR3</i> led to enhanced resistance to powdery mildew, while genetic depletion of <i>HR2</i> or <i>HR3</i> resulted in enhanced susceptibility, indicating that these <i>RPW8</i> homologs contribute to basal resistance. Interestingly, we found that N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ally YFP-tagged HR1 to HR3 are also EHM-localized. This suggests that EHM-targeting is an ancestral feature of the RPW8 family. Indeed, two RPW8 homologs from <i>Brassica oleracea</i> tested also exhibit EHM-localization. Domain swapping analysis between HR3 and RPW8.2 suggests that sequence diversification in the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al 146 amino acids of RPW8.2 probably functionally distinguishes it from other family members. Moreover, we found that N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ally YFP-tagged HR3 is also localized to the plasma membrane and the fungal penetration site (the papilla) in addition to the EHM. Using this unique feature of YFP-HR3, we obtained preliminary evidence to suggest that the EHM is unlikely derived from invagination of the plasma membrane, rather it may be mainly synthesized de novo.</p>

Plant-Specific Preprotein and Amino Acid Transporter Proteins Are Required for tRNA Import into Mitochondria
<p>A variety of eukaryotes, in particular plants, do not contain the required number of tRNAs to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> the translation of mitochondria-encoded genes and thus need to import tRNAs from the cytosol. This study identified two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) proteins, Tric1 and Tric2 (for tRNA import component), which on simultaneous inactivation by T-DNA insertion lines displayed a severely delayed and chlorotic growth phenotype and significantly reduced tRNA import capacity into isolated mitochondria. The predicted tRNA-binding domain of Tric1 and Tric2, a sterile-α-motif at the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al end of the protein, was required to restore tRNA uptake ability in mitochondria of complemented plants. The purified predicted tRNA-binding domain binds the T-arm of the tRNA for alanine with conserved lysine residues required for binding. T-DNA inactivation of both Tric proteins further resulted in an increase in the in vitro rate of in organello protein synthesis, which was mediated by a reorganization of the nuclear transcriptome, in particular of genes encoding a variety of proteins required for mitochondrial gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The characterization of Tric1/2 provides mechanistic insight into the process of tRNA import into mitochondria and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s the theory that the tRNA import pathway resulted from the repurposing of a preexisting protein import apparatus.</p>

Phosphorylation of GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 Alters Stimulation of Mg Chelatase Activity in Angiosperms
<p>GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 (GUN4) is a positive regulator of light-dependent chlorophyll biosynthesis. GUN4 activates Mg chelatase (MgCh) that catalyzes the insertion of an Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion into protoporphyrin IX. We show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GUN4 is phosphorylated at Ser 264 (S264), the penultimate amino acid residue at the C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>us. While GUN4 is preferentially phosphorylated in darkness, phosphorylation is reduced upon accumulation of Mg porphyrins. Expression of a phosphomimicking <i>GUN4</i>(S264D) results in an incomplete complementation of the white <i>gun4-2 null</i> mutant and a chlorotic phenotype comparable to <i>gun4</i> knockdown mutants. Phosphorylated GUN4 has a reduced stimulatory effect on MgCh in vitro and in vivo but retains its protein stability and tetrapyrrole binding capacity. Analysis of GUN4 found in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms reveals the evolution of a C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al extension, which harbors the phosphorylation site of GUN4 expressed in angiosperms. Homologs of GUN4 from <i>Synechocystis</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas</i> lack the conserved phosphorylation site found in a C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al extension of angiosperm GUN4. Biochemical studies proved the importance of the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al extension for MgCh stimulation and inactivation of GUN4 by phosphorylation in angiosperms. An additional mechanism regulating MgCh activity is proposed. In conjunction with the dark repression of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis, GUN4 phosphorylation minimizes the flow of intermediates into the Mg branch of the tetrapyrrole metabolic pathway for chlorophyll biosynthesis.</p>

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>e the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years.

Active repression by RARγ signaling is required for vertebrate axial elongation
<p>Retinoic acid receptor gamma 2 (RARγ2) is the major RAR isoform expressed throughout the caudal axial progenitor domain in vertebrates. During a microarray screen to identify RAR targets, we identified a subset of genes that pattern caudal structures or promote axial elongation and are upregulated by increased RAR-mediated repression. Previous studies have suggested that RAR is present in the caudal domain, but is quiescent until its activation in late stage embryos <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ates axial elongation. By contrast, we show here that RARγ2 is engaged in all stages of axial elongation, not solely as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ator of axial growth. In the absence of RA, RARγ2 represses transcriptional activity <i>in vivo</i> and maintains the pool of caudal progenitor cells and presomitic mesoderm. In the presence of RA, RARγ2 serves as an activator, facilitating somite differentiation. Treatment with an RARγ-selective inverse agonist (NRX205099) or overexpression of dominant-negative RARγ increases the expression of posterior Hox genes and that of marker genes for presomitic mesoderm and the chordoneural hinge. Conversely, when RAR-mediated repression is reduced by overexpressing a dominant-negative co-repressor (c-SMRT), a constitutively active RAR (VP16-RARγ2), or by treatment with an RARγ-selective agonist (NRX204647), expression of caudal genes is diminished and extension of the body axis is prematurely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ated. Hence, gene repression mediated by the unliganded RARγ2–co-repressor complex constitutes a novel mechanism to regulate and facilitate the correct expression levels and spatial restriction of key genes that maintain the caudal progenitor pool during axial elongation in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos.</p>

Non-specificity of Pitstop 2 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis
<p>Small molecule inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis are highly desired for the dissection of membrane trafficking pathways in the lab and for potential use as anti-infectives in the clinic. One inhibition strategy is to prevent clathrin from contacting adaptor proteins so that clathrin-mediated endocytosis cannot occur. “Pitstop” compounds have been developed that block only one of the four functional interaction sites on the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain of clathrin heavy chain. Despite this limitation, Pitstop 2 causes profound inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study, we probed for non-specific activity of Pitstop 2 by examining its action in cells expressing clathrin heavy chain harbouring mutations in the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain interaction sites. We conclude that the inhibition observed with this compound is due to non-specificity, i.e. it causes inhibition away from its proposed mode of action. We recommend that these compounds be used with caution in cells and that they should not be used to conclude anything of the function of clathrin's N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain.</p>

Protoplast Swelling and Hypocotyl Growth Depend on Different Auxin Signaling Pathways
<p>Members of the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN (TIR1/AFB) family are known auxin receptors. To analyze the possible receptor function of AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1), an auxin receptor currently under debate, we performed different approaches. We performed a pharmacological approach using α-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (auxinole), α-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-acetic acid (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We used a peptide of the carboxyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of <i>ABP1</i>, <i>abp1-c1</i> and <i>abp1-TD1</i>, and the TILLING mutant <i>abp1-5</i>. We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino acid exchange in the auxin-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl growth, both at high temporal resolution. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast swelling; instead, it showed auxin activity in the hypocotyl growth test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an auxin-like swelling response but no hypocotyl growth. The carboxyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al peptide of AtABP1 induced an auxin-like swelling response. In the <i>ABP1</i>-related mutants and Coimbra, no auxin-induced protoplast swelling occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid auxin-induced protoplast swelling, but it is not involved in the control of rapid auxin-induced growth.</p>

A Conifer UDP-Sugar Dependent Glycosyltransferase Contributes to Acetophenone Metabolism and Defense against Insects
<p>Acetophenones are phenolic compounds involved in the resistance of white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>) against spruce budworm (<i>Choristoneura fumiferiana</i>), a major forest pest in North America. The acetophenones pungenol and piceol commonly accumulate in spruce foliage in the form of the corresponding glycosides, pungenin and picein. These glycosides appear to be inactive against the insect but can be cleaved by a spruce β-glucosidase, PgβGLU-1, which releases the active aglycons. The reverse glycosylation reaction was hypothesized to involve a family 1 UDP-sugar dependent glycosyltransferase (UGT) to facilitate acetophenone accumulation in the plant. Metabolite and transcriptome profiling over a developmental time course of white spruce bud burst and shoot growth revealed two UGTs, PgUGT5 and PgUGT5b, that glycosylate pungenol. Recombinant PgUGT5b enzyme produced mostly pungenin, while PgUGT5 produced mostly isopungenin. Both UGTs also were active in vitro on select flavonoids. However, the context of transcript and metabolite accumulation did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> a biological role in flavonoid metabolism but correlated with the formation of pungenin in growing shoots. Transcript levels of <i>PgUGT5b</i> were higher than those of <i>PgUGT5</i> in needles across different genotypes of white spruce.

MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O Function in Pollen Tube Reception Is Linked to Its Oligomerization and Subcellular Distribution
<p>Sexual reproduction in flowering plants requires communication between synergid cells and a tip-elongating pollen tube (PT) for the successful delivery of sperm cells to the embryo sac. The reception of the PT relies on signaling within the synergid cell that ultimately leads to the degeneration of the receptive synergid and PT rupture, releasing the sperm cells for double fertilization. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), NORTIA, a member of the MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O (MLO) family of proteins, plays a critical role in the communication processes regulating PT reception. In this study, we de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ed that MLO function in PT reception is dependent on MLO protein localization into a Golgi-associated compartment before PT arrival, indicating that PT-triggered regulation of the synergid secretory system is important for synergid function during pollination.

Expression of the <i>BcXYG1</i> gene was strongly induced during the first 12 h post inoculation, and analysis of disease dynamics using PathTrack showed that a <i>B. cinerea</i> strain overexpressing <i>BcXYG1</i> produced early local necrosis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing a role of BcXYG1 as an early cell death-inducing factor. The xyloglucanase activity of BcXYG1 was not necessary for the induction of necrosis and plant resistance, as a mutant of BcXYG1 lacking the xyloglucanase enzymatic activity retained both functions. Residues in two exposed loops on the surface of BcXYG1 were found to be necessary for the induction of cell death but not to induce plant resistance. Further analyses showed that BcXYG1 is apoplastic and possibly interacts with the proteins of the plant cell membrane and also that the BcXYG1 cell death-promoting signal is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases BAK1 and SOBIR1. Our findings <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> the role of cell death-inducing proteins in establishing the infection of necrotrophic pathogens and highlight the recognition of fungal apoplastic proteins by the plant immune system as an important mechanism of resistance against this class of pathogens.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> respiration. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark respiration. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of respiration and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the respiration.</p>

The Enzyme Activity and Substrate Specificity of Two Major Cinnamyl Alcohol Dehydrogenases in Sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), SbCAD2 and SbCAD4
<p>Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) catalyzes the final step in monolignol biosynthesis, reducing sinapaldehyde, coniferaldehyde, and <i>p</i>-coumaraldehyde to their corresponding alcohols in an NADPH-dependent manner. Because of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al location in monolignol biosynthesis, the variation in substrate specificity and activity of CAD can result in significant changes in overall composition and amount of lignin. Our in-depth characterization of two major CAD isoforms, SbCAD2 (Brown midrib 6 [bmr6]) and SbCAD4, in lignifying tissues of sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for generating renewable chemicals and fuels, indicates their similarity in both structure and activity to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CAD5 and <i>Populus tremuloides</i> sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively. This first crystal structure of a monocot CAD combined with enzyme kinetic data and a catalytic model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ed by site-directed mutagenesis allows full comparison with dicot CADs and elucidates the potential signature sequence for their substrate specificity and activity. The L119W/G301F-SbCAD4 double mutant displayed its substrate preference in the order coniferaldehyde > <i>p</i>-coumaraldehyde > sinapaldehyde, with higher catalytic efficiency than that of both wild-type SbCAD4 and SbCAD2. As SbCAD4 is the only major CAD isoform in <i>bmr6</i> mutants, replacing SbCAD4 with L119W/G301F-SbCAD4 in <i>bmr6</i> plants could produce a phenotype that is more amenable to biomass processing.</p>

ROOT DETERMINED NODULATION1 Is Required for <i>M. truncatula</i> CLE12, But Not CLE13, Peptide Signaling through the SUNN Receptor Kinase
<p>The combinatorial interaction of a receptor kinase and a modified CLE peptide is involved in several developmental processes in plants, including autoregulation of nodulation (AON), which allows legumes to limit the number of root nodules formed based on available nitrogen and previous rhizobial colonization. Evidence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s the modification of CLE peptides by enzymes of the hydroxyproline <i>O</i>-arabinosyltransferase (HPAT/RDN) family. Here, we show by grafting and genetic analysis in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> that, in the AON pathway, RDN1, functioning in the root, acts upstream of the receptor kinase SUNN, functioning in the shoot. As expected for a glycosyltransferase, we found that RDN1 and RDN2 proteins are localized to the Golgi, as was shown previously for AtHPAT1. Using composite plants with transgenic hairy roots, we show that <i>RDN1</i> and <i>RDN2</i> orthologs from dicots as well as a related <i>RDN</i> gene from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) can rescue the phenotype of <i>rdn1-2</i> when expressed constitutively, but the less related <i>MtRDN3</i> cannot. The timing of the induction of <i>MtCLE12</i> and <i>MtCLE13</i> peptide genes (negative regulators of AON) in nodulating roots is not altered by the mutation of <i>RDN1</i> or <i>SUNN</i>, although expression levels are higher. Plants with transgenic roots constitutively expressing <i>MtCLE12</i> require both RDN1 and SUNN to prevent nodule formation, while plants constitutively expressing <i>MtCLE13</i> require only SUNN, suggesting that the two CLEs have different requirements for function. Combined with previous work, these data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> a model in which RDN1 arabinosylates MtCLE12, and this modification is necessary for the transport and/or reception of the AON signal by the SUNN kinase.</p>

In Vitro Characterization of Thermostable CAM Rubisco Activase Reveals a Rubisco Interacting Surface Loop
<p>To maintain metabolic flux through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in higher plants, dead-end inhibited complexes of Rubisco must constantly be engaged and remodeled by the molecular chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca). In C3 plants, the thermolability of Rca is responsible for the deactivation of Rubisco and reduction of photosynthesis at moderately elevated temperatures. We reasoned that crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants must possess thermostable Rca to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle flux during the day when stomata are closed. A comparative biochemical characterization of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Agave tequilana</i> Rca isoforms demonstrated that the CAM Rca isoforms are approximately10°C more thermostable than the C3 isoforms. Agave Rca also possessed a much higher in vitro biochemical activity, even at low assay temperatures. Mixtures of rice and agave Rca form functional hetero-oligomers in vitro, but only the rice isoforms denature at nonpermissive temperatures. The high thermostability and activity of agave Rca mapped to the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al 244 residues. A Glu-217-Gln amino acid substitution was found to confer high Rca activity to rice Rca. Further mutational analysis suggested that Glu-217 restricts the flexibility of the α4-β4 surface loop that interacts with Rubisco via Lys-216. CAM plants thus promise to be a source of highly functional, thermostable Rca candidates for thermal fortification of crop photosynthesis. Careful characterization of their properties will likely reveal further protein-protein interaction motifs to enrich our mechanistic model of Rca function.</p>

Origins and Evolution of Stomatal Development
<p>The fossil record suggests stomata-like pores were present on the surfaces of land plants over 400 million years ago. Whether stomata arose once or whether they arose independently across newly evolving land plant lineages has long been a matter of debate. In Arabidopsis, a genetic toolbox has been identified that tightly controls stomatal development and patterning. This includes the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors <i>SPEECHLESS</i> (<i>SPCH</i>), <i>MUTE</i>, <i>FAMA</i>, and <i>ICE/SCREAMs</i> (<i>SCRMs</i>), which promote stomatal formation. These factors are regulated via a signaling cascade, which includes mobile <i>EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR</i> (<i>EPF</i>) peptides to enforce stomatal spacing. Mosses and hornworts, the most ancient extant lineages to possess stomata, possess orthologs of these Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomatal toolbox genes, and manipulation in the model bryophyte <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> has shown that the bHLH and EPF components are also required for moss stomatal development and patterning. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s an ancient and tightly conserved genetic origin of stomata. Here, we review recent discoveries and, by interrogating newly available plant genomes, we advance the story of stomatal development and patterning across land plant evolution. Furthermore, we identify potential orthologs of the key toolbox genes in a hornwort, further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing a single ancient genetic origin of stomata in the ancestor to all stomatous land plants.</p>

pTAC10, a Key Subunit of Plastid-Encoded RNA Polymerase, Promotes Chloroplast Development
<p>Regulation of photosynthetic gene expression by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) is essential for chloroplast development. The activity of PEP largely relies on at least 12 PEP-associated proteins (PAPs) encoded in the nuclear genome of plant cells. A recent model proposed that these PAPs regulate the establishment of the PEP complex through broad PAP-PEP or PAP-PAP interactions. In this study, we identified the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedling-lethal mutant <i>ptac10-1</i>, which has defects in chloroplast development, and found that the mutant phenotype is caused by the suppression of <i>PLASTID S1 RNA-BINDING DOMAIN PROTEIN</i> (<i>pTAC10/PAP3</i>). Analysis of the heterozygous mutant and <i>pTAC10</i>-overexpressing transgenic plants indicated that the expression level of <i>pTAC10</i> is tightly linked to chloroplast development. Characterization of the interaction of pTAC10 with PAPs revealed that pTAC10 interacts with other PAPs, such as FSD2, FSD3, TrxZ, pTAC7, and pTAC14, but it does not interact with PEP core enzymes, such as rpoA and rpoB. Analysis of pTAC10 interactions using truncated pTAC10 proteins showed that the pTAC10 carboxyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region downstream of the S1 domain is involved in the pTAC10-PAP interaction. Furthermore, overexpression of truncated <i>pTAC10s</i> lacking the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al regions downstream of the S1 domain could not rescue the <i>ptac10-1</i> mutant phenotype and induced an abnormal whitening phenotype in Columbia-0 plants. Our observations suggested that these pTAC10-PAP interactions are essential for the formation of the PEP complex and chloroplast development.</p>

Mechanism of Dual Targeting of the Phytochrome Signaling Component HEMERA/pTAC12 to Plastids and the Nucleus
<p>HEMERA (HMR) is a nuclear and plastidial dual-targeted protein. While it functions in the nucleus as a transcriptional coactivator in phytochrome signaling to regulate a distinct set of light-responsive, growth-relevant genes, in plastids it is known as pTAC12, which associates with the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase, and is essential for inducing the plastomic photosynthetic genes and initiating chloroplast biogenesis. However, the mechanism of targeting HMR to the nucleus and plastids is still poorly understood. Here, we show that HMR can be directly imported into chloroplasts through a transit peptide residing in the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al 50 amino acids. Upon cleavage of the transit peptide and additional proteolytic processing, mature HMR, which begins from Lys-58, retains its biochemical properties in phytochrome signaling. Unexpectedly, expression of mature HMR failed to rescue not only the plastidial but also the nuclear defects of the <i>hmr</i> mutant. This is because the predicted nuclear localization signals of HMR are nonfunctional, and therefore mature HMR is unable to accumulate in either plastids or the nucleus. Surprisingly, fusing the transit peptide of the small subunit of Rubisco with mature HMR rescues both its plastidial and nuclear localization and functions. These results, combined with the observation that the nuclear form of HMR has the same reduced molecular mass as plastidial HMR, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> a retrograde protein translocation mechanism in which HMR is targeted first to plastids, processed to the mature form, and then relocated to the nucleus.</p>

An E3 Ligase Affects the NLR Receptor Stability and Immunity to Powdery Mildew
<p>Following the detection of pathogen cognate effectors, plant Nod-like receptors (NLRs) trigger isolate-specific immunity that is generally associated with cell death. The regulation of NLR stability is important to ensure effective immunity. In barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the allelic Mildew locus A (MLA) receptors mediate isolate-specific disease resistance against powdery mildew fungus (<i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>). Currently, how MLA stability is controlled remains unknown. Here, we identified an MLA-interacting RING-type E3 ligase, MIR1, that interacts with several MLAs. We showed that the carboxyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al TPR domain of MIR1 mediates the interaction with the coiled-coil domain-containing region of functional MLAs, such as MLA1, MLA6, and MLA10, but not with that of the nonfunctional MLA18-1. MIR1 can ubiquitinate the amino-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of MLAs in vitro and promotes the proteasomal degradation of MLAs in vitro and in planta. Both proteasome inhibitor treatment and virus-induced gene silencing-mediated <i>MIR1</i> silencing significantly increased MLA abundance in barley transgenic lines. Furthermore, overexpression of MIR1 specifically compromised MLA-mediated disease resistance in barley, while coexpression of MIR1 and MLA10 attenuated MLA10-induced cell death signaling in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Together, our data reveal a mechanism for the control of the stability of MLA immune receptors and for the attenuation of MLA-triggered defense signaling by a RING-type E3 ligase via the ubiquitin proteasome system.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6
<p>Dirigent proteins impart stereoselectivity to phenoxy radical coupling reactions in plants and, thus, play an essential role in the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products. This includes the regioselective and enantioselective coupling and subsequent cyclization of two coniferyl alcohol radicals to pinoresinol as the committed step of lignan biosynthesis. The reaction is controlled by dirigent proteins, which, depending on the species and protein, direct the reaction to either (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol. We present the crystal structure of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å resolution. The structure shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-separated cavities for substrate binding. The binding cavities are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The structure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s a model in which two substrate radicals bind to each of the DIR monomers. With the aromatic rings fixed in the two pockets, the propionyl side chains face each other for radical-radical coupling, and stereoselectivity is de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ed by the exact positioning of the side chains. Extensive mutational analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s a previously unrecognized function for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclization of the bis-quinone methide reaction intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

The Proteasome Acts as a Hub for Plant Immunity and Is Targeted by <i>Pseudomonas</i> Type III Effectors
<p>Recent evidence suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in several aspects of plant immunity and that a range of plant pathogens subvert the ubiquitin-proteasome system to enhance their virulence. Here, we show that proteasome activity is strongly induced during basal defense in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Mutant lines of the proteasome subunits <i>RPT2a</i> and <i>RPN12a</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> increased bacterial growth of virulent <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 (<i>Pst</i>) and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> ES4326. Both proteasome subunits are required for pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity responses. Analysis of bacterial growth after a secondary infection of systemic leaves revealed that the establishment of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is impaired in proteasome mutants, suggesting that the proteasome also plays an important role in defense priming and SAR. In addition, we show that <i>Pst</i> inhibits proteasome activity in a type III secretion-dependent manner. A screen for type III effector proteins from <i>Pst</i> for their ability to interfere with proteasome activity revealed HopM1, HopAO1, HopA1, and HopG1 as putative proteasome inhibitors. Biochemical characterization of HopM1 by mass spectrometry indicates that HopM1 interacts with several E3 ubiquitin ligases and proteasome subunits. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s the hypothesis that HopM1 associates with the proteasome, leading to its inhibition. Thus, the proteasome is an essential component of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity and SAR, which is targeted by multiple bacterial effectors.</p>

Cis-Regulatory Evolution of Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1), a Terminal Selector Gene for Decidual Stromal Cell Identity
<p>Studies in human and mouse have shown that decidual stromal cells (DSC), which develop in the innermost lining of uterus, mediate placentation by regulating maternal immune response against the fetus and the extent of fetal invasion. Investigating when and how DSC evolved is thus a key step to reconstructing the evolutionary history of mammalian pregnancy. We present molecular evidence placing the origin of DSC in the stem lineage of eutherians (extant placental mammals). The transcription factor forkhead box O1 (<i>FOXO1</i>) is a part of the core regulatory transcription factor complex (CoRC) that establishes the cell type identity of DSC. Decidualization, the process through which DSC differentiate from endometrial stromal fibroblasts, requires transcriptional upregulation of <i>FOXO1</i>. Contrary to other examples in mammals where gene recruitment is caused by the origin of an alternative promoter, FOXO1 is transcribed from the same promoter in DSC as in endometrial stromal fibroblasts. Comparing the activities of <i>FOXO1</i> promoters from human, mouse, manatee (Afrotheria), and opossum (marsupial) revealed that <i>FOXO1</i> promoter evolved responsiveness to decidualization signals in the stem lineage of eutherians. This eutherian vs. marsupial pattern of promoter activity was not observed in some other cell types expressing <i>FOXO1</i>, suggesting that this cis-regulatory evolution occurred specifically in the context of the origin of DSC. Sequence comparison revealed eutherian-specifically conserved nucleotides that contribute to the eutherian promoter activity. We conclude that the cis-regulatory activity of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al selector gene for decidual stromal cell identity evolved in the stem lineage of eutherians <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing a model where decidual cells are a eutherian innovation.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been measured previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either direction. The influx technique with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

Contribution of neural cell death to depressive phenotypes of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice
<p>Major depression disorder (MDD) or depression is highly prevalent in individuals with diabetes, and the depressive symptoms are more severe and less responsive to antidepressant therapies in these patients. The underlying mechanism is little understood. We hypothesized that the pathophysiology of comorbid depression was more complex than that proposed for MDD and that neural cell death played a role in the disease severity. To test this hypothesis, we generated streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. These mice had blood glucose levels threefold above controls and exhibited depressive phenotypes as judged by a battery of behavioral tests, thus confirming the comorbidity in mice. Immunohistological studies showed markedly increased TUNEL-positive cells in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the comorbid mice, indicating apoptosis. This finding was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ed by increased caspase-3 and decreased Bcl-2 proteins in these brain regions. In addition, the serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level of comorbid mice was reduced compared with controls, further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing the neurodegenerative change. Mechanistic analyses showed an increased expression of mitochondrial fission genes fission protein 1 (<i>Fis1</i>) and dynamin-related protein 1 (<i>Drp1</i>), and a decreased expression of mitochondrial fusion genes mitofusin 1 (<i>Mfn1</i>), mitofusin 2 (<i>Mfn2</i>) and optical atrophy 1 (<i>Opa1</i>). Representative assessment of the proteins Drp1 and Mfn2 mirrored the mRNA changes. The data demonstrated that neural cell death was associated with the depressive phenotype of comorbid mice and that a fission-dominant expression of genes and proteins mediating mitochondrial dynamics played a role in the hyperglycemia-induced cell death. The study provides new insight into the disease mechanism and could aid the development of novel therapeutics aimed at providing neuroprotection by modulating mitochondrial dynamics to treat comorbid depression with diabetes.</p>

<p>Hearing loss is frequent in intensive care patients and can be due to several causes. However, sepsis has not been examined as a possible cause. The aim of this study is to assess the influence of experimental sepsis on hearing thresholds and to evaluate pathological changes in the cochlea. The cecal ligation puncture technique was used to induce sepsis in 18 mice. Results were compared with those from 13 sham-operated and 13 untreated control mice. The hearing thresholds of the animals were evaluated with auditory evoked brainstem responses prior to the induction of sepsis and again at the peak of the disease. Immediately after the second measurement, the mice were sacrificed and the inner ears harvested and prepared for further evaluation. The cochleae were examined with light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry for Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2. The mice with sepsis showed a significant hearing loss but not the control groups. Induction of apoptosis could be shown in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing cells of the organ of Corti. Furthermore, excitotoxicity could be shown at the basal pole of the inner hair cells. In this murine model, sepsis leads to significant hearing impairment. The physiological alteration could be linked to apoptosis in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing cells of the organ of Corti and to a disturbance of the synapses of the inner hair cells.</p>

FGF controls epithelial-mesenchymal transitions during gastrulation by regulating cell division and apicobasal polarity
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> FGF regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition in mesoderm to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> collective movement at gastrulation and also the reverse, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, during which cells acquire apicobasal polarity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> their differentiation into diverse muscle types.</p>

Extrinsic and intrinsic control by EKLF (KLF1) within a specialized erythroid niche
<p>The erythroblastic island provides an important nutritional and survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> niche for efficient erythropoietic differentiation. Island integrity is reliant on adhesive interactions between erythroid and macrophage cells. We show that erythroblastic islands can be formed from single progenitor cells present in differentiating embryoid bodies, and that these correspond to erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) that first appear in the yolk sac of the early developing embryo. Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF; KLF1), a crucial zinc finger transcription factor, is expressed in the EMPs, and plays an extrinsic role in erythroid maturation by being expressed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ive macrophage of the erythroblastic island and regulating relevant genes important for island integrity within these cells. Together with its well-established intrinsic contributions to erythropoiesis, EKLF thus plays a coordinating role between two different cell types whose interaction provides the optimal environment to generate a mature red blood cell.</p>

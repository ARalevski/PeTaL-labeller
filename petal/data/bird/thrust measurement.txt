Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   alignment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es during static and dynamic weight-bearing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es and moments were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in nine   patients with instrumented knee implants. Medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratios were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend). Hip-knee-ankle angles in the frontal plane were analysed   using full-leg coronal radiographs. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratio strongly correlated with the tibiofemoral   alignment in the static condition of one-legged stance (R² = 0.88)   and dynamic single-limb loading (R² = 0.59) with varus malalignment   leading to increased medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratios of up to 88%. In contrast,   the correlation between leg alignment and magnitude of medial compartment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e   was much less pronounced. A lateral shift of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e occurred during   activities with double-limb support and higher knee flexion angles. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratio depends on both the tibiofemoral alignment   and the nature of the activity involved. It cannot be generalised   to a single value. Higher medial ratios during single-limb loading   are associated with varus malalignment in TKA. The current trend   towards a ‘constitutional varus’ after joint replacement, in terms   of overall tibiofemoral alignment, should be considered carefully   with respect to the increased medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratio.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:779–87.</p></sec>

Profiling the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force in B cell activation
<p>B lymphocytes use B cell receptors (BCRs) to recognize membrane-bound antigens to further initiate cell spreading and contraction responses during B cell activation. We combined traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e microscopy and live-cell imaging to profile the origin, dynamics, and function of traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation in these responses. We showed that B cell activation required the generation of 10 to 20 nN of traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e when encountering antigens presented by substrates with stiffness values from 0.5 to 1 kPa, which mimic the rigidity of antigen-presenting cells in vivo. Perturbation experiments revealed that F-actin remodeling and myosin- and dynein-mediated contractility contributed to traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation and B cell activation. Moreover, membrane-proximal BCR signaling molecules (including Lyn, Syk, Btk, PLC-γ2, BLNK, and Vav3) and adaptor molecules (Grb2, Cbl, and Dok-3) linking BCR microclusters and motor proteins were also required for the sustained generation of these traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es. We found a positive correlation between the strength of the traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e and the mean fluorescence intensity of the BCR microclusters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that isotype-switched memory B cells expressing immunoglobulin G (IgG)–BCRs generated greater traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es than did mature naive B cells expressing IgM-BCRs during B cell activation. Last, we observed that primary B cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis generated greater traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es than did B cells from healthy donors in response to antigen stimulation. Together, these data delineate the origin, dynamics, and function of traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e during B cell activation.</p>

Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e air samples from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with samples from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sensors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement proved to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field samples (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable sensors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the sensors’ methods enable accurate ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used different definitions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for misinterpretation of the   results. We compared the reliability and accuracy of five current   methods using plain radiographs (those of Lewinnek, Widmer, Liaw,   Pradhan, and Woo and Morrey) with CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements, using the same   definition and reference plane. We retrospectively studied the plain   radiographs and CT scans in 84 hips of 84 patients who underwent   primary THR.

Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p>Cell motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and cancer cell invasion. It is generally thought that migrating cells grab and exert traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e onto the extracellular matrix in order to pull the cell body forward. While previous studies have shown that myosin II deficient cells migrate efficiently, whether these cells exert traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es during cell migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e sensor and shRNA specific to each myosin II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how myosin IIA and IIB individually regulate cell migration and traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation. Myosin IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual myosin II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, myosin IIA deficient cells lost actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas myosin IIB deficient cells maintained similar actin organization and focal adhesions as wild-type cells. Interestingly, myosin IIA deficient cells migrated faster than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet myosin IIA deficient cells exerted significantly less traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e at the leading edge than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells. These results suggest that, in the absence of myosin IIA mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-generating machinery, cells move with minimal traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es at the cell periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of cells to adapt and migrate.</p>

Measurement of a superconducting qubit with a microwave photon counter
<p>Fast, high-fidelity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement is a key ingredient for quantum error correction. Conventional approaches to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement of superconducting qubits, involving linear amplification of a microwave probe tone followed by heterodyne detection at room temperature, do not scale well to large system sizes. We introduce an approach to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement based on a microwave photon counter demonstrating raw single-shot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement fidelity of 92%. Moreover, the intrinsic damping of the photon counter is used to extract the energy released by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement process, allowing repeated high-fidelity quantum nondemolition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements. Our scheme provides access to the classical outcome of projective quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement at the millikelvin stage and could form the basis for a scalable quantum-to-classical interface.</p>

The functional role of caudal and anal/dorsal fins during the C-start of a bluegill sunfish
<p>Fast starts are crucial in the survival of aquatic swimmers to capture prey or avoid predators. Currently, it is widely accepted that during C-starts: (1) the caudal fin generates a considerable hydrodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e; and (2) anal/dorsal fins are erected to significantly increase the hydrodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e. In this work, the above hypotheses on the role of fins during C-starts are studied using experimentally guided numerical simulations of four bluegill sunfish, whose fins are removed or erected. The amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e created by the body and fins at each time instant was not constant and varied during the C-start. Nevertheless, in agreement with hypothesis (1), up to 70% of the instantaneous hydrodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was generated by the tail during Stage 2 of the C-start, when the sunfish rapidly bends out of the C-shape. Additionally, the contribution in Stage 1, when the sunfish bends into a C-shape, is less than 20% at each instant. Most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e in Stage 1 was produced by the body of the sunfish. In contrast to hypothesis (2), the effect of erection/removal of the fins was less than 5% of the instantaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e in both Stages 1 and 2, except for a short period of time (2 ms) just before Stage 2. However, it is known that the anal/dorsal fins are actively controlled during the C-start from muscle activity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements. Based on the results presented here, it is suggested that the active control of the anal/dorsal fins can be related to retaining the stability of the sunfish against roll and pitch movements during the C-start. Furthermore, the erection of the fins increases the moment of inertia to make the roll and pitch movements more difficult.</p>

Quantum correlations from a room-temperature optomechanical cavity
<p>The act of position <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement alters the motion of an object being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed. This quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement backaction is typically much smaller than the thermal motion of a room-temperature object and thus difficult to observe. By shining laser light through a nanomechanical beam, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the beam’s thermally driven vibrations and perturb its motion with optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e fluctuations at a level dictated by the Heisenberg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement-disturbance uncertainty relation. We demonstrate a cross-correlation technique to distinguish optically driven motion from thermally driven motion, observing this quantum backaction signature up to room temperature. We use the scale of the quantum correlations, which is determined by fundamental constants, to gauge the size of thermal motion, demonstrating a path toward absolute thermometry with quantum mechanically calibrated ticks.</p>

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. Photosynthesis transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed. Reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net photosynthesis, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

Spatial entanglement patterns and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in Bose-Einstein condensates
<p>Many-particle entanglement is a fundamental concept of quantum physics that still presents conceptual challenges. Although nonclassical states of atomic ensembles were used to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement precision in quantum metrology, the notion of entanglement in these systems was debated because the correlations among the indistinguishable atoms were witnessed by collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements only. Here, we use high-resolution imaging to directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the spin correlations between spatially separated parts of a spin-squeezed Bose-Einstein condensate. We observe entanglement that is strong enough for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering: We can predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement outcomes for noncommuting observables in one spatial region on the basis of corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements in another region with an inferred uncertainty product below the Heisenberg uncertainty bound. This method could be exploited for entanglement-enhanced imaging of electromagnetic field distributions and quantum information tasks.</p>

Molecular mechanism of extreme mechanostability in a pathogen adhesin
<p>High resilience to mechanical stress is key when pathogens adhere to their target and initiate infection. Using atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e microscopy–based single-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e spectroscopy, we explored the mechanical stability of the prototypical staphylococcal adhesin SdrG, which targets a short peptide from human fibrinogen β. Steered molecular dynamics simulations revealed, and single-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e spectroscopy experiments confirmed, the mechanism by which this complex withstands <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es of over 2 nanonewtons, a regime previously associated with the strength of a covalent bond. The target peptide, confined in a screwlike manner in the binding pocket of SdrG, distributes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es mainly toward the peptide backbone through an intricate hydrogen bond network. Thus, these adhesins can attach to their target with exceptionally resilient mechanostability, virtually independent of peptide side chains.</p>

Vinculin forms a directionally asymmetric catch bond with F-actin
<p>Vinculin is an actin-binding protein thought to rein<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. However, how mechanical load affects the vinculin–F-actin bond is unclear. Using a single-molecule optical trap assay, we found that vinculin forms a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-dependent catch bond with F-actin through its tail domain, but with lifetimes that depend strongly on the direction of the applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e toward the pointed (–) end of the actin filament resulted in a bond that was maximally stable at 8 piconewtons, with a mean lifetime (12 seconds) 10 times as long as the mean lifetime when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was applied toward the barbed (+) end. A computational model of lamellipodial actin dynamics suggests that the directionality of the vinculin–F-actin bond could establish long-range order in the actin cytoskeleton. The directional and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-stabilized binding of vinculin to F-actin may be a mechanism by which adhesion complexes maintain front-rear asymmetry in migrating cells.</p>

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals dispersion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight control. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Lateral radiographs   and CT scans were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later. The anteversion of the acetabular component was   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed using the method described by Woo and Morrey and the ischiolateral   method described by Pulos et al and these were compared with the   results obtained from CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean anteversion was 18.35° (3° to 38°) using Woo and Morrey’s   method, 51.45° (30° to 85°) using the ischiolateral method and 21.22°   (2° to 48°) using CT scans. The Pearson correlation coefficient   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method. There was a linear correlation between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements   using the ischiolateral method and those using CT scans.

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults

We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of diastolic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for diastolic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-based cut points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal diastolic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal diastolic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign.

Partitioning of vessel resistivity in three liana species
<p>Vessels with simple perforation plates, found in the majority of angiosperms, are considered the evolutionarily most advanced conduits, least impeding the xylem sap flow. Nevertheless, when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed, their hydraulic resistivity (<i>R</i>, i.e., inverse value of hydraulic conductivity) is significantly higher than resistivity predicted using Hagen–Poiseuille equation (<i>R</i><sub>HP</sub>). In our study we aimed (i) to quantify two basic components of the total vessel resistivity – vessel lumen resistivity and end wall resistivity, and (ii) to analyze how the variable inner diameter of the vessel along its longitudinal axis affects resistivity. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed flow rates through progressively shortened stems of hop (<i>Humulus lupulus</i> L.), grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), and clematis (<i>Clematis vitalba</i> L.) and used elastomer injection for identification of open vessels and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement of changing vessel inner diameters along its axis. The relative contribution of end wall resistivity to total vessel resistivity was 0.46 for hop, 0.55 for grapevine, and 0.30 for clematis. Vessel lumen resistivity calculated from our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements was substantially higher than theoretical resistivity – about 43% for hop, 58% for grapevine, and 52% for clematis. We identified variation in the vessel inner diameter as an important source of vessel resistivity. The coefficient of variation of vessel inner diameter was a good predictor for the increase of the ratio of integral <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> calculated from the mean value of inner vessel diameter. We discuss the fact that we dealt with the longest vessels in a given stem sample, which may lead to the overestimation of vessel lumen resistivity, which consequently precludes decision whether the variable vessel inner diameter explains fully the difference between vessel lumen resistivity and <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> we observed.</p>

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite sensitive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in zoological settings, rein<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>ing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Variation in functional pelvic tilt in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The pelvis rotates in the sagittal plane during daily activities.   These rotations have a direct effect on the functional orientation   of the acetabulum. The aim of this study was to quantify changes   in pelvic tilt between different functional positions.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Pre-operatively, pelvic tilt was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in 1517 patients undergoing   total hip arthroplasty (THA) in three functional positions – supine,   standing and flexed seated (the moment when patients initiate rising   from a seated position). Supine pelvic tilt was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed from CT   scans, standing and flexed seated pelvic tilts were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed from standardised   lateral radiographs. Anterior pelvic tilt was assigned a positive   value.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean pelvic tilt was 4.2° (-20.5° to 24.5°), -1.3° (-30.2°   to 27.9°) and 0.6° (-42.0° to 41.3°) in the three positions, respectively.   The mean sagittal pelvic rotation from supine to standing was -5.5°   (-21.8° to 8.4°), from supine to flexed seated was -3.7° (-48.3°   to 38.6°) and from standing to flexed seated was 1.8° (-51.8° to   39.5°). In 259 patients (17%), the extent of sagittal pelvic rotation   could lead to functional malorientation of the acetabular component.

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital volume is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission volume, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case volume, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es were (1) process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study these associations with hospital volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-volume hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es than higher-volume hospitals. Higher hospital volume was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher volumes with lower 6-month mortality (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective national quality improvement registry of older patients with HF indicates that hospital volume as a structural metric correlates with process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up. Hospital profiling should focus on participation in systems of care, adherence to process metrics, and risk-standardized outcomes rather than on hospital volume itself.</p></sec>

High-Density Lipoprotein Subspecies Defined by Presence of Apolipoprotein C-III and Incident Coronary Heart Disease in Four Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The causal role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in cardioprotection has been questioned by genetic and randomized studies. Novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es that relate to HDL function may contribute new information to the prediction of cardiovascular risk. Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is a key regulator of lipoprotein metabolism. We investigated whether subspecies of HDL defined by apoC-III are associated with coronary heart disease (CHD).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used immunoaffinity chromatography to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the apoA-I concentrations of HDL that contains and lacks apoC-III in 2 prospective studies of adults free of CHD. In MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), 5657 participants (52% women, 52–72 years of age) were followed for risk of CHD from 2000 to 2002 through 2013. In a case-cohort study nested within the DCH study (Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health), 3642 participants (47% women, 51–64 years of age) were followed from 1994 to 1997 through 2010. Subsequently, we conducted a meta-analysis that combined these results with the previously published findings from 2 cohort studies that used similar laboratory methodology to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e lipoproteins, totaling 2997 incident cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>ApoC-III was found on 6% to 8% of apoA-I. The 2 HDL subspecies showed opposing associations, with risk of CHD in each of the individual cohorts and in the meta-analysis (<i>P</i> heterogeneity between the 2 subspecies <0.01). HDL that contains apoC-III was associated with a higher risk of CHD (pooled relative risk per standard deviation, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.18), whereas HDL that lacks apoC-III was associated with lower risk (relative risk, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.83). The relative risk for HDL lacking apoC-III was even more negative than the relative risk for total HDL (relative risk, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.87).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings from 4 prospective studies support the hypothesis that apoC-III may mark a subfraction of HDL that is associated with higher risk of CHD. New <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es reflecting HDL structure and function may provide novel insights for cardiovascular risk that extend beyond traditional plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations.</p></sec>

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based risk factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates adult lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es. We assessed and compared the utility of a risk model based solely on nonlaboratory risk factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory risk factors plus lipids for predicting high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study) and followed into adulthood when cIMT was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed (mean follow-up, 23.4 years). Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-risk plasma lipid levels were defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Cholesterol Levels in Children. High cIMT was defined as a study-specific value ≥90th percentile. Age and sex were included in each model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In univariate models, all risk factors except for borderline high and high triglycerides in adolescence were associated with high cIMT in adulthood. In multivariable models (relative risk [95% confidence interval]), male sex (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) remained significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05). The addition of lipids into the nonlaboratory risk model slightly but significantly improved discrimination in predicting high cIMT compared with nonlaboratory-based risk factors only (C statistics for laboratory-based model 0.717 [95% confidence interval, 0.685–0.748] and for nonlaboratory 0.698 [95% confidence interval, 0.667–0.731]; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Nonlaboratory-based risk factors and lipids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in adolescence independently predicted preclinical atherosclerosis in young adulthood. The addition of lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements to traditional clinic-based risk factor assessment provided a statistically significant but clinically modest improvement on adolescent prediction of high cIMT in adulthood.</p></sec>

Exploring Coronary Circulatory Response to Stenosis and Its Association With Invasive Physiologic Indexes Using Absolute Myocardial Blood Flow and Coronary Pressure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although invasive physiological assessment for coronary stenosis has become a standard practice to guide treatment strategy, coronary circulatory response and changes in invasive physiological indexes, according to different anatomic and hemodynamic lesion severity, have not been fully demonstrated in patients with coronary artery disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred fifteen patients with left anterior descending artery stenosis who underwent both <sup>13</sup>N-ammonia positron emission tomography and invasive physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement were analyzed. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with positron emission tomography and invasively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed coronary pressures were used to calculate microvascular resistance and stenosis resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>With progressive worsening of angiographic stenosis severity, both resting and hyperemic transstenotic pressure gradient and stenosis resistance increased (<i>P</i><0.001 for all) and hyperemic MBF (<i>P</i><0.001) and resting microvascular resistance (<i>P</i>=0.012) decreased. Resting MBF (<i>P</i>=0.383) and hyperemic microvascular resistance (<i>P</i>=0.431) were not changed and maintained stable. Both fractional flow reserve and instantaneous wave-free ratio decreased as angiographic stenosis severity, stenosis resistance, and transstenotic pressure gradient increased and hyperemic MBF decreased (all <i>P</i><0.001).

Prolonged, Uninterrupted Sedentary Behavior and Glycemic Biomarkers Among US Hispanic/Latino Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Excessive sedentary time is ubiquitous in developed nations and is associated with deleterious health outcomes. Few studies have examined whether the manner in which sedentary time is accrued (in short or long bouts) carries any clinical relevance. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of prolonged, uninterrupted sedentary behavior with glycemic biomarkers in a cohort of US Hispanic/Latino adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 12 083 participants from the HCHS/SOL (Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos), a population-based study of Hispanic/Latino adults 18 to 74 years of age. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and glycosylated hemoglobin were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed from a fasting blood sample, and 2-hour glucose was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed after an oral glucose tolerance test. Sedentary time was objectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with a hip-mounted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acceleromet</span></strong>er. Prolonged, uninterrupted sedentariness was expressed as mean sedentary bout length.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After adjustment for potential confounders and moderate to vigorous physical activity, longer sedentary bout duration was dose-dependently associated with increased homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (<i>P</i> for trend<0.001) and 2-hour glucose levels (<i>P</i> for trend=0.015). These associations were not independent of total sedentary time; however, a significant interaction between sedentary bout duration and total sedentary time was observed. Evaluation of the joint association of total sedentary time and sedentary bout duration showed that participants in the upper quartile for both sedentary characteristics (ie, high total sedentary time and high sedentary bout duration) had the highest levels of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (<i>P</i><0.001 versus low group for both sedentary characteristics) and 2-hour glucose (<i>P</i>=0.002 versus low group for both sedentary characteristics). High total sedentary time or high sedentary bout duration alone were not associated with differences in any glycemic biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Accruing sedentary time in prolonged, uninterrupted bouts may be deleteriously associated with biomarkers of glucose regulation.</p></sec>

Mechanical Stress Conditioning and Electrical Stimulation Promote Contractility and Force Maturation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Human Cardiac Tissue
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Tissue engineering enables the generation of functional human cardiac tissue with cells derived in vitro in combination with biocompatible materials. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes provide a cell source for cardiac tissue engineering; however, their immaturity limits their potential applications. Here we sought to study the effect of mechanical conditioning and electric pacing on the maturation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells were used to generate collagen-based bioengineered human cardiac tissue. Engineered tissue constructs were subjected to different mechanical stress and electric pacing conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The engineered human myocardium exhibits Frank-Starling–type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-length relationships. After 2 weeks of static stress conditioning, the engineered myocardium demonstrated increases in contractility (0.63±0.10 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 0.055±0.009 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> for no stress), tensile stiffness, construct alignment, and cell size. Stress conditioning also increased SERCA2 (Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase 2) expression, which correlated with a less negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-frequency relationship. When electric pacing was combined with static stress conditioning, the tissues showed an additional increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e production (1.34±0.19 mN/mm<sup>2</sup>), with no change in construct alignment or cell size, suggesting maturation of excitation-contraction coupling.

Experimentally realized mechanochemistry distinct from force-accelerated scission of loaded bonds
<p>Stretching polymer chains accelerates dissociation of a variety of internal covalent bonds, to an extent that correlates well with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e experienced by the scissile bond. Recent theory has also predicted scenarios in which applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e accelerates dissociation of unloaded bonds and kinetically strengthens strained bonds. We report here unambiguous experimental validation of this hypothesis: Detailed kinetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements demonstrate that stretching phosphotriesters accelerates dissociation of the unloaded phosphorus-oxygen bond orthogonal to the pulling axis, whereas stretching organosiloxanes inhibits dissociation of the aligned loaded silicon-oxygen bonds. Qualitatively, the outcome is determined by phosphoester elongation and siloxane contraction along the pulling axis in the respective rate-determining transition states. Quantitatively, the results agree with a simple mechanochemical kinetics model.</p>

Notch-Jagged complex structure implicates a catch bond in tuning ligand sensitivity
<p>Notch receptor activation initiates cell fate decisions and is distinctive in its reliance on mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e and protein glycosylation. The 2.5-angstrom-resolution crystal structure of the extracellular interacting region of Notch1 complexed with an engineered, high-affinity variant of Jagged1 (Jag1) reveals a binding interface that extends ~120 angstroms along five consecutive domains of each protein. <i>O</i>-Linked fucose modifications on Notch1 epidermal growth factor–like (EGF) domains 8 and 12 engage the EGF3 and C2 domains of Jag1, respectively, and different Notch1 domains are favored in binding to Jag1 than those that bind to the Delta-like 4 ligand. Jag1 undergoes conformational changes upon Notch binding, exhibiting catch bond behavior that prolongs interactions in the range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es required for Notch activation. This mechanism enables cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es to regulate binding, discriminate among Notch ligands, and potentiate Notch signaling.</p>

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental questions remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol formation by using extensive laboratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of rates of nucleation involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, ions, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulations and a comparison with atmospheric observations show that nearly all nucleation throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addition to sulfuric acid. A considerable fraction of nucleation involves ions, but the relatively weak dependence on ion concentrations indicates that for the processes studied, variations in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleation in the present-day atmosphere.</p>

Molecular force spectroscopy with a DNA origami–based nanoscopic force clamp

Single-stranded DNA sections of an origami structure acted as entropic springs and exerted controlled tension in the low piconewton range on a molecular system, whose conformational transitions were monitored by single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer. We used the conformer switching of a Holliday junction as a benchmark and studied the TATA-binding protein–induced bending of a DNA duplex under tension. The observed suppression of bending above 10 piconewtons provides further evidence of mechanosensitivity in gene regulation.</p>

Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> across the Mesophyll-Bundle Sheath Cell Interface in a C<sub>4</sub> Plant with Genetically Reduced PEP Carboxylase Activity
<p>Phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), localized to the cytosol of the mesophyll cell, catalyzes the first carboxylation step of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used RNA interference to target the cytosolic photosynthetic PEPC isoform in <i>Setaria viridis</i> and isolated independent transformants with very low PEPC activities. These plants required high ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for growth, consistent with the essential role of PEPC in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The combination of estimating direct CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by the bundle sheath using gas-exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements and modeling C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis with low PEPC activity allowed the calculation of bundle sheath conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>) in the progeny of these plants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements made at a range of temperatures suggested no or negligible effect of temperature on <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> depending on the technique used to calculate <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. Anatomical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements revealed that plants with reduced PEPC activity had reduced cell wall thickness and increased plasmodesmata (PD) density at the mesophyll-bundle sheath (M-BS) cell interface, whereas we observed little difference in these parameters at the mesophyll-mesophyll cell interface. The increased PD density at the M-BS interface was largely driven by an increase in the number of PD pit fields (cluster of PDs) rather than an increase in PD per pit field or the size of pit fields. The correlation of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> with bundle sheath surface area per leaf area and PD area per M-BS area showed that these parameters and cell wall thickness are important determinants of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. It is intriguing to speculate that PD development is responsive to changes in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic flux.</p>

Force-extension curves revealed a gradient, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-scattering curves showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal gradient in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

Optical Measurement of Stem Xylem Vulnerability
<p>The vulnerability of plant water transport tissues to a loss of function by cavitation during water stress is a key indicator of the survival capabilities of plant species during drought. Quantifying this important metric has been greatly advanced by noninvasive techniques that allow embolisms to be viewed directly in the vascular system. Here, we present a new method for evaluating the spatial and temporal propagation of embolizing bubbles in the stem xylem during imposed water stress. We demonstrate how the optical method, used previously in leaves, can be adapted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the xylem vulnerability of stems. Validation of the technique is carried out by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing the xylem vulnerability of 13 conifers and two short-vesseled angiosperms and comparing the results with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements made using the cavitron centrifuge method. Very close agreement between the two methods confirms the reliability of the new optical technique and opens the way to simple, efficient, and reliable assessment of stem vulnerability using standard flatbed scanners, cameras, or microscopes.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O<sub>2</sub> optode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its release.</p>

Heart rate as a predictor of metabolic rate in heterothermic bats
<p>While heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) has been used as an indicator of energy expenditure, quantitative data showing the relationship between these variables are only available for normothermic animals. To determine whether <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> also predicts oxygen consumption ([Formula]) during torpor, we simultaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed [Formula], <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and subcutaneous body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>sub</sub>) of a hibernator, Gould's long-eared bats (<i>Nyctophilus gouldi</i>, 9 g, <i>N</i>=18), at ambient temperatures (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>) between 0 and 25°C. At rest, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of normothermic resting bats was negatively correlated with <i>T</i><sub>a</sub>, with maximum <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of 803 beats min<sup>−1</sup> (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>=5°C). During torpor, the relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>a</sub> was curvilinear, and at low <i>T</i><sub>sub</sub> (~6°C), <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> fell to a minimum average of 8 beats min<sup>−1</sup>. The minimum average values for both [Formula] and <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in torpor reported here were among the lowest recorded for bats. The relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and [Formula] was significant for both resting (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.64, <i>P</i><0.001) and torpid bats (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.84, <i>P</i><0.001), with no overlap between the two states. These variables were also significantly correlated (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.44, <i>P</i><0.001) for entire torpor bouts. Moreover, estimates of [Formula] from <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> did not differ significantly from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed values during the different physiological states. Our study is the first to investigate the accuracy of <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> as a predictor of [Formula] during torpor and indicates the reliability of this method as a potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of energy expenditure in the field. Nevertheless, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> should only be used to predict [Formula] within the range of activities for which robust correlations have been established.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

The limits of applicability of the sound exposure level (SEL) metric to temporal threshold shifts (TTS) in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>The influence of fatiguing sound level and duration on post-exposure temporary threshold shift (TTS) was investigated in two beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The fatiguing sound was half-octave noise with a center frequency of 22.5 kHz. TTS was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed at a test frequency of 32 kHz. Thresholds were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by recording rhythmic evoked potentials (the envelope following response) to a test series of short (eight cycles) tone pips with a pip rate of 1000 s<sup>−1</sup>. TTS increased approximately proportionally to the dB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of both sound pressure (sound pressure level, SPL) and duration of the fatiguing noise, as a product of these two variables. In particular, when the noise parameters varied in a manner that maintained the product of squared sound pressure and time (sound exposure level, SEL, which is equivalent to the overall noise energy) at a constant level, TTS was not constant. Keeping SEL constant, the highest TTS appeared at an intermediate ratio of SPL to sound duration and decreased at both higher and lower ratios. Multiplication (SPL multiplied by log duration) better described the experimental data than an equal-energy (equal SEL) model. The use of SEL as a sole universal metric may result in an implausible assessment of the impact of a fatiguing sound on hearing thresholds in odontocetes, including under-evaluation of potential risks.</p>

Prospective randomised trial of non-operative <i>versus</i> operative management of olecranon fractures in the elderly
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this prospective randomised controlled trial was to   compare non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative management for acute isolated   displaced fractures of the olecranon in patients aged ≥ 75 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to either non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative management or   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative management with either tension-band wiring or fixation   with a plate. They were reviewed at six weeks, three and six months   and one year after the injury. The primary outcome measure was the   Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score at one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 19 patients were randomised to non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative (n =   8) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative (n = 11; tension-band wiring (n = 9), plate (n =   2)) management. The trial was stopped prematurely as the rate of   complications (nine out of 11, 81.8%) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative group was   considered to be unacceptable. There was, however, no difference   in the mean DASH scores between the groups at all times.

Satisfaction, function and repair integrity after arthroscopic <i>versus</i> mini-open rotator cuff repair
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advances in arthroscopic techniques for rotator cuff repair have   made the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> approach less popular. However, the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>   approach remains an important technique for repair for many surgeons.   The aims of this study were to compare the integrity of the repair,   the function of the shoulder and satisfaction post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively using   these two techniques in patients aged > 50 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 22 patients treated with mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> and 128 patients   treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of July 2007 and June   2011. The mean follow-up was two years (1 to 5). Outcome was assessed   using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Simple   Shoulder Test (SST) scores, and satisfaction. The integrity of the repair   was assessed using ultrasonography. A power analysis ensured sufficient   enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no statistically significant difference between the   age, function, satisfaction, or pain scores (p > 0.05) of the two   groups. The integrity of the repair and the mean SST scores were   significantly better in the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> group (91% of mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repairs   were intact <i>versus</i> 60% of arthroscopic repairs,   p = 0.023; mean SST score 10.9 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   1.3) in the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> group; 8.9 (<sc>sd</sc> 3.5) in arthroscopic   group; p = 0.003). The ASES scores were also higher in the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>   group (mean ASES score 91.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 10.5) in mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> group;   mean 82.70 (<sc>sd</sc> 19.8) in the arthroscopic group; p = 0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The integrity of the repair and function of the shoulder were   better after a mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair than after arthroscopic repair of   a rotator cuff tear in these patients.

Radiation-Induced DNA Damage in Operators Performing Endovascular Aortic Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Radiation exposure during fluoroscopically guided interventions such as endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is a growing concern for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators. This study aimed to measure DNA damage/repair markers in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators perfoming EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Expression of the DNA damage/repair marker, γ-H2AX and DNA damage response marker, phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM), were quantified in circulating lymphocytes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators during the peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative period of endovascular (infrarenal, branched, and fenestrated) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> aortic repair using flow cytometry. These markers were separately measured in the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators but this time wearing leg lead shielding in addition to upper body protection and compared with those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating with unprotected legs. Susceptibility to radiation damage was determined by irradiating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators’ blood in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>γ-H2AX and pATM levels increased significantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators immediately after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.0003 for both). Only pATM levels increased after infrarenal endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.04). Expression of both markers fell to baseline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators after 24 hours (<i>P</i><0.003 for both). There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM expression after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair. Leg protection abrogated γ-H2AX and pATM response after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair. The expression of γ-H2AX varied significantly when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators’ blood was exposed to the same radiation dose in vitro (<i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This is the first study to detect an acute DNA damage response in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators performing fluoroscopically guided aortic procedures and highlights the protective effect of leg shielding.

Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial integrity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tunnel EVH, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tunnel EVH compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tunnel EVH, and 6% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed tunnel EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Red Light-Induced Phosphorylation of Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in Stomatal Guard Cells
<p>Stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing is stimulated by red and blue light. Blue light activates plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by phosphorylating its penultimate residue, threonine, via a blue light photoreceptor phototropin-mediated signaling pathway in guard cells. Blue light-activated PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase promotes the accumulation of osmolytes and, thus, the osmotic influx of water into guard cells, driving stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing. Red light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing is thought to be dependent on photosynthesis in both guard cell chloroplasts and mesophyll cells; however, how red light induces stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing and whether PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is involved in this process have remained unclear. In this study, we established an immunohistochemical technique to detect the phosphorylation level of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and unexpectedly found that red light induces PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in whole leaves. Red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in whole leaves was correlated with stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing under red light and was inhibited by the plant hormone abscisic acid. In <i>aha1</i>-<i>9</i>, a knockout mutant of one of the major isoforms of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells, red light-dependent stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing was delayed in whole leaves. Furthermore, the photosynthetic electron transport inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea inhibited red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation as well as red light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing in whole leaves. Our results indicate that red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in guard cells promotes stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing in whole leaves, providing insight into the photosynthetic regulation of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average plant oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct regulation of phot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>iod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the phot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>iod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Functional outcomes of conservatively managed acute ruptures of the Achilles tendon
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This prospective cohort study aims to determine if the size of   the tendon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> following acute rupture of the Achilles tendon shows   an association with the functional outcome following non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   treatment. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients presenting within two weeks of an acute unilateral   rupture of the Achilles tendon between July 2012 and July 2015 were   considered for the study. In total, 38 patients (nine female, 29   male, mean age 52 years; 29 to 78) completed the study. Dynamic   ultrasound examination was performed to confirm the diagnosis and   measure the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> between ruptured tendon ends. Outcome was assessed   using dynamometric testing of plantarflexion and the Achilles tendon   Total Rupture score (ATRS) six months after the completion of a   rehabilitation programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> ≥ 10 mm with the ankle in the neutral position   had significantly greater peak torque deficit than those with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>s   < 10 mm (mean 23.3%; 7% to 52% <i>vs </i>14.3%; 0% to   47%, p = 0.023). However, there was no difference   in ATRS between the two groups (mean score 87.2; 74 to 100 <i>vs</i> 87.4;   68 to 97, p = 0.467). There was no significant correlation between   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> size and torque deficit (τ = 0.103), suggesting a non-linear relationship.   There was also no significant correlation between ATRS and peak   torque deficit (τ = -0.305). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>This is the first study to identify an association between tendon   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> and functional outcome in acute rupture of the Achilles tendon.

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-thickness cartilage loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-thickness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>sity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness   cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia.

Effectiveness of open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (UKUFF)
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The appropriate management for patients with a degenerative tear   of the rotator cuff remains controversial, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative treatment,   particularly arthroscopic surgery, is increasingly being used. Our   aim in this paper was to compare the effectiveness of arthroscopic   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair of the rotator cuff.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 273 patients were recruited to a randomised comparison   trial (136 to arthroscopic surgery and 137 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> surgery) from   19 teaching and general hospitals in the United Kingdom. The surgeons   used their usual preferred method of repair. The Oxford Shoulder   Score (OSS), two years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, was the primary outcome   measure. Imaging of the shoulder was performed at one year after   surgery. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials,   ISRCTN97804283.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean OSS improved from 26.3 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   8.2) at baseline, to 41.7 (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) two years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   for arthroscopic surgery and from 25.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 8.0) to 41.5   (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> surgery. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis   showed no statistical difference between the groups at two years   (difference in OSS score -0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75   to 1.22; p = 0.452). The confidence interval excluded the pre-determined   clinically important difference in the OSS of three points. The   rate of re-tear was not significantly different between the two groups   (46.4% for arthroscopic and 38.6% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> surgery; 95% CI -6.9   to 25.8; p = 0.256).

Revision total knee arthroplasty for failed high tibial osteotomy and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have similar patient-reported outcome measures in a two-year follow-up study
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about the relative outcomes of revision of unicompartmental   knee arthroplasty (UKA) and high tibial osteotomy (HTO) to total   knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study is to compare the   outcomes of revision surgery for the two procedures in terms of   complications, re-revision and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)   at a minimum of two years follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This study was a retrospective review of data from an institutional   arthroplasty registry for cases performed between 2001 and 2014.   A total of 292 patients were identified, of which 217 had a revision   of HTO to TKA, and 75 had revision of UKA to TKA. While mean follow-up   was longer for the HTO group compared with the UKA group, patient   demographics (age, body mass index and Charlson co-morbidity index)   and PROMs (Short Form-36, Oxford Knee Score, Knee Society Score,   both objective and functional) were similar in the two groups prior   to revision surgery. Outcomes included the rate of complications   and    re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation, PROMS and patient-reported satisfaction at six months   and two years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. We also compared the duration of   surgery and the need for revision implants in the two groups. </p></sec><sec><title>Results </title><p>At two-year follow-up, both groups of patients had made significant   improvement in terms of PROMs compared with pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative scores.   PROMs and satisfaction rates were similar in the two groups. Complications   requiring re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation were significantly more frequent in the HTO   group whilst more revision implants were used in the UKA group,   resulting in a longer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative duration. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Revision of HTO and UKA achieve similar post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative PROMs   and satisfaction.

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong> cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junction remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junction proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were identified as novel mRNA targets of FXR1 by using a BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and stabilization of its mRNA targets in heart muscle. In addition, intro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junctions and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in disease progression by regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junction remodeling. Together this study provides a novel function of FXR1, namely, that it directly regulates major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junction components, contributing to pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong> cell-cell communication in the heart.</p></sec>

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s ability   to bear weight, but historically, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative fixation has been associated   with a high rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. In this study, we describe the outcomes   of fixation using modern implants within a strategy of early return   to function.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients treated at our centre with lateral distal femoral   locking plates (LDFLP) between 2009 and 2014 were identified.

Equalisation of leg lengths in total hip arthroplasty for patients with Crowe type-IV developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>There is no consensus about the best method of achieving equal   leg lengths at total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with Crowe   type-IV developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). We reviewed our   experience of a consecutive series of patients who underwent THA   for this indication.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed 78 patients (86 THAs) with Crowe   type-IV DDH, including 64 women and 14 men, with a minimum follow-up   of two years. The mean age at the time of surgery was 52.2 years   (34 to 82). We subdivided Crowe type-IV DDH into two major types   according to the number of dislocated hips, and further categorised   them into three groups according to the occurrence of pelvic obliquity   or spinal curvature.

Contemporary failure aetiologies of the primary, posterior-stabilised total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of revision total knee arthroplasties (TKA) that are   performed is expected to increase. However, previous reports of   the causes of failure after TKA are limited in that they report   the causes at specific institutions, which are often dependent on   referral patterns. Our aim was to report the most common indications   for re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations and revisions in a large series of posterior-stabilised   TKAs undertaken at a single institution, excluding referrals from   elsewhere, which may bias the causes of failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 5098 TKAs which were undertaken between 2000 and 2012   were included in the study. Re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations, revisions with modular   component exchange, and revisions with non-modular component replacement   or removal were identified from the medical records. The mean follow-up   was five years (two to 12).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Kaplan-Meier ten-year survival without a re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation, modular   component revision and non-modular component revision was 95.7%,   99.3% and 95.3%, respectively. The most common indications for a   re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation were: post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative stiffness (58%), delayed wound healing   (21%), and patellar clunk (11%). The indications for isolated modular   component revision were acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   (64%) and instability (36%).

Aseptic loosening   was not an uncommon cause of failure, however, it was much less   common than in national registry and non-registry data.

Surgical data and radiographic parameters, including the inclination   and anteversion of the acetabular component, leg length discrepancy,   and the difference in femoral offset compared with the contralateral   hip were collected and compared, as well as the incidence of altering   the position of a component based on the intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative image.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Digital imaging took a mean of five minutes (2.3 to 14.6) to   perform.

Elimination of the male reproductive tract in the female embryo is promoted by COUP-TFII in mice
<p>The sexual differentiation paradigm contends that the female pattern of the repro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ive system is established by default because the male repro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ive tracts (Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>s) in the female degenerate owing to a lack of androgen. Here, we discovered that female mouse embryos lacking <i>Coup-tfII</i> (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II) in the Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> mesenchyme became intersex—possessing both female and male repro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ive tracts. Retention of Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>s was not caused by ectopic androgen pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion or action. Instead, enhanced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> epithelium was responsible for the retention of male structures in an androgen-independent manner. We thus suggest that elimination of Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>s in female embryos is actively promoted by COUP-TFII, which suppresses a mesenchyme-epithelium cross-talk responsible for Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> maintenance.</p>

The RopGEF2-ROP7/ROP2 Pathway Activated by phyB Suppresses Red Light-Induced Stomatal Opening<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Circadian rhythm of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e is mainly regulated by light/darkness. Blue and red light induce stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing through different mechanisms that are mediated by special receptors. ROP2, a member of Rho GTPase family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>), has been found to negatively regulate light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing. However, the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the action of RopGEFs-ROPs. Here, we showed that RopGEF2 acted as a negative regulator in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated red light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing. Meanwhile, ROP7, another member of ROP family, acting redundantly with ROP2, was regulated by RopGEF2 in this process. RopGEF2 interacted with ROP7 and ROP2 and enhanced their intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates. Furthermore, the direct interactions between phyB and RopGEF2 were detected in vitro and in plants, and phyB enhanced the GEF activity of RopGEF2 toward both ROP7 and ROP2 under light. In addition, RopGEF4 functioned redundantly with RopGEF2 in red light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing by activating both ROP7 and ROP2, and <i>RopGEF2</i>/<i>RopGEF4</i> acted genetically downstream of <i>phyB</i>; however, the GEF activity of RopGEF4 was not directly enhanced by phyB. These results revealed that red light-activated phyB enhances the GEF activities of RopGEF2 and RopGEF4 directly or indirectly, and then activate both ROP7 and ROP2 in guard cells. The negative mechanism triggered by phyB prevents the excessive stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing under red light.</p>

Effect of pre-operative expectations on the outcomes following total shoulder arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>Few studies have evaluated the relationship between patients’   pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative expectations and the outcome of orthopaedic procedures.   Our aim was to determine the effect of expectations on the outcome   after primary anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). We hypothesised   that patients with greater expectations would have better outcomes. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients undergoing primary anatomical TSA completed the Hospital   for Special Surgery’s Shoulder Expectations Survey pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.   The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Shoulder Activity   Scale (SAS), Short-Form-36 (SF-36), and visual analogue scale (VAS)   for pain, fatigue, and general health scores were also collected   pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively and two years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. Pearson correlations   were used to assess the relationship between the number of expectations   and the outcomes.

Multivariable linear   regression analysis was used to control for potential confounding   factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 67 patients were evaluated two years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.   Most parameters of outcome improved significantly from baseline   and most patients were satisfied. A greater number of expectations   was associated with a significantly greater improvement in the ASES   score (p = 0.02). In the multivariable analysis, a greater number   of expectations was an independent predictor of better ASES, VAS   and SF-36 scores, as well as improvements in ASES and VAS pain scores   (p < 0.05).

Activity levels and return to work following total knee arthroplasty in patients under 65 years of age
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about employment following total knee arthroplasty   (TKA). This study aims to identify factors which predict return   to work following TKA in patients of working age in the United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients & Methods</title><p>We prospectively assessed 289 patients (289 TKAs) aged ≤ 65 years   who underwent TKA between 2010 and 2013. There were 148 women. The   following were recorded pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively: age, gender, body mass   index, social deprivation, comorbidities, indication for surgery,   work status and nature of employment, activity level as assessed by   the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score   and Oxford Knee Score (OKS). The intention of patients to return   to work or to retire was not assessed pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. At a mean   of 3.4 years (2 to 4) post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, the return to work status,   OKS, the EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) score, UCLA activity score   and Work, Osteoarthritis and joint-Replacement (WORQ) score were   obtained. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 261 patients (90%) who were working before TKA, 105 (40%)   returned to any job, including 89 (34%) who returned to the same   job at a mean of 13.5 weeks (2 to 104) post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. A total   of 108 (41%) retired following TKA and 18 remained on welfare. Patients   not working before the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation did not return to work. Median   UCLA scores improved in 125 patients (58%) from 4 (mild activity)   to 6 (moderate activity) (p < 0.001).

Trends and risk factors for prolonged opioid use after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate trends in opioid use   after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), to identify predictors   of prolonged use and to compare the rates of opioid use after UKA,   total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We identified 4205 patients who had undergone UKA between 2007   and 2015 from the Humana Inc. administrative claims database. Post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   opioid use for one year post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively was assessed using the   rates of monthly repeat prescription.

An atrial-fibrillation-linked connexin40 mutant is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and impairs the function of atrial gap-junction channels
<p>Connexin40 (Cx40)-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>-junction channels are expressed in the atrial myocardium and provide a low-resistance passage for rapid impulse propagation. A germline mutation in the <i>GJA5</i> gene, which encodes Cx40, resulting in a truncated Cx40 (Q49X) was identified in a large Chinese family with lone (idiopathic) atrial fibrillation (AF). This mutation co-segregated with seven AF probands in an autosomal-dominant way over generations. To test the hypothesis that this Cx40 mutant affects the distribution and function of atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junctions, we studied the Q49X mutant in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>-junction-deficient HeLa and N2A cells. The Q49X mutant, unlike wild-type Cx40, was typically localized in the cytoplasm and failed to form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>-junction plaques at cell-cell interfaces. When the Q49X mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43, the mutant substantially reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>-junction plaque formation of Cx40 and Cx43. Electrophysiological studies revealed no electrical coupling of cell pairs expressing the mutant alone and a significant decrease in the coupling con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ance when the mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43. Further colocalization experiments with the organelle residential proteins indicate that Q49X was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings provide evidence that the Q49X mutant is capable of impairing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>-junction distribution and function of key atrial connexins, which might play a role in the predisposition to and onset of AF.</p>

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>-state lifetime. The structure reveals two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es on the intracellular side and two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es. Separate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T structure reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base’s interactions.</p>

Bismuthene on a SiC substrate: A candidate for a high-temperature quantum spin Hall material
<p>Quantum spin Hall materials hold the promise of revolutionary devices with dissipationless spin currents but have required cryogenic temperatures owing to small energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>s. Here we show theoretically that a room-temperature regime with a large energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> may be achievable within a paradigm that exploits the atomic spin-orbit coupling. The concept is based on a substrate-supported monolayer of a high–atomic number element and is experimentally realized as a bismuth honeycomb lattice on top of the insulating silicon carbide substrate SiC(0001). Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we detect a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> of ~0.8 electron volt and con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ive edge states consistent with theory. Our combined theoretical and experimental results demonstrate a concept for a quantum spin Hall wide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> scenario, where the chemical potential resides in the global system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>, ensuring robust edge con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ance.</p>

Discovery of orbital-selective Cooper pairing in FeSe

We show that both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>s are extremely anisotropic but nodeless and that they exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> maxima oriented orthogonally in momentum space. Moreover, by implementing a novel technique, we demonstrate that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>s have opposite sign with respect to each other. This complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> configuration reveals the existence of orbital-selective Co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong> pairing that, in FeSe, is based preferentially on electrons from the d<i><sub>yz</sub></i> orbitals of the iron atoms.</p>

Mind the gap: Neural coding of species identity in birdsong prosody
<p>Juvenile songbirds learn vocal communication from adult tutors of the same species but not from adults of other species. How species-specific learning emerges from the basic features of song prosody remains unknown. In the zebra finch auditory cortex, we discovered a class of neurons that register the silent temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>s between song syllables and are distinct from neurons encoding syllable morphology. Behavioral learning and neuronal coding of temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> structure resisted song tutoring from other species: Zebra finches fostered by Bengalese finch parents learned Bengalese finch song morphology transposed onto zebra finch temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>s. During the vocal learning period, temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> neurons fired selectively to zebra finch song. The innate temporal coding of intersyllable silent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>s suggests a neuronal barcode for conspecific vocal learning and social communication in acoustically diverse environments.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion during mantle contraction increases propulsive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

Mid-term outcomes of 77 modular radial head prostheses
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Radial head arthroplasty (RHA) may be used in the treatment of   non-reconstructable radial head fractures. The aim of this study   was to evaluate the mid-term clinical and radiographic results of   RHA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 77 RHAs were implanted in 54 men and 23   women with either acute injuries (54) or with traumatic sequelae   (23) of a fracture of the radial head. Four designs of RHA were   used, including the Guepar (Small Bone Innovations (SBi)/Stryker;   36), Evolutive (Aston Medical; 24), rHead RECON (SBi/Stryker; ten)   or rHead STANDARD (SBi/Stryker; 7) prostheses. The mean follow-up   was 74.0 months (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 38.6; 24 to 141).   The indication for further surgery, range of movement, mean Mayo   Elbow Performance (MEP) score, quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (quickDASH) score, osteolysis and positioning of the implant   were also assessed according to the design, and acute or delayed   use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean MEP and quickDASH scores were 90.2 (<sc>sd</sc> 14;   45 to 100), and 14.0 points (<sc>sd</sc> 12; 1.2 to 52.5), respectively. There   were no significant differences between RHA performed in acute or   delayed fashion. There were 30 re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations (19 with, and 11 without   removal of the implant) during the first three post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative years.   Painful loosening was the primary indication for removal in 14 patients.   Short-stemmed prostheses (16 mm to 22 mm in length) were also associated   with an increased risk of painful loosening (odds ratio 3.54 (1.02   to 12.2), p = 0.045).

Long-term outcomes of cemented <i>versus</i> cementless humeral components in arthroplasty of the shoulder
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In the initial development of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA),   the humeral component was usually fixed with cement. Cementless   components were subsequently introduced. The aim of this study was   to compare the long-term outcome of cemented and cementless humeral   components in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 cemented humeral components and   3469 cementless components. Patients with the two types of fixation   were matched for nine different covariates using a pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>sity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with cemented   and cementless components were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral component determined at revision surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative infection and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of survival were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively. Survival without loosening   at 20 years was 98% for cemented components and 92.4% for cementless   components. After pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>sity score matching including fixation as   determined by the design of the component, humeral loosening was   also found to be significantly higher in the cementless group. Survival   without humeral loosening at 20 years was 98.7% for cemented components   and 91.0% for cementless components. There was no significant difference   in the risk of intra- or post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative fracture. The rate of survival   without deep infection and the mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time were significantly   higher in the cemented group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both types of fixation give rates of long-term survival of >   90%.

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, it was found that 64 components were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was a score of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring system and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular component.   This scoring system provides a clinically useful tool for pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   planning, and the evaluation of the outcome of revision surgery   for patients with loosening of a cementless acetabular component   in the presence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:601–6.</p></sec>

A systematic review of Vancouver B2 and B3 periprosthetic femoral fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of Vancouver   type B2 and B3 fractures by performing a systematic review of the   methods of surgical treatment which have been reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic search was performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and   the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. For inclusion,   studies required a minimum of ten patients with a Vancouver type   B2 and/or ten patients with a Vancouver type B3 fracture, a minimum   mean follow-up of two years and outcomes which were matched to the type   of fracture. Studies were also required to report the rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation   as an outcome measure. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO   database. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 22 studies were included based on the eligibility   criteria, including 343 B2 fractures and 167 B3 fractures. The mean   follow-up ranged from 32 months to 74 months. </p><p>Of 343 Vancouver B2 fractures, the treatment in 298 (86.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and 45 (12.6%) were treated with internal   fixation alone. A total of 37 patients (12.4%) treated with revision   arthroplasty and six (13.3%) treated by internal fixation only underwent   further re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. </p><p>Of 167 Vancouver B3 fractures, the treatment in 160 (95.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and eight (4.8%) were treated with internal   fixation without revision. A total of 23 patients (14.4%) treated   with revision arthroplasty and two (28.6%) treated only with internal   fixation required re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A significant proportion, particularly of B2 fractures, were   treated without revision of the stem. These were associated with   a higher rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. The treatment of B3 fractures without   revision of the stem resulted in a high rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. This   demonstrates the importance of careful evaluation and accurate characterisation   of the fracture at the time of presentation to ensure the correct   management. There is a need for improvement in the reporting of   data in case series recording the outcome of the surgical treatment   of periprosthetic fractures.

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the intro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty for the treatment of a displaced intracapsular fracture in active elderly patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to analyse the long-term functional outcome of two   forms of surgical treatment for active patients aged > 70 years   with a displaced intracapsular fracture of the femoral neck. Patients   were randomised to be treated with either a hemiarthroplasty or   a total hip arthroplasty (THA). The outcome five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   for this cohort has previously been reported. We present the outcome   at 12 years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Initially 252 patients with a mean age of 81.1 years (70.2 to   95.6) were included, of whom 205 (81%) were women. A total of 137   were treated with a cemented hemiarthroplasty and 115 with a cemented   THA. At long-term follow-up we analysed the modified Harris Hip   Score (HHS), post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative complications and intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative data   of the patients who were still alive.</p></sec><sec><title>Results </title><p>At a mean follow-up of 12 years (8.23 to 16.17, standard deviation   2.24), 50 patients (20%), 32 in the hemiarthroplasty group and 18   in the THA group, were still alive, of which 47 (94%) were women.   There were no significant differences in the mean modified HHS (p   = 0.85), mortality (p = 0.13), complications (p = 0.93) or rate   of revision surgery (p = 1.0) between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the treatment of active elderly patients with an intracapsular   fracture of the hip there is no difference in the functional outcome   between hemiarthroplasty and THA treatments at 12 years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:250–4.</p></sec>

Pre-operative functional mobility as an independent determinant of inpatient functional recovery after total knee arthroplasty during three periods that coincided with changes in clinical pathways
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>To investigate whether pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative functional mobility is a   determinant of delayed inpatient recovery of activities (IRoA) after   total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in three periods that coincided with   changes in the clinical pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients (n = 682, 73% women, mean age 70 years, standard   deviation 9) scheduled for TKA between 2009 and 2015 were pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   screened for functional mobility by the Timed-up-and-Go test (TUG)   and De Morton mobility index (DEMMI). The cut-off point for delayed   IRoA was set on the day that 70% of the patients were recovered,   according to the Modified Iowa Levels of Assistance Scale (mILAS)   (a 5-item activity scale). In a multivariable logistic regression   analysis, we added either the TUG or the DEMMI to a reference model   including established determinants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both the TUG (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.10 per second, 95% confidence   intervals (CI) 1.06 to 1.15) and the DEMMI (OR 0.96 per point on   the 100-point scale, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.98) were statistically significant   determinants of delayed IRoA in a model that also included age,   BMI, ASA score and ISAR score.

Comparison of the outcome of total ankle arthroplasty for osteoarthritis with moderate and severe varus malalignment and that with neutral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic   outcomes of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) in patients with pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   moderate and severe arthritic varus ankles to those achieved for   patients with neutral ankles.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 105 patients (105 ankles), matched for age, gender,   body mass index, and follow-up duration, were divided into three   groups by pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative coronal plane tibiotalar angle; neutral   (< 5°), moderate (5° to 15°) and severe (> 15°) varus deformity.   American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot   score, a visual analogue scale (VAS), and Short Form (SF)-36 score   were used to compare the clinical outcomes after a mean follow-up period   of 51 months (24 to 147).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative AOFAS, VAS scores, range of movement and complication   rates did not significantly differ among three groups.

Ranking Businesses and Municipal Locations by Spatiotemporal Cardiac Arrest Risk to Guide Public Defibrillator Placement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to guide automated external defibrillator placement for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treatment have focused on identifying broadly defined location categories without considering hours of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. Broad location categories may be composed of many businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating hours and time of OHCA occurrence may improve automated external defibrillator accessibility. We aim to identify specific businesses and municipal locations that maximize OHCA coverage on the basis of spatiotemporal assessment of OHCA risk in the immediate vicinity of franchise locations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest database. We identified all nontraumatic public OHCAs occurring in Toronto, ON, Canada, from January 2007 through December 2015. We identified 41 unique businesses and municipal location types with ≥20 locations in Toronto from the YellowPages, Canadian Franchise Association, and the City of Toronto <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> Data Portal. We obtained their geographic coordinates and hours of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation from Web sites, by phone, or in person. We determined the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of each location when it was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> (spatiotemporal coverage) for Toronto overall and downtown. The businesses and municipal locations were then ranked by spatiotemporal OHCA coverage. To evaluate temporal stability of the rankings, we calculated intraclass correlation of the annual coverage values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 2654 nontraumatic public OHCAs. Tim Hortons ranked first in Toronto, covering 286 OHCAs. Starbucks ranked first in downtown, covering 110 OHCAs. Coffee shops and bank machines from the 5 largest Canadian banks occupied 8 of the top 10 spots in both Toronto and downtown. The rankings exhibited high temporal stability with intraclass correlation values of 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.93) in Toronto and 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.86) in downtown.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified and ranked businesses and municipal locations by spatiotemporal OHCA risk in their immediate vicinity. This approach may help policy makers and funders to identify and prioritize potential partnerships for automated external defibrillator deployment in public-access defibrillator programs.</p></sec>

Nationwide Study of the Treatment of Mycotic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Comparing Open and Endovascular Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No reliable comparative data exist between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair (OR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysms (MAAAs). This nationwide study assessed outcomes after OR and EVAR for MAAA in a population-based cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for MAAAs in Sweden between 1994 and 2014 were identified in the Swedish vascular registry. The primary aim was to assess survival after MAAA with OR and EVAR. Secondary aims were analyses of the rate of recurrent infections and re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations, and time trends in surgical treatment. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. A pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>sity score–weighted correction for risk factor differences in the 2 groups was performed, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation year to account for differences in treatment and outcomes over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 132 patients (0.6% of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ated abdominal aortic aneurysms in Sweden). Mean age was 70 years (standard deviation, 9.2), and 50 presented with rupture. Survival at 3 months was 86% (95% confidence interval, 80%–92%), at 1 year 79% (72%–86%), and at 5 years 59% (50%–68%). The preferred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative technique shifted from OR to EVAR after 2001 (proportion EVAR 1994–2000 0%, 2001–2007 58%, 2008–2014 60%). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair was performed in 62 patients (47%): aortic resection and extra-anatomic bypass (n=7), in situ reconstruction (n=50), and patch plasty (n=3); 2 patients died intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. EVAR was performed in 70 patients (53%): standard EVAR (n=55), fenestrated/branched EVAR (n=8), and visceral deviation with stent grafting (n=7); no deaths occurred intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. Survival at 3 months was lower for OR than for EVAR (74% versus 96%, <i>P</i><0.001), with a similar trend present at 1 year (73% versus 84%, <i>P</i>=0.054). A pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>sity score–weighted risk-adjusted analysis confirmed the early better survival associated with EVAR. During median follow-up of 36 and 41 months for OR and EVAR, respectively, there was no difference in long-term survival (5 years 60% versus 58%, <i>P</i>=0.771), infection-related complications (18% versus 24%, <i>P</i>=0.439), or re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation (21% versus 24%, <i>P</i>=0.650).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in treatment of MAAA in Sweden, with EVAR being the preferred treatment modality. EVAR was associated with improved short-term survival in comparison with OR, without higher associated incidence of serious infection-related complications or re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations.</p></sec>

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteoarthritis   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Our aim was to   investigate the long-term outcome of a consecutive series of patients,   some of whom had anterior knee pain and PFJ OA managed with UKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We assessed the ten-year functional outcomes and 15-year implant   survival of 805 knees (677 patients) following medial mobile-bearing   UKA. The intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative status of the PFJ was documented and, with   the exception of bone loss with grooving to the lateral side, neither   the clinical or radiological state of the PFJ nor the presence of   anterior knee pain were considered a contraindication. The impact   of radiographic findings and anterior knee pain was studied in a   subgroup of 100 knees (91 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no relationship between functional outcomes, at a mean   of ten years, or 15-year implant survival, and pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative anterior   knee pain, or the presence or degree of cartilage loss documented   intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively at the medial patella or trochlea, or radiographic   evidence of OA in the medial side of the PFJ. In 6% of cases there   was full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral side of the patella.   In these cases, the overall ten-year function and 15-year survival   was similar to those without cartilage loss; however they had slightly   more difficulty with descending stairs. Radiographic signs of OA   seen in the lateral part of the PFJ were not associated with a definite   compromise in functional outcome or implant survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ with bone loss and   grooving remains a contraindication to mobile-bearing UKA. Less   severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ and damage to the medial   side, however severe, does not compromise the overall function or   survival, so should not be considered to be a contraindication. However,   if a patient does have full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral   side of the PFJ they may have a slight compromise in their ability   to descend stairs. Pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative anterior knee pain also does not   compromise the functional outcome or survival and should not be   considered to be a contraindication.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:632–9</p></sec>

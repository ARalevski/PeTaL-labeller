Physiological Right Ventricular Adaptation in Elite Athletes of African and Afro-Caribbean Origin
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Regular, intensive exercise results in physiological biventricular cardiac adaptation. Ethnicity is an established determinant of left ventricular remodeling; black athletes (BAs) exhibit more profound LV hypertrophy than white athletes (WAs). Right ventricular (RV) remodeling has not been characterized in BAs, although the issue is pertinent because BAs commonly exhibit ECG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anomali</span></strong>es that resemble arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Between 2006 and 2012, 300 consecutive BAs (n=243 males) from 25 sporting disciplines were evaluated by use of ECG and echocardiography. Results were compared with 375 WAs and 153 sedentary control subjects (n=69 blacks). There were no ethnic differences between RV parameters in control subjects. Both BAs and WAs exhibited greater RV dimensions than control subjects. RV dimensions were marginally smaller in BAs than in WAs (proximal outflow tract, 30.9±5.5 versus 32.8±5.3 mm, <i>P</i><0.001; longitudinal dimension, 86.6±9.5 versus 89.8±9.6 mm, <i>P</i><0.001), although only 2.3% of variation was attributable to ethnicity. RV enlargement compatible with diagnostic criteria for arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy was frequently observed (proximal outflow tract ≥32 mm; 45.0% of BAs, 58.5% of WAs). Anterior T-wave inversion was present in 14.3% of BAs versus 3.7% of WAs (<i>P</i><0.001). Marked RV enlargement with concomitant anterior T-wave inversion was observed in 3.0% of BAs versus 0.3% of WAs (<i>P</i>=0.005). Further investigation did not diagnose arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy in any athlete.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Physiological RV enlargement is commonly observed in both black and white athletes. The impact of ethnicity is minimal, which obviates the need for race-specific RV reference values. However, in the context of frequent ECG repolarization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anomali</span></strong>es in BAs, the potential for erroneous diagnosis of arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy is considerably greater in this ethnic group.</p></sec>

Oligogenic inheritance of a human heart disease involving a genetic modifier
<p>Complex genetic mechanisms are thought to underlie many human diseases, yet experimental proof of this model has been elusive. Here, we show that a human cardiac anomaly can be caused by a combination of rare, inherited heterozygous mutations. Whole-exome sequencing of a nuclear family revealed that three offspring with childhood-onset cardiomyopathy had inherited three missense single-nucleotide variants in the <i>MKL2</i>, <i>MYH7</i>, and <i>NKX2-5</i> genes. The <i>MYH7</i> and <i>MKL2</i> variants were inherited from the affected, asymptomatic father and the rare <i>NKX2-5</i> variant (minor allele frequency, 0.0012) from the unaffected mother. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate mice encoding the orthologous variants and found that compound heterozygosity for all three variants recapitulated the human disease phenotype. Analysis of murine hearts and human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes provided histologic and molecular evidence for the <i>NKX2-5</i> variant’s contribution as a genetic modifier.</p>

Measuring Hall viscosity of graphene’s electron fluid
<p>An electrical conductor subjected to a magnetic field exhibits the Hall effect in the presence of current flow. Here, we report a qualitative deviation from the standard behavior in electron systems with high viscosity. We found that the viscous electron fluid in graphene responds to nonquantizing magnetic fields by producing an electric field opposite to that generated by the ordinary Hall effect. The viscous contribution is substantial and identified by studying local voltages that arise in the vicinity of current-injecting contacts. We analyzed the anomaly over a wide range of temperatures and carrier densities and extracted the Hall viscosity, a dissipationless transport coefficient that was long identified theoretically but remained elusive in experiments.</p>

Observation of chiral zero mode in inhomogeneous three-dimensional Weyl metamaterials
<p>Owing to the chirality of Weyl nodes, the Weyl systems can support one-way chiral zero modes under a strong magnetic field, which leads to nonconservation of chiral currents—the so-called chiral anomaly. Although promising for robust transport of optical information, the zero chiral bulk modes have not been observed in photonics. Here we design an inhomogeneous Weyl metamaterial in which a gauge field is generated for the Weyl nodes by engineering the individual unit cells. We experimentally confirm the presence of the gauge field and observe the zero-order chiral Landau level with one-way propagation. Without breaking the time-reversal symmetry, our system provides a route for designing an artificial magnetic field in three-dimensional photonic Weyl systems and may have potential for device applications in photonics.</p>

The Little Ice Age and 20th-century deep Pacific cooling
<p>Proxy records show that before the onset of modern anthropogenic warming, globally coherent cooling occurred from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. The long memory of the ocean suggests that these historical surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anomali</span></strong>es are associated with ongoing deep-ocean temperature adjustments. Combining an ocean model with modern and paleoceanographic data leads to a prediction that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to the cooling going into the Little Ice Age, whereas temperature trends in the surface ocean and deep Atlantic reflect modern warming. This prediction is corroborated by temperature changes identified between the HMS Challenger expedition of the 1870s and modern hydrography. The implied heat loss in the deep ocean since 1750 CE offsets one-fourth of the global heat gain in the upper ocean.</p>

Measurement of the fine-structure constant as a test of the Standard Model
<p>Measurements of the fine-structure constant α require methods from across subfields and are thus powerful tests of the consistency of theory and experiment in physics. Using the recoil frequency of cesium-133 atoms in a matter-wave interferometer, we recorded the most accurate measurement of the fine-structure constant to date: α = 1/137.035999046(27) at 2.0 × 10<sup>−10</sup> accuracy. Using multiphoton interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-Bordé interferometer and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 part per billion. Comparison with Penning trap measurements of the electron gyromagnetic anomaly <i>g<sub>e</sub></i> − 2 via the Standard Model of particle physics is now limited by the uncertainty in <i>g<sub>e</sub></i> − 2; a 2.5σ tension rejects dark photons as the reason for the unexplained part of the muon’s magnetic moment at a 99% confidence level. Implications for dark-sector candidates and electron substructure may be a sign of physics beyond the Standard Model that warrants further investigation.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anomali</span></strong>es of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Ideal Weyl points and helicoid surface states in artificial photonic crystal structures
<p>Weyl points are the crossings of linearly dispersing energy bands of three-dimensional crystals, providing the opportunity to explore a variety of intriguing phenomena such as topologically protected surface states and chiral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anomali</span></strong>es. However, the lack of an ideal Weyl system in which the Weyl points all exist at the same energy and are separated from any other bands poses a serious limitation to the further development of Weyl physics and potential applications. By experimentally characterizing a microwave photonic crystal of saddle-shaped metallic coils, we observed ideal Weyl points that are related to each other through symmetry operations. Topological surface states exhibiting helicoidal structure have also been demonstrated. Our system provides a photonic platform for exploring ideal Weyl systems and developing possible topological devices.</p>

Contrasting carbon cycle responses of the tropical continents to the 2015–2016 El Niño
<p>The 2015–2016 El Niñño led to historically high temperatures and low precipitation over the tropics, while the growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) was the largest on record. Here we quantify the response of tropical net biosphere exchange, gross primary production, biomass burning, and respiration to these climate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anomali</span></strong>es by assimilating column CO<sub>2</sub>, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, and carbon monoxide observations from multiple satellites. Relative to the 2011 La Niññña, the pantropical biosphere released 2.5 ± 0.34 gigatons more carbon into the atmosphere in 2015, consisting of approximately even contributions from three tropical continents but dominated by diverse carbon exchange processes. The heterogeneity of the carbon-exchange processes indicated here challenges previous studies that suggested that a single dominant process determines carbon cycle interannual variability.</p>

Poisons, antidotes, and selfish genes
<p>Selfish genetic elements are parasitic replicators that are specialists in ensuring their own transmission despite conferring no benefit, or even exacting a cost, on their bearers. They come in many flavors, such as transposable elements, segregation distorters, female meiotic drivers, and so-called B chromosomes (or accessory chromosomes) (<i>1</i>). Such selfish elements provide the strongest support for the gene-centric view of evolution, as popularized by Richard Dawkins in <i>The Selfish Gene</i> (<i>2</i>). On page 1051 of this issue, Ben-David <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) chase down a serendipitous observation of an anomaly in genetic crosses to unmask a toxin-antidote type of selfish system in worms.</p>

Climate change: The 2015 Paris Agreement thresholds and Mediterranean basin ecosystems
<p>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement of December 2015 aims to maintain the global average warming well below 2°C above the preindustrial level. In the Mediterranean basin, recent pollen-based reconstructions of climate and ecosystem variability over the past 10,000 years provide insights regarding the implications of warming thresholds for biodiversity and land-use potential. We compare scenarios of climate-driven future change in land ecosystems with reconstructed ecosystem dynamics during the past 10,000 years. Only a 1.5°C warming scenario permits ecosystems to remain within the Holocene variability. At or above 2°C of warming, climatic change will generate Mediterranean land ecosystem changes that are unmatched in the Holocene, a period characterized by recurring precipitation deficits rather than temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anomali</span></strong>es.</p>

Risk Factors for Coarctation of the Aorta on Prenatal Ultrasound
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prenatal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is still challenging and affected by high rates of false-positive diagnoses. The aim of this study was to ascertain the strength of association and to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of different ultrasound signs in predicting CoA prenatally.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched. Random-effects and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model meta-analyses were used to analyze the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Seven hundred ninety-four articles were identified, and 12 (922 fetuses at risk for CoA) articles were included. Mean mitral valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower (<i>P</i><0.001) and the mean tricuspid valve diameter <i>z</i> score was higher in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i>=0.01). Mean aortic valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower in fetuses with CoA than in healthy fetuses (<i>P</i>≤0.001), but the ascending aorta diameter, expressed as <i>z</i> score or millimeters, was similar between groups (<i>P</i>=0.07 and 0.47, respectively). Mean aortic isthmus diameter <i>z</i> scores measured either in sagittal (<i>P</i>=0.02) or in 3-vessel trachea view (<i>P</i><0.001) were lower in fetuses with CoA. Conversely, the mean pulmonary artery diameter <i>z</i> score, the right/left ventricular and pulmonary artery/ascending aorta diameter ratios were higher (<i>P</i><0.001, <i>P</i>=0.02, and <i>P</i>=0.02, respectively) in fetuses with CoA in comparison with controls, although aortic isthmus/arterial duct diameter ratio was lower in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i><0.001). The presence of coarctation shelf and aortic arch hypoplasia were more common in fetuses with CoA than in controls (odds ratio, 26.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.42–153; <i>P</i><0.001 and odds ratio, 38.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.01–486; <i>P</i>=0.005), whereas persistent left superior vena cava (<i>P</i>=0.85), ventricular septal defect (<i>P</i>=0.12), and bicuspid aortic valve (<i>P</i>=0.14) did not carry an increased risk for this anomaly. Multiparametric diagnostic models integrating different ultrasound signs for the detection of CoA were associated with an increased detection rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The detection rate of CoA may improve when a multiple-criteria prediction model is adopted. Further large multicenter studies sharing the same imaging protocols are needed to develop objective models for risk assessment in these fetuses.</p></sec>

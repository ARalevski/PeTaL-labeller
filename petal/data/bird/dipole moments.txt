Rice Cellulose SynthaseA8 Plant-Conserved Region Is a Coiled-Coil at the Catalytic Core Entrance
<p>The crystallographic structure of a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cellulose synthase, OsCesA8, plant-conserved region (P-CR), one of two unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s in the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of plant CesAs, was solved to 2.4 ÅÅ resolution. Two antiparallel α-helices form a coiled-coil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> linked by a large extended connector loop containing a conserved trio of aromatic residues. The P-CR structure was fit into a molecular envelope for the P-CR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data. The P-CR structure and molecular envelope, combined with a homology-based chain trace of the CesA8 catalytic core, were modeled into a previously determined CesA8 small-angle X-ray scattering molecular envelope to produce a detailed topological model of the CesA8 catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>. The predicted position for the P-CR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> from the molecular docking models places the P-CR connector loop into a hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic core, with the coiled-coil aligned near the entrance of the substrate UDP-glucose into the active site. In this configuration, the P-CR coiled-coil alone is unlikely to regulate substrate access to the active site, but it could interact with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s of CesA, accessory proteins, or other CesA catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s to control substrate delivery.</p>

Structural basis for the interaction between the cell polarity proteins Par3 and Par6
<p>Polarity is a fundamental property of most cell types. The Par protein complex is a major driving force in generating asymmetrically localized protein networks and consists of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), Par3, and Par6. Dysfunction of this complex causes developmental abnormalities and diseases such as cancer. We identified a PDZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>–binding motif in Par6 that was essential for its interaction with Par3 in vitro and for Par3-mediated membrane localization of Par6 in cultured cells. In fly embryos, we observed that the PDZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>–binding motif was functionally redundant with the PDZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> in targeting Par6 to the cortex of epithelial cells. Our structural analyses by x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy showed that both the PDZ1 and PDZ3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s but not the PDZ2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> in Par3 engaged in a canonical interaction with the PDZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>–binding motif in Par6. Par3 thus has the potential to recruit two Par6 proteins simultaneously, which may facilitate the assembly of polarity protein networks through multivalent PDZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> interactions.</p>

Cytokinin-Auxin Crosstalk in the Gynoecial Primordium Ensures Correct Domain Patterning<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium consists of two congenitally fused carpels made up of two lateral valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s and two medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s, which retain meristematic properties and later fuse to produce the female reproductive structures vital for fertilization. Polar auxin transport (PAT) is important for setting up distinct apical auxin signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s in the early floral meristem remnants allowing for lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> identity and outgrowth. Crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin plays an important role in the development of other meristematic tissues, but hormone interaction studies to date have focused on more accessible later-stage gynoecia and the spatiotemporal interactions pivotal for patterning of early gynoecium primordia remain unknown. Focusing on the earliest stages, we propose a cytokinin-auxin feedback model during early gynoecium patterning and hormone homeostasis. Our results suggest that cytokinin positively regulates auxin signaling in the incipient gynoecial primordium and strengthen the concept that cytokinin regulates auxin homeostasis during gynoecium development. Specifically, medial cytokinin promotes auxin biosynthesis components [<i>YUCCA1</i>/<i>4</i> (<i>YUC1</i>/<i>4</i>)] in, and PINFORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated auxin efflux from, the medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>. The resulting laterally focused auxin signaling triggers <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN6</i> (<i>AHP6</i>), which then represses cytokinin signaling in a PAT-dependent feedback. Cytokinin also down-regulates PIN3, promoting auxin accumulation in the apex. The <i>yuc1</i>, <i>yuc4</i>, and <i>ahp6</i> mutants are hypersensitive to exogenous cytokinin and 1-napthylphthalamic acid (NPA), highlighting their role in mediolateral gynoecium patterning. In summary, these mechanisms self-regulate cytokinin and auxin signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s, ensuring correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> specification and gynoecium development.</p>

Phosphoproteomic analysis of chimeric antigen receptor signaling reveals kinetic and quantitative differences that affect cell function
<p>Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) link an antigen recognition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> to intracellular signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s to redirect T cell specificity and function. T cells expressing CARs with CD28/CD3ζ or 4-1BB/CD3ζ signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s are effective at treating refractory B cell malignancies but exhibit differences in effector function, clinical efficacy, and toxicity that are assumed to result from the activation of divergent signaling cascades. We analyzed stimulation-induced phosphorylation events in primary human CD8<sup>+</sup> CD28/CD3ζ and 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells by mass spectrometry and found that both CAR constructs activated similar signaling intermediates. Stimulation of CD28/CD3ζ CARs activated faster and larger-magnitude changes in protein phosphorylation, which correlated with an effector T cell–like phenotype and function. In contrast, 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells preferentially expressed T cell memory–associated genes and exhibited sustained antitumor activity against established tumors in vivo. Mutagenesis of the CAR CD28 signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> demonstrated that the increased CD28/CD3ζ CAR signal intensity was partly related to constitutive association of Lck with this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> in CAR complexes. Our data show that CAR signaling pathways cannot be predicted solely by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s used to construct the receptor and that signal strength is a key determinant of T cell fate. Thus, tailoring CAR design based on signal strength may lead to improved clinical efficacy and reduced toxicity.</p>

Mechanism of Activation of Protein Kinase JAK2 by the Growth Hormone Receptor
<p>Signaling from JAK (Janus kinase) protein kinases to STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) transcription factors is key to many aspects of biology and medicine, yet the mechanism by which cytokine receptors initiate signaling is enigmatic. We present a complete mechanistic model for activation of receptor-bound JAK2, based on an archetypal cytokine receptor, the growth hormone receptor. For this, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor positioning of the JAK2 binding motif in the receptor dimer, substitution of the receptor extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s with Jun zippers to control the position of its transmembrane (TM) helices, atomistic modeling of TM helix movements, and docking of the crystal structures of the JAK2 kinase and its inhibitory pseudokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> with an opposing kinase-pseudokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> pair. Activation of the receptor dimer induced a separation of its JAK2 binding motifs, driven by a ligand-induced transition from a parallel TM helix pair to a left-handed crossover arrangement. This separation leads to removal of the pseudokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> from the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of the partner JAK2 and pairing of the two kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s, facilitating trans-activation. This model may well generalize to other class I cytokine receptors.</p>

Distinct Roles of Non-Overlapping Surface Regions of the Coiled-Coil Domain in the Potato Immune Receptor Rx1
<p>The intracellular immune receptor Rx1 of potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>), which confers effector-triggered immunity to <i>Potato virus X</i>, consists of a central nucleotide-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> (NB-ARC) flanked by a carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> and an amino-terminal coiled-coil (CC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>. Rx1 activity is strictly regulated by inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> interactions between the NB-ARC and LRR, but the contribution of the CC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> in regulating Rx1 activity or immune signaling is not fully understood. Therefore, we used a structure-informed approach to investigate the role of the CC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> in Rx1 functionality. Targeted mutagenesis of CC surface residues revealed separate regions required for the intramolecular and intermolecular interaction of the CC with the NB-ARC-LRR and the cofactor Ran GTPase-activating protein2 (RanGAP2), respectively. None of the mutant Rx1 proteins was constitutively active, indicating that the CC does not contribute to the autoinhibition of Rx1 activity. Instead, the CC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> acted as a modulator of downstream responses involved in effector-triggered immunity. Systematic disruption of the hydrophobic interface between the four helices of the CC enabled the uncoupling of cell death and disease resistance responses. Moreover, a strong dominant negative effect on Rx1-mediated resistance and cell death was observed upon coexpression of the CC alone with full-length Rx1 protein, which depended on the RanGAP2-binding surface of the CC. Surprisingly, coexpression of the N-terminal half of the CC enhanced Rx1-mediated resistance, which further indicated that the CC functions as a scaffold for downstream components involved in the modulation of disease resistance or cell death signaling.</p>

The Src family kinase Fgr is a transforming oncoprotein that functions independently of SH3-SH2 domain regulation
<p>Fgr is a member of the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, which are overexpressed and constitutively active in many human cancers. Fgr expression is restricted to myeloid hematopoietic cells and is markedly increased in a subset of bone marrow samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we investigated the oncogenic potential of Fgr using Rat-2 fibroblasts that do not express the kinase. Expression of either wild-type or regulatory tail-mutant constructs of Fgr promoted cellular transformation (inferred from colony formation in soft agar), which was accompanied by phosphorylation of the Fgr activation loop, suggesting that the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of Fgr functions independently of regulation by its noncatalytic SH3-SH2 region. Unlike other family members, recombinant Fgr was not activated by SH3-SH2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> ligands. However, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry data suggested that the regulatory SH3 and SH2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s packed against the back of the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> in a Src-like manner. Sequence alignment showed that the activation loop of Fgr was distinct from that of all other Src family members, with proline rather than alanine at the +2 position relative to the activation loop tyrosine. Substitution of the activation loop of Fgr with the sequence from Src partially inhibited kinase activity and suppressed colony formation. Last, Fgr expression enhanced the sensitivity of human myeloid progenitor cells to the cytokine GM-CSF. Because its kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> is not sensitive to SH3-SH2–mediated control, simple overexpression of Fgr without mutation may contribute to oncogenic transformation in AML and other blood cancers.</p>

A cryo-EM–based model of phosphorylation- and FKBP12.6-mediated allosterism of the cardiac ryanodine receptor
<p>Type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) are calcium channels that play a vital role in triggering cardiac muscle contraction by releasing calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. Several cardiomyopathies are associated with the abnormal functioning of RyR2. We determined the three-dimensional structure of rabbit RyR2 in complex with the regulatory protein FKBP12.6 in the closed state at 11.8 óÅÅ resolution using cryo-electron microscopy and built an atomic model of RyR2. The heterogeneity in the data set revealed two RyR2 conformations that we proposed to be related to the extent of phosphorylation of the P2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>. Because the more flexible conformation may correspond to RyR2 with a phosphorylated P2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>, we suggest that phosphorylation may set RyR2 in a conformation that needs less energy to transition to the open state. Comparison of RyR2 from cardiac muscle and RyR1 from skeletal muscle showed substantial structural differences between the two, especially in the helical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> 2 (HD2) structure forming the Clamp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>, which participates in quaternary interactions with the dihydropyridine receptor and neighboring RyRs in RyR1 but not in RyR2. Rigidity of the HD2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of RyR2 was enhanced by binding of FKBP12.6, a ligand that stabilizes RyR2 in the closed state. These results help to decipher the molecular basis of the different mechanisms of activation and oligomerization of the RyR isoforms and could be extended to RyR complexes in other tissues.</p>

Acetylation-dependent regulation of MDM2 E3 ligase activity dictates its oncogenic function
<p>Abnormal activation of the oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is frequently observed in human cancers. By ubiquitinating the tumor suppressor p53 protein, which leads to its proteasome-mediated destruction, MDM2 limits the tumor-suppressing activity of p53. On the other hand, by ubiquitinating itself, MDM2 targets itself for destruction and promotes the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, a process that can be antagonized by the deubiquitinase herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP). We investigated the regulation of MDM2 substrate specificity and found that acetyltransferase p300–mediated acetylation and stabilization of MDM2 are molecular switches that block self-ubiquitination, thereby shifting its E3 ligase activity toward p53. In vitro and in cancer cell lines, p300-mediated acetylation of MDM2 on Lys<sup>182</sup> and Lys<sup>185</sup> enabled HAUSP to bind, presumably deubiquitinate, and stabilize MDM2. This acetylation within the nuclear localization signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> decreased its interaction with the acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>, subsequently increased the interaction between the acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> and RING <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> in MDM2, enabled the binding of HAUSP to the acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> in MDM2, and shifted MDM2 activity from autoubiquitination to p53 ubiquitination. However, upon genotoxic stress through exposure to etoposide, the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylated MDM2 at Lys<sup>182</sup> and Lys<sup>185</sup>, thereby promoting self-ubiquitination and less ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53, thus increasing p53-dependent apoptosis. Therefore, this study indicates that dynamic acetylation is a molecular switch in the regulation of MDM2 substrate specificity, revealing further insight into the posttranslational regulation of the MDM2/p53 cell survival axis.</p>

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness

The B-Box Domain Protein BBX21 Promotes Photomorphogenesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>B-box-containing (BBX) proteins play critical roles in a variety of cellular and developmental processes in plants. BBX21 (also known as SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG2), which contains two B-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s in tandem at the N terminus, has been previously demonstrated as a key component involved in the COP1-HY5 signaling hub. However, the exact molecular and physiological roles of B-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s in BBX21 are largely unclear. Here, we found that structurally disruption of the second B-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>, but not the first one, in BBX21 completely abolishes its biological and physiological activity in conferring hyperphotomorphogenetic phenotype in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Intact B-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s in BBX21 are not required for interaction with COP1 and its degradation by COP1 via the 26S proteasome system. However, disruption of the second B-box of BBX21 nearly impairs its ability for binding of <i>T/G-box</i> within the <i>HY5</i> promoter both in vitro and in vivo, as well as controlling <i>HY5</i> and HY5-regulated gene expression in Arabidopsis seedlings. Taken together, this study provides a mechanistic framework in which BBX21 directly binds to the <i>T/G-box</i> present in the <i>HY5</i> promoter possibly through its second B-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>, which in turn controls <i>HY5</i> and HY5-regulated gene expression to promote photomorphogenesis.</p>

Analysis of the ZAR1 Immune Complex Reveals Determinants for Immunity and Molecular Interactions<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants depend on innate immunity to prevent disease. Plant pathogenic bacteria, like <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>, use the type III secretion system as a molecular syringe to inject type III secreted effector (T3SE) proteins in plants. The primary function of most T3SEs is to suppress immunity; however, the plant can evolve nucleotide-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>-leucine-rich repeat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>-containing proteins to recognize specific T3SEs. The AtZAR1 NLR induces strong defense responses against <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>X. campestris</i>. The <i>P. syringae</i> T3SE HopZ1a is an acetyltransferase that acetylates the pseudokinase AtZED1 and triggers recognition by AtZAR1. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that lead to AtZAR1-induced immunity in response to HopZ1a. We established a transient expression system in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> to study detailed interactions among HopZ1a, AtZED1, and AtZAR1. We show that the AtZAR1 immune pathway is conserved in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and identify AtZAR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s, and residues in AtZAR1 and AtZED1, that are important for immunity and protein-protein interactions in planta and in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>). We show that the coiled-coil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of AtZAR1 oligomerizes, and this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> acts as a signal to induce immunity. This detailed analysis of the AtZAR1-AtZED1 protein complex provides a better understanding of the immune signaling hub controlled by AtZAR1.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also binds with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> channels already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which assembles with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, binds to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> channel via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to channel-gating control. Binding to the VAMP721 SNARE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> suppressed channel gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> conferred specificity on VAMP721 binding without influencing gating. Channel binding was defined by a linear motif within the longin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>. The SNARE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> is thought to wrap around this structure when not assembled with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed channel binding and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s. The presence of these two channel-binding sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex assembly, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that binding begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> channel gating during SNARE assembly and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> channels are nucleation points for SNARE complex assembly.</p>

Tracing the origin and evolution of pseudokinases across the tree of life
<p>Protein phosphorylation by eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) is a fundamental mechanism of cell signaling in all organisms. In model vertebrates, ~10% of ePKs are classified as pseudokinases, which have amino acid changes within the catalytic machinery of the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> that distinguish them from their canonical kinase counterparts. However, pseudokinases still regulate various signaling pathways, usually doing so in the absence of their own catalytic output. To investigate the prevalence, evolutionary relationships, and biological diversity of these pseudoenzymes, we performed a comprehensive analysis of putative pseudokinase sequences in available eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal proteomes. We found that pseudokinases are present across all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s of life, and we classified nearly 30,000 eukaryotic, 1500 bacterial, and 20 archaeal pseudokinase sequences into 86 pseudokinase families, including ~30 families that were previously unknown. We uncovered a rich variety of pseudokinases with notable expansions not only in animals but also in plants, fungi, and bacteria, where pseudokinases have previously received cursory attention.

Kinase domain dimerization drives RIPK3-dependent necroptosis
<p>Necroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death, is initiated by the activation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), which depends on its interaction with RIPK1. Although catalytically inactive, the RIPK3 mutant D161N still stimulates RIPK1-dependent apoptosis and embryonic lethality in RIPK3 D161N homozygous mice. Whereas the absence of RIPK1 rescues RIPK3 D161N homozygous mice, we report that the absence of RIPK1 leads to embryonic lethality in RIPK3 D161N heterozygous mice. This suggested that the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of RIPK3 had a noncatalytic function that was enhanced by a conformation induced by the D161N mutation. We found that the RIPK3 kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> homodimerized through a surface that is structurally similar to that of the RAF family members. Mutation of residues at the dimer interface impaired dimerization and necroptosis. Kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> dimerization stimulated the activation of RIPK3 through cis-autophosphorylation. This noncatalytic, allosteric activity was enhanced by certain kinase-deficient mutants of RIPK3, including D161N. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by certain RIPK3 inhibitors was also dependent on the kinase dimerization interface. Our studies reveal that the RIPK3 kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> exhibits catalytically independent function that is important for both RIPK3-dependent necroptosis and apoptosis.</p>

Intracellular cavity of sensor domain controls allosteric gating of TRPA1 channel
<p>Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a temperature-sensitive ion channel activated by various pungent and irritant compounds that can produce pain in humans. Its activation involves an allosteric mechanism whereby electrophilic agonists evoke interactions within cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s and open the channel pore through an integrated nexus formed by intracellular membrane proximal regions that are densely packed beneath the lower segment of the S1–S4 sensor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>. Studies indicate that this part of the channel may contain residues that form a water-accessible cavity that undergoes changes in solvation during channel gating. We identified conserved polar residues facing the putative lower crevice of the sensor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> that were crucial determinants of the electrophilic, voltage, and calcium sensitivity of the TRPA1 channel. This part of the sensor may also comprise a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> capable of binding to membrane phosphoinositides through which gating of the channel is regulated in a state-dependent manner.</p>

Ligand-activated Notch undergoes DTX4-mediated ubiquitylation and bilateral endocytosis before ADAM10 processing
<p>The Notch signaling pathway, which is activated by cell-cell contact, is a major regulator of cell fate decisions. Mammalian Notch1 is present at the cell surface as a heterodimer of the Notch extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> associated with the transmembrane and intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s. After ligand binding, Notch undergoes proteolysis, releasing the Notch intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> (NICD) that regulates gene expression. We monitored the early steps of activation with biochemical analysis, immunofluorescence analysis, and live-cell imaging of Notch1-expressing cells. We found that, upon ligand binding, Notch1 at the cell surface was ubiquitylated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX4. This ubiquitylation event led to the internalization of the Notch1 extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> by the ligand-expressing cell and the internalization of the membrane-anchored fragment of Notch1 and DTX4 by the Notch1-expressing cell, which we referred to as bilateral endocytosis. ADAM10 generates a cleavage product of Notch that is necessary for the formation of the NICD, which has been thought to occur at the cell surface. However, we found that blocking dynamin-mediated endocytosis of Notch1 and DTX4 reduced the colocalization of Notch1 with ADAM10 and the formation of the ADAM10-generated cleavage product of Notch1, suggesting that ADAM10 functions in an intracellular compartment to process Notch. Thus, this study suggests that a specific pool of ADAM10 acts on Notch in an endocytic compartment, rather than at the cell surface.</p>

The structure of a membrane adenylyl cyclase bound to an activated stimulatory G protein
<p>Membrane-integral adenylyl cyclases (ACs) are key enzymes in mammalian heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)–dependent signal transduction, which is important in many cellular processes. Signals received by the G protein–coupled receptors are conveyed to ACs through G proteins to modulate the levels of cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Here, we describe the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the bovine membrane AC9 bound to an activated G protein αs subunit at 3.4-angstrom resolution. The structure reveals the organization of the membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> and helical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> that spans between the membrane and catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s of AC9. The carboxyl-terminal extension of the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> occludes both the catalytic and the allosteric sites of AC9, inducing a conformation distinct from the substrate- and activator-bound state, suggesting a regulatory role in cAMP production.</p>

Ligand-triggered allosteric ADP release primes a plant NLR complex
<p>Pathogen recognition by nucleotide-binding (NB), leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors (NLRs) plays roles in plant immunity. The <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> pv.<i> campestris</i> effector AvrAC uridylylates the <i>Arabidopsis</i> PBL2 kinase, and the latter (PBL2<sup>UMP</sup>) acts as a ligand to activate the NLR ZAR1 precomplexed with the RKS1 pseudokinase. Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy structures of ZAR1-RKS1 and ZAR1-RKS1-PBL2<sup>UMP</sup> in an inactive and intermediate state, respectively. The ZAR1<sup>LRR</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>, compared with animal NLR<sup>LRR</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s, is differently positioned to sequester ZAR1 in an inactive state. Recognition of PBL2<sup>UMP</sup> is exclusively through RKS1, which interacts with ZAR1<sup>LRR</sup>. PBL2<sup>UMP</sup> binding stabilizes the RKS1 activation segment, which sterically blocks ZAR1 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) binding. This engenders a more flexible NB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> without conformational changes in the other ZAR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s.

Super-resolution chromatin tracing reveals domains and cooperative interactions in single cells
<p>The spatial organization of chromatin is pivotal for regulating genome functions. We report an imaging method for tracing chromatin organization with kilobase- and nanometer-scale resolution, unveiling chromatin conformation across topologically associating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s (TADs) in thousands of individual cells. Our imaging data revealed TAD-like structures with globular conformation and sharp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> boundaries in single cells. The boundaries varied from cell to cell, occurring with nonzero probabilities at all genomic positions but preferentially at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)- and cohesin-binding sites. Notably, cohesin depletion, which abolished TADs at the population-average level, did not diminish TAD-like structures in single cells but eliminated preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> boundary positions. Moreover, we observed widespread, cooperative, multiway chromatin interactions, which remained after cohesin depletion. These results provide critical insight into the mechanisms underlying chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> and hub formation.</p>

Dicer uses distinct modules for recognizing dsRNA termini
<p>Invertebrates rely on Dicer to cleave viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and <i>Drosophila</i> Dicer-2 distinguishes dsRNA substrates by their termini. Blunt termini promote processive cleavage, while 3′ overhanging termini are cleaved distributively. To understand this discrimination, we used cryo–electron microscopy to solve structures of <i>Drosophila</i> Dicer-2 alone and in complex with blunt dsRNA. Whereas the Platform-PAZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s have been considered the only Dicer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s that bind dsRNA termini, unexpectedly, we found that the helicase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> is required for binding blunt, but not 3′ overhanging, termini. We further showed that blunt dsRNA is locally unwound and threaded through the helicase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> in an adenosine triphosphate–dependent manner. Our studies reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for optimizing antiviral defense and set the stage for the discovery of helicase-dependent functions in other Dicers.</p>

Notch-Jagged complex structure implicates a catch bond in tuning ligand sensitivity

This mechanism enables cellular forces to regulate binding, discriminate among Notch ligands, and potentiate Notch signaling.</p>

An Arabidopsis TIR-Lectin Two-Domain Protein Confers Defense Properties against <i>Tetranychus urticae</i>
<p>Plant immunity depends on fast and specific transcriptional reprogramming triggered by the perception of biotic stresses. Numerous studies have been conducted to better understand the response of plants to the generalist herbivore two-spotted spider mite (<i>Tetranychus urticae</i>). However, how plants perceive mites and how this perception is translated into changes in gene expression are largely unknown. In this work, we identified a gene induced in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) upon spider mite attack that encodes a two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> protein containing predicted lectin and Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s. The gene, previously named <i>PP2-A5</i>, belongs to the Phloem Protein2 family. Biotic assays showed that PP2-A5 confers tolerance to <i>T. urticae</i>. Overexpression or knockout of <i>PP2-A5</i> leads to transcriptional reprogramming that alters the balance of hormone accumulation and corresponding signaling pathways. The nucleocytoplasmic location of this protein supports a direct interaction with regulators of gene transcription, suggesting that the combination of two putative signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s in a single protein may provide a novel mechanism for regulating gene expression. Together, our results suggest that PP2-A5 improves the ability to defend against <i>T. urticae</i> by participating in the tight regulation of hormonal cross talk upon mite feeding. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism by which this two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> protein functions and to clarify its molecular role in signaling following a spider mite attack.</p>

Efficient ER Fusion Requires a Dimerization and a C-Terminal Tail Mediated Membrane Anchoring of RHD3
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of tubules and sheets stretching throughout the eukaryotic cells. The formation of the ER requires homotypic membrane fusion, which is mediated by a family of Dynamin-like Atlastin GTPase proteins. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) member ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE3 (RHD3) has been demonstrated to mediate ER membrane fusion, but how exactly RHD3 is involved in the process is still unknown. Here we conducted systemic structure-function analyses of roles of different RHD3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s in mediating ER fusion. We showed that efficient ER membrane fusion mediated by RHD3 requires a proper dimerization of RHD3 through the GTPase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> (GD) and the first and second three helix bundles (3HBs) in the middle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>. RHD3 has a 3HB-enriched middle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> longer than that of Atlastins, and we revealed that the third and fourth 3HBs are required for the stability of RHD3. The transmembrane segments of RHD3 are essential for targeting and retention of RHD3 in the ER and can also facilitate an oligomerization of RHD3. Furthermore, we showed that an amphipathic helix in the C-terminal cytosolic tail of RHD3 has a membrane anchoring ability that is required for efficient ER membrane fusion mediated by RHD3. This work contributes to a better understanding of a coordinated action of RHD3 in the fusion of ER membranes.</p>

A Framework for Lateral Membrane Trafficking and Polar Tethering of the PEN3 ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter
<p>The outermost cell layer of plants, the epidermis, and its outer (lateral) membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> facing the environment are continuously challenged by biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, the epidermis and the outer membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> provide important selective and protective barriers. However, only a small number of specifically outer membrane-localized proteins are known. Similarly, molecular mechanisms underlying the trafficking and the polar placement of outer membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> proteins require further exploration. Here, we demonstrate that ACTIN7 (ACT7) mediates trafficking of the PENETRATION3 (PEN3) outer membrane protein from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane in the root epidermis of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and that actin function contributes to PEN3 endocytic recycling. In contrast to such generic ACT7-dependent trafficking from the TGN, the EXOCYST84b (EXO84b) tethering factor mediates PEN3 outer-membrane polarity. Moreover, precise EXO84b placement at the outer membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> itself requires ACT7 function. Hence, our results uncover spatially and mechanistically distinct requirements for ACT7 function during outer lateral membrane cargo trafficking and polarity establishment. They further identify an exocyst tethering complex mediator of outer lateral membrane cargo polarity.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Human Cells in Terms of Protein Innovation
<p>Humans are composed of hundreds of cell types. As the genomic DNA of each somatic cell is identical, cell type is determined by what is expressed and when. Until recently, little has been reported about the determinants of human cell identity, particularly from the joint perspective of gene evolution and expression. Here, we chart the evolutionary past of all documented human cell types via the collective histories of proteins, the principal product of gene expression. FANTOM5 data provide cell-type–specific digital expression of human protein-coding genes and the SUPERFAMILY resource is used to provide protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> annotation. The evolutionary epoch in which each protein was created is inferred by comparison with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> annotation of all other completely sequenced genomes. Studying the distribution across epochs of genes expressed in each cell type reveals insights into human cellular evolution in terms of protein innovation. For each cell type, its history of protein innovation is charted based on the genes it expresses. Combining the histories of all cell types enables us to create a timeline of cell evolution. This timeline identifies the possibility that our common ancestor Coelomata (cavity-forming animals) provided the innovation required for the innate immune system, whereas cells which now form the brain of human have followed a trajectory of continually accumulating novel proteins since Opisthokonta (boundary of animals and fungi). We conclude that exaptation of existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> architectures into new contexts is the dominant source of cell-type–specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> architectures.</p>

A SAP domain-containing protein shuttles between the nucleus and cell membranes and plays a role in adhesion and migration in <i>D. discoideum</i>
<p>The AmpA protein reduces cell adhesion, thereby influencing cell migration in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. To understand how <i>ampA</i> influences cell migration, second site suppressors of an AmpA overexpressing cell line were created by REMI mutagenesis. Mutant candidates were identified by their ability to suppress the large plaques that the AmpA overexpressing cells form on bacterial lawns as a result of their increased rate of migration. One suppressor gene, <i>sma</i>, encodes an uncharacterized protein, which contains a SAP DNA-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> and a PTEN-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>. Using <i>sma</i> gene knockouts and Sma-mRFP expressing cell lines, a role for <i>sma</i> in influencing cell migration was uncovered. Knockouts of the <i>sma</i> gene in a wild-type background enhanced chemotaxis. An additional role for Sma in influencing cell–cell adhesion was also demonstrated. Sma protein transitions between cytosolic and nuclear localizations as a function of cell density. In growing cells migrating to folic acid it is localized to regions of actin polymerization and absent from the nucleus. A role for Sma in influencing <i>ampA</i> mRNA levels is also demonstrated. Sma additionally appears to be involved in <i>ampA</i> pathways regulating cell size, actin polymerization, and cell substrate adhesion. We present insights to the SAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>-containing group of proteins in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and provide evidence of a role for a SAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>-containing protein shuttling from the nucleus to sites of actin polymerization during chemotaxis to folic acid and influencing the efficiency of migration.</p>

Reconstitution and structure of a plant NLR resistosome conferring immunity

Besides the nucleotide-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>, the coiled-coil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of ZAR1 also contributes to resistosome pentamerization by forming an α-helical barrel that interacts with the leucine-rich repeat and winged-helix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s.

ER-mitochondria tethering by PDZD8 regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in mammalian neurons
<p>Interfaces between organelles are emerging as critical platforms for many biological responses in eukaryotic cells. In yeast, the ERMES complex is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–mitochondria tether composed of four proteins, three of which contain a SMP (synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial-lipid binding protein) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>. No functional ortholog for any ERMES protein has been identified in metazoans. Here, we identified PDZD8 as an ER protein present at ER-mitochondria contacts. The SMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of PDZD8 is functionally orthologous to the SMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> found in yeast Mmm1. PDZD8 was necessary for the formation of ER-mitochondria contacts in mammalian cells. In neurons, PDZD8 was required for calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) uptake by mitochondria after synaptically induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release from ER and thereby regulated cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Thus, PDZD8 represents a critical ER-mitochondria tethering protein in metazoans. We suggest that ER-mitochondria coupling is involved in the regulation of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in mammalian neurons.</p>

We found that the RID is an N<sup>ε</sup>-fatty acyltransferase that covalently modifies the lysine residues in the C-terminal polybasic region of Rho GTPases. The resulting fatty acylation inhibited Rho GTPases and disrupted Rho GTPase–mediated signaling in the host. Thus, RID can mediate the lysine N<sup>ε</sup>-fatty acylation of mammalian proteins and represents a family of toxins that harbor N-fatty acyltransferase activities in bacterial pathogens.</p>

A cyclic oligonucleotide signaling pathway in type III CRISPR-Cas systems
<p>Type III CRISPR-Cas systems in prokaryotes provide immunity against invading nucleic acids through the coordinated degradation of transcriptionally active DNA and its transcripts by the Csm effector complex. The Cas10 subunit of the complex contains an HD nuclease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> that is responsible for DNA degradation and two Palm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s with elusive functions. In addition, Csm6, a ribonuclease that is not part of the complex, is also required to provide full immunity. We show here that target RNA binding by the Csm effector complex of <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i> triggers Cas10 to synthesize cyclic oligoadenylates (cA<i><sub>n</sub></i>; <i>n</i> = 2 to 6) by means of the Palm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s. Acting as signaling molecules, cyclic oligoadenylates bind Csm6 to activate its nonspecific RNA degradation. This cyclic oligoadenylate–based signaling pathway coordinates different components of CRISPR-Cas to prevent phage infection and propagation.</p>

Gene bivalency at Polycomb domains regulates cranial neural crest positional identity
<p>The cranial neural crest cells are multipotent cells that provide head skeletogenic mesenchyme and are crucial for craniofacial patterning. We analyzed the chromatin landscapes of mouse cranial neural crest subpopulations in vivo. Early postmigratory subpopulations contributing to distinct mouse craniofacial structures displayed similar chromatin accessibility patterns yet differed transcriptionally. Accessible promoters and enhancers of differentially silenced genes carried H3K27me3/H3K4me2 bivalent chromatin marks embedded in large <i>enhancer of zeste homolog 2</i>–dependent Polycomb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s, indicating transcriptional poising. These postmigratory bivalent chromatin regions were already present in premigratory progenitors. At Polycomb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s, H3K27me3 antagonized H3K4me2 deposition, which was restricted to accessible sites. Thus, bivalent Polycomb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s provide a chromatin template for the regulation of cranial neural crest cell positional identity in vivo, contributing insights into the epigenetic regulation of face morphogenesis.</p>

A conserved NAD<sup>+</sup> binding pocket that regulates protein-protein interactions during aging
<p>DNA repair is essential for life, yet its efficiency declines with age for reasons that are unclear. Numerous proteins possess Nudix homology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s (NHDs) that have no known function. We show that NHDs are NAD<sup>+</sup> (oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s that regulate protein-protein interactions. The binding of NAD<sup>+</sup> to the NHD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) prevents it from inhibiting PARP1 [poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase], a critical DNA repair protein. As mice age and NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations decline, DBC1 is increasingly bound to PARP1, causing DNA damage to accumulate, a process rapidly reversed by restoring the abundance of NAD<sup>+</sup>. Thus, NAD<sup>+</sup> directly regulates protein-protein interactions, the modulation of which may protect against cancer, radiation, and aging.</p>

Structure of a eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel at near-atomic resolution
<p>Voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels are responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. They are associated with a variety of channelopathies and are targeted by multiple pharmaceutical drugs and natural toxins. Here, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a putative Na<sub>v</sub> channel from American cockroach (designated Na<sub>v</sub>PaS) at 3.8 angstrom resolution. The voltage-sensing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s (VSDs) of the four repeats exhibit distinct conformations. The entrance to the asymmetric selectivity filter vestibule is guarded by heavily glycosylated and disulfide bond–stabilized extracellular loops. On the cytoplasmic side, a conserved amino-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> is placed below VSD<sub>I</sub>, and a carboxy-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> binds to the III-IV linker. The structure of Na<sub>v</sub>PaS establishes an important foundation for understanding function and disease mechanism of Na<sub>v</sub> and related voltage-gated calcium channels.</p>

RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2-Mediated Transcriptional Repression Regulates Vegetative and Reproductive Architecture
<p>Transcriptional repression in multicellular organisms orchestrates dynamic and precise gene expression changes that enable complex developmental patterns. Here, we present phenotypic and molecular characterization of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) transcriptional corepressor RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2 (REL2), a unique member of the highly conserved TOPLESS (TPL) family. Analysis of single recessive mutations in <i>rel2</i> revealed an array of vegetative and reproductive phenotypes, many related to defects in meristem initiation and maintenance. To better understand how REL2-mediated transcriptional complexes relate to <i>rel2</i> phenotypes, we performed protein interaction assays and transcriptional profiling of mutant inflorescences, leading to the identification of different maize transcription factors and regulatory pathways that employ REL2 repression to control traits directly impacting maize yields. In addition, we used our REL2 interaction data to catalog conserved repression motifs present on REL2 interactors and showed that two of these, RLFGV- and DLN-type motifs, interact with the C-terminal WD40 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of REL2 rather than the N terminus, which is known to bind LxLxL EAR motifs. These findings establish that the WD40 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of TPL family proteins is an independent protein interaction surface that may work together with the N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> to allow the formation of large macromolecular complexes of functionally related transcription factors.</p>

Characterization of Multiple C2 Domain and Transmembrane Region Proteins in Arabidopsis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Multiple C2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> and transmembrane region proteins (MCTPs) are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotic organisms and may function as signaling molecules that mediate trafficking of other regulators. Although there are a large number of MCTPs found in the plant lineage, biological information on most plant MCTPs remains unknown. Here, we report systematic characterization of 16 members in the entire Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MCTP family. Using GUS and GFP reporter assays, we reveal their distinct or overlapping patterns of gene expression and protein localization in developing Arabidopsis plants and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf epidermal cells. We further analyze in vivo effects of three C2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s on the regulatory role of MCTP1 (FTIP1) in flowering time control in Arabidopsis, demonstrating that these C2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s may be cooperative to mediate FTIP1 function during the floral transition. Through examining all available T-DNA insertional mutants of Arabidopsis <i>MCTPs</i>, we further reveal that <i>mctp6-1</i> significantly enhances the late-flowering phenotype of <i>ftip1-1</i> possibly through affecting FLOWERING LOCUS T in different manners, exemplifying that different MCTPs additively regulate a specific plant developmental process. Taken together, our results suggest functional divergence or redundancy of MCTP members in Arabidopsis and provide a community resource for further understanding various MCTP functions in plant development.</p>

Pollen Aperture Factor INP1 Acts Late in Aperture Formation by Excluding Specific Membrane Domains from Exine Deposition
<p>Accurate placement of extracellular materials is a critical part of cellular development. To study how cells achieve this accuracy, we use formation of pollen apertures as a model. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), three regions on the pollen surface lack deposition of pollen wall exine and develop into apertures. In developing pollen, Arabidopsis <i>INAPERTURATE POLLEN1</i> (INP1) protein acts as a marker for the preaperture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s, assembling there into three punctate lines. To understand the mechanism of aperture formation, we studied the dynamics of INP1 expression and localization and its relationship with the membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s at which it assembles. We found that INP1 assembly occurs after meiotic cytokinesis at the interface between the plasma membrane and the overlying callose wall, and requires the normal callose wall formation. Sites of INP1 localization coincide with positions of protruding membrane ridges in proximity to the callose wall. Our data suggest that INP1 is a late-acting factor involved in keeping specific membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s next to the callose wall to prevent formation of exine at these sites.</p>

Auxin and ROP GTPase Signaling of Polar Nuclear Migration in Root Epidermal Hair Cells
<p>Polar nuclear migration is crucial during the development of diverse eukaryotes. In plants, root hair growth requires polar nuclear migration into the outgrowing hair. However, knowledge about the dynamics and the regulatory mechanisms underlying nuclear movements in root epidermal cells remains limited. Here, we show that both auxin and Rho-of-Plant (ROP) signaling modulate polar nuclear position at the inner epidermal plasma membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> oriented to the cortical cells during cell elongation as well as subsequent polar nuclear movement to the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> into the emerging hair bulge in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Auxin signaling via the nuclear AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE ACETIC ACID7 pathway ensures correct nuclear placement toward the inner membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>. Moreover, precise inner nuclear placement relies on SPIKE1 Rho-GEF, SUPERCENTIPEDE1 Rho-GDI, and ACTIN7 (ACT7) function and to a lesser extent on VTI11 vacuolar SNARE activity. Strikingly, the directionality and/or velocity of outer polar nuclear migration into the hair outgrowth along actin strands also are ACT7 dependent, auxin sensitive, and regulated by ROP signaling. Thus, our findings provide a founding framework revealing auxin and ROP signaling of inner polar nuclear position with some contribution by vacuolar morphology and of actin-dependent outer polar nuclear migration in root epidermal hair cells.</p>

Multifunctional RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Storage Protein mRNA Transport and Localization
<p>The multifunctional RNA-binding protein Tudor-SN plays multiple roles in transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes due to its modular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> structure, consisting of four tandem <i>Staphylococcus</i> nuclease (SN)-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s (4SN), followed by a carboxyl-terminal Tudor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>, followed by a fifth partial SN sequence (Tsn). In plants, it confers stress tolerance, is a component of stress granules and P-bodies, and may participate in stabilizing and localizing RNAs to specific sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>s of the cortical-endoplasmic reticulum in developing rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm. Here, we show that, in addition to the intact rice OsTudor-SN protein, the 4SN and Tsn modules exist as independent polypeptides, which collectively may coassemble to form a complex population of homodimer and heteroduplex species. The 4SN and Tsn modules exhibit different roles in RNA binding and as a protein scaffold for stress-associated proteins and RNA-binding proteins. Despite their distinct individual properties, mutations in both the 4SN and Tsn modules mislocalize storage protein mRNAs to the cortical endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that the two modular peptide regions of OsTudor-SN confer different cellular properties but cooperate in mRNA localization, a process linking its multiple functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to transfer their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing carotenoid transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase 1 Is Regulated by Its N-Terminal Domain in Response to Allosteric Effectors
<p>Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is an integral membrane enzyme catalyzing the final and committed step in the acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent biosynthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). The biochemical regulation of TAG assembly remains one of the least understood areas of primary metabolism to date. Here, we report that the hydrophilic N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of <i>Brassica napus</i> DGAT1 (BnaDGAT1<sub>1-113</sub>) regulates activity based on acyl-CoA/CoA levels. The N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> is not necessary for acyltransferase activity and is composed of an intrinsically disordered region and a folded segment. We show that the disordered region has an autoinhibitory function and a dimerization interface, which appears to mediate positive cooperativity, whereas the folded segment of the cytosolic region was found to have an allosteric site for acyl-CoA/CoA. Under increasing acyl-CoA levels, the binding of acyl-CoA with this noncatalytic site facilitates homotropic allosteric activation. Enzyme activation, on the other hand, is prevented under limiting acyl-CoA conditions (low acyl-CoA-to-CoA ratio), whereby CoA acts as a noncompetitive feedback inhibitor through interaction with the same folded segment. The three-dimensional NMR solution structure of the allosteric site revealed an α-helix with a loop connecting a coil fragment. The conserved amino acid residues in the loop interacting with CoA were identified, revealing details of this important regulatory element for allosteric regulation. Based on these results, a model is proposed illustrating the role of the N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> of BnaDGAT1 as a positive and negative modulator of TAG biosynthesis.</p>

<i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> Encode Putative H3K4 Methyltransferases and Are Critical for Plant Development
<p>Methylation of Lys residues in the tail of the H3 histone is a key regulator of chromatin state and gene expression, conferred by a large family of enzymes containing an evolutionarily conserved SET <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong>. One of the main types of SET <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> proteins are those controlling H3K4 di- and trimethylation. The genome of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes 12 such proteins, including five ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX (ATX) proteins and seven ATX-Related proteins. Here, we examined three until-now-unexplored ATX proteins, ATX3, ATX4, and ATX5. We found that they exhibit similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">domain</span></strong> structures and expression patterns and are redundantly required for vegetative and reproductive development. Concurrent disruption of the <i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> genes caused marked reduction in H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels genome-wide and resulted in thousands of genes expressed ectopically. Furthermore, <i>atx3</i>/<i>atx4</i>/<i>atx5</i> triple mutants resulted in exaggerated phenotypes when combined with the <i>atx2</i> mutant but not with <i>atx1</i>. Together, we conclude that <i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> are redundantly required for H3K4 di- and trimethylation at thousands of sites located across the genome, and genomic features associated with targeted regions are different from the <i>ATXR3</i>/<i>SDG2</i>-controlled sites in Arabidopsis.</p>

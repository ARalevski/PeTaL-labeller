Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial component fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

As peri-apatite (PA)   is solution deposited, this may increase the coverage of the implant   surface and thereby fixation.

In 60   patients (30 in each group), radiostereometric analysis of tibial   component migration was evaluated as the primary outcome at baseline,   three months post-operatively and at one, two and five years. A   linear mixed-effects model was used to analyse the repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After five years of follow-up, one (cemented) component was revised   due to ligament instability. Overall, uncemented PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial   components migrated significantly more    (p = 0.003), with the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) at   five years being 0.62 mm (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to   0.76) for cemented tibial components and 0.97 mm (95% CI 0.81 to   1.15) for PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial components in TKA. However, between three   months and five years the cemented TKAs migrated significantly more   (p = 0.02), displaying a MTPM of 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.36) <i>versus</i> 0.13   mm (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.25) for PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial components. One implant   in each group was considered at risk for aseptic loosening due to continuous   migration after five years of follow-up, albeit with different migration   patterns for each group (i.e. higher initial migration but diminishing   over time for the PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed component <i>versus</i> gradually   increasing migration for the cemented component).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The tibial components of PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed TKAs showed more overall migration   compared with the tibial components of cemented TKAs.

Tough adhesives for diverse wet surfaces
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion to wet and dynamic surfaces, including biological tissues, is important in many fields but has proven to be extremely challenging. Existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives are cytotoxic, adhere weakly to tissues, or cannot be used in wet environments. We report a bioinspired design for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives consisting of two layers: an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive surface and a dissipative matrix. The former adheres to the substrate by electrostatic interactions, covalent bonds, and physical interpenetration. The latter amplifies energy dissipation through hysteresis. The two layers synergistically lead to higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion energies on wet surfaces as compared with those of existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion occurs within minutes, independent of blood exposure and compatible with in vivo dynamic movements. This family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives may be useful in many areas of application, including tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives, wound dressings, and tissue repair.</p>

Tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices pinch collagen fibers to support 3D cell migration
<p>Migrating cells often use focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ions in order to move. Focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ions are less prominent in cells migrating in three-dimensional (3D) as compared with 2D environments. We looked for alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion structures supporting cell migration. We analyzed the dynamics of clathrin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed pits in cells migrating in a 3D environment of collagen fibers. Both topological cues and local engagement of integrins triggered the accumulation of clathrin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed structures on fibers. Clathrin/adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) lattices pinched collagen fibers by adopting a tube-like morphology and regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion to fibers in an endocytosis-independent manner. During migration, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices stabilized cellular protrusions by providing anchoring points to collagen fibers. Thus, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices promote cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion that, in coordination with focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ions, supports cell migration in 3D.</p>

Preventing mussel adhesion using lubricant-infused materials
<p>Mussels are opportunistic macrofouling organisms that can attach to most immersed solid surfaces, leading to serious economic and ecological consequences for the maritime and aquaculture industries. We demonstrate that lubricant-infused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ings exhibit very low preferential mussel attachment and ultralow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive strengths under both controlled laboratory conditions and in marine field studies. Detailed investigations across multiple length scales—from the molecular-scale characterization of deposited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive proteins to nanoscale contact mechanics to macroscale live observations—suggest that lubricant infusion considerably reduces fouling by deceiving the mechanosensing ability of mussels, deterring secretion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive threads, and decreasing the molecular work of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion. Our study demonstrates that lubricant infusion represents an effective strategy to mitigate marine biofouling and provides insights into the physical mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion prevention.</p>

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the seed mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole seed. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage formation.</p>

RhoB controls the Rab11-mediated recycling and surface reappearance of LFA-1 in migrating T lymphocytes
<p>The regulation of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and motility is complex and requires the intracellular trafficking of integrins to and from sites of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion, especially in fast-moving cells such as leukocytes. The Rab family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) is essential for vesicle transport, and vesicles mediate intracellular integrin trafficking. We showed that RhoB regulates the vesicular transport of the integrin LFA-1 along the microtubule network in migrating T lymphocytes. Impairment in RhoB function resulted in the accumulation of both LFA-1 and the recycling endosomal marker Rab11 at the rear of migrating T lymphocytes and decreased the association between these molecules. T lymphocytes lacking functional RhoB exhibited impaired recycling and subsequently decreased surface amounts of LFA-1, leading to reduced T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and migration mediated by the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion molecule ICAM-1 (intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion molecule–1). We propose that vesicle-associated RhoB is a regulator of the Rab11-mediated recycling of LFA-1 to the cell surface, an event that is necessary for T lymphocyte motility.</p>

The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 promotes T cell adhesion by activating the adaptor protein CrkII in the immunological synapse
<p>The adaptor protein CrkII regulates T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion by recruiting the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, an activator of Rap1. Subsequently, Rap1 stimulates the integrin LFA-1, which leads to T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion of T cells to APCs is critical for their proper function and education. The interface between the T cell and the APC is known as the immunological synapse. It is characterized by the specific organization of proteins that can be divided into central supramolecular activation clusters (c-SMACs) and peripheral SMACs (p-SMACs). Through total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and experiments with supported lipid bilayers, we determined that activated Rap1 was recruited to the immunological synapse and localized to the p-SMAC. C3G and the active (dephosphorylated) form of CrkII also localized to the same compartment. In contrast, inactive (phosphorylated) CrkII was confined to the c-SMAC. Activation of CrkII and its subsequent movement from the c-SMAC to the p-SMAC depended on the phosphatase SHP-1, which acted downstream of the T cell receptor. In the p-SMAC, CrkII recruited C3G, which led to Rap1 activation and LFA-1–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion of T cells to APCs. Functionally, SHP-1 was necessary for both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and migration of T cells. Together, these data highlight a signaling pathway in which SHP-1 acts through CrkII to reshape the pattern of Rap1 activation in the immunological synapse.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, represents an essential sealing component controlling water and solute movement and protecting seed from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components controlling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator controlling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during seed development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

Cathepsin G Controls Arterial But Not Venular Myeloid Cell Recruitment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Therapeutic targeting of arterial leukocyte recruitment in the context of atherosclerosis has been disappointing in clinical studies.

Consequently, CatG deficiency attenuates atherosclerosis but not acute lung inflammation. Mechanistically, CatG is immobilized on arterial endothelium where it activates leukocytes to firmly adhere engaging integrin clustering, a process of crucial importance to achieve effective adherence under high-shear flow. Therapeutic neutralization of CatG specifically abrogated arterial leukocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion without affecting myeloid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion in the microcirculation.

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>s, and their expression requires seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

A dynamic cell adhesion surface regulates tissue architecture in growth plate cartilage
<p>The architecture and morphogenetic properties of tissues are founded in the tissue-specific regulation of cell behaviors. In endochondral bones, the growth plate cartilage promotes bone elongation via regulated chondrocyte maturation within an ordered, three-dimensional cell array. A key event in the process that generates this cell array is the transformation of disordered resting chondrocytes into clonal columns of discoid proliferative cells aligned with the primary growth vector. Previous analysis showed that column-forming chondrocytes display planar cell divisions, and the resulting daughter cells rearrange by ∼90° to align with the lengthening column. However, these previous studies provided limited information about the mechanisms underlying this dynamic process. Here we present new mechanistic insights generated by application of a novel time-lapse confocal microscopy method along with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We show that, during cell division, daughter chondrocytes establish a cell-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion surface enriched in cadherins and β-catenin. Rearrangement into columns occurs concomitant with expansion of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion surface in a process more similar to cell spreading than to migration. Column formation requires cell-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion, as reducing cadherin binding via chelation of extracellular calcium inhibits chondrocyte rearrangement. Importantly, physical indicators of cell polarity, such as cell body alignment, are not prerequisites for oriented cell behavior. Our results support a model in which regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive surface dynamics and cortical tension by extrinsic signaling modifies the thermodynamic landscape to promote organization of daughter cells in the context of the three-dimensional growth plate tissue.</p>

CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart disease is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV disease (MVD), the cellular and molecular pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory molecules from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion molecule very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart disease valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative molecules including arginase-1 and resistin-like molecule α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion molecule–1.

We report the results of 2 studies investigating the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of a new DCB to treat femoropopliteal disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study (Prospective, Randomized, Single-Blind, U.S. Multi-Center Study to Evaluate Treatment of Obstructive Superficial Femoral Artery or Popliteal Lesions With A Novel Paclitaxel-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed Percutaneous Angioplasty Balloon), 300 symptomatic patients (Rutherford class 2–4) were randomly assigned to DCB (n=200) or standard angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA]) (n=100). The primary safety end point was freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days, and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months. The primary effectiveness end point was primary patency through 12 months. In the ILLUMENATE PK study (Pharmacokinetic Study of the Stellarex Drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed Angioplasty Balloon), paclitaxel plasma concentrations were measured after last DCB deployment and at prespecified times (at 1, 4, 24 hours and at 7 and 14 days postprocedure) until no longer detectable.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study, baseline characteristics were similar between groups: 50% had diabetes mellitus, 41% were women, mean lesion length was 8.3 cm, and 44% were severely calcified. The primary safety end point was met (92.1% for DCB versus 83.2% for PTA, <i>P</i>=0.025 for superiority) and the primary patency rate was significantly higher with DCB (76.3% for DCB versus 57.6% for PTA, <i>P</i>=0.003). Primary patency per Kaplan-Meier estimates at day 365 was 82.3% for DCB versus 70.9% for PTA (<i>P</i>=0.002). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was significantly lower in the DCB cohort (7.9% versus 16.8%, <i>P</i>=0.023). Improvements in ankle-brachial index, Rutherford class, and quality of life were comparable, but the PTA cohort required twice as many revascularizations.

An intramembrane sensory circuit monitors sortase A–mediated processing of streptococcal adhesins
<p>Bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ins mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion to substrates and biofilm formation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ins of the LPXTG family are posttranslationally processed by the cell membrane–localized peptidase sortase A, which cleaves the LPXTG motif. This generates a short C-terminal peptide (C-pep) that remains in the cell membrane, whereas the mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>in is incorporated into the cell wall. Genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ins of the oral bacterium <i>Streptococcus gordonii</i> were differentially expressed depending on whether the bacteria were isolated from saliva or dental plaque and appeared to be coordinately regulated. Deletion of <i>sspA</i> and <i>sspB (sspAB)</i>, both of which encode LPXTG-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ins, unexpectedly enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and biofilm formation. C-peps produced from a model LPXTG-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>in localized to the cell membrane and bound to and inhibited the intramembrane sensor histidine kinase SGO_1180, thus preventing activation of the cognate response regulator SGO_1181. The absence of SspAB C-peps induced the expression of the <i>scaCBA</i> operon encoding the lipoprotein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>in ScaA, which was sufficient to preserve and even enhance biofilm formation. This C-pep–driven regulatory circuit also exists in pathogenic streptococci and is likely conserved among Gram-positive bacteria. This quality control mechanism ensures that the bacteria can form biofilms under diverse environmental conditions and may play a role in optimizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and biofilm formation.</p>

Extension of chemotactic pseudopods by nonadherent human neutrophils does not require or cause calcium bursts
<p>Global bursts in free intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are among the most conspicuous signaling events in immune cells. To test the common view that Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts mediate rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in response to the activation of G protein–coupled receptors, we combined single-cell manipulation with fluorescence imaging and monitored the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in individual human neutrophils during complement-mediated chemotaxis. By decoupling purely chemotactic pseudopod formation from cell-substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion, we showed that physiological concentrations of anaphylatoxins, such as C5a, induced nonadherent human neutrophils to form chemotactic pseudopods but did not elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts. By contrast, pathological or supraphysiological concentrations of C5a often triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts, but pseudopod protrusion stalled or reversed in such cases, effectively halting chemotaxis, similar to sepsis-associated neutrophil paralysis. The maximum increase in cell surface area during pseudopod extension in pure chemotaxis was much smaller—by a factor of 8—than the known capacity of adherent human neutrophils to expand their surface. Because the measured rise in cortical tension was not sufficient to account for this difference, we attribute the limited deformability to a reduced ability of the cytoskeleton to generate protrusive force in the absence of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion. Thus, we hypothesize that Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts in neutrophils control a mechanistic switch between two distinct modes of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics. A key element of this switch appears to be the expedient coordination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion-dependent lock or release events of cytoskeletal membrane anchors.</p>

Adaptive introgression underlies polymorphic seasonal camouflage in snowshoe hares
<p>Snowshoe hares (<i>Lepus americanus</i>) maintain seasonal camouflage by molting to a white winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, but some hares remain brown during the winter in regions with low snow cover. We show that cis-regulatory variation controlling seasonal expression of the <i>Agouti</i> gene underlies this adaptive winter camouflage polymorphism. Genetic variation at <i>Agouti</i> clustered by winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> color across multiple hare and jackrabbit species, revealing a history of recurrent interspecific gene flow. Brown winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>s in snowshoe hares likely originated from an introgressed black-tailed jackrabbit allele that has swept to high frequency in mild winter environments. These discoveries show that introgression of genetic variants that underlie key ecological traits can seed past and ongoing adaptation to rapidly changing environments.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

<i>chaoptin</i>, <i>prominin</i>, <i>eyes shut</i> and <i>crumbs</i> form a genetic network controlling the apical compartment of <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptor cells
<p>The apical surface of epithelial cells is often highly specialised to fulfil cell type-specific functions. Many epithelial cells expand their apical surface by forming microvilli, actin-based, finger-like membrane protrusions. The apical surface of <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptor cells (PRCs) forms tightly packed microvilli, which are organised into the photosensitive rhabdomeres. As previously shown, the GPI-anchored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion protein Chaoptin is required for the stability of the microvilli, whereas the transmembrane protein Crumbs is essential for proper rhabdomere morphogenesis. Here we show that <i>chaoptin</i> synergises with <i>crumbs</i> to ensure optimal rhabdomere width. In addition, reduction of <i>crumbs</i> ameliorates morphogenetic defects observed in PRCs mutant for <i>prominin</i> and <i>eyes shut</i>, known antagonists of <i>chaoptin</i>. These results suggest that these four genes provide a balance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and anti-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion to maintain microvilli development and maintenance. Similar to <i>crumbs</i> mutant PRCs, PRCs devoid of <i>prominin</i> or <i>eyes shut</i> undergo light-dependent retinal degeneration. Given the observation that human orthologues of <i>crumbs</i>, <i>prominin</i> and <i>eyes shut</i> result in progressive retinal degeneration and blindness, the <i>Drosophila</i> eye is ideally suited to unravel the genetic and cellular mechanisms that ensure morphogenesis of PRCs and their maintenance under light-mediated stress.</p>

A SAP domain-containing protein shuttles between the nucleus and cell membranes and plays a role in adhesion and migration in <i>D. discoideum</i>
<p>The AmpA protein reduces cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion, thereby influencing cell migration in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. To understand how <i>ampA</i> influences cell migration, second site suppressors of an AmpA overexpressing cell line were created by REMI mutagenesis. Mutant candidates were identified by their ability to suppress the large plaques that the AmpA overexpressing cells form on bacterial lawns as a result of their increased rate of migration. One suppressor gene, <i>sma</i>, encodes an uncharacterized protein, which contains a SAP DNA-binding domain and a PTEN-like domain. Using <i>sma</i> gene knockouts and Sma-mRFP expressing cell lines, a role for <i>sma</i> in influencing cell migration was uncovered. Knockouts of the <i>sma</i> gene in a wild-type background enhanced chemotaxis. An additional role for Sma in influencing cell–cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion was also demonstrated. Sma protein transitions between cytosolic and nuclear localizations as a function of cell density. In growing cells migrating to folic acid it is localized to regions of actin polymerization and absent from the nucleus. A role for Sma in influencing <i>ampA</i> mRNA levels is also demonstrated. Sma additionally appears to be involved in <i>ampA</i> pathways regulating cell size, actin polymerization, and cell substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion. We present insights to the SAP domain-containing group of proteins in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and provide evidence of a role for a SAP domain-containing protein shuttling from the nucleus to sites of actin polymerization during chemotaxis to folic acid and influencing the efficiency of migration.</p>

CD13 tethers the IQGAP1-ARF6-EFA6 complex to the plasma membrane to promote ARF6 activation, β1 integrin recycling, and cell migration
<p>Cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) requires a balance between integrin internalization and recycling to the surface that is mediated by numerous proteins, emphasizing the complexity of these processes. Upon ligand binding in various cells, the β1 integrin is internalized, traffics to early endosomes, and is returned to the plasma membrane through recycling endosomes. This trafficking process depends on the cyclical activation and inactivation of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) by their specific guanine exchange factors (GEFs) and their GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). In this study, we found that the cell surface antigen CD13, a multifunctional transmembrane molecule that regulates cell-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and receptor-mediated endocytosis, also promoted cell migration and colocalized with β1 integrin at sites of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and at the leading edge. A lack of CD13 resulted in aberrant trafficking of internalized β1 integrin to late endosomes and its ultimate degradation. Our data indicate that CD13 promoted ARF6 GTPase activity by positioning the ARF6-GEF EFA6 at the cell membrane. In migrating cells, a complex containing phosphorylated CD13, IQGAP1, GTP-bound (active) ARF6, and EFA6 at the leading edge promoted the ARF6 GTPase cycling and cell migration. Together, our findings uncover a role for CD13 in the fundamental cellular processes of receptor recycling, regulation of small GTPase activities, cell-ECM interactions, and cell migration.</p>

Cadherin-11–mediated adhesion of macrophages to myofibroblasts establishes a profibrotic niche of active TGF-β
<p>Macrophages contribute to the activation of fibroblastic cells into myofibroblasts, which secrete collagen and contract the collagen matrix to acutely repair injured tissue. Persistent myofibroblast activation leads to the accumulation of fibrotic scar tissue that impairs organ function. We investigated the key processes that turn acute beneficial repair into destructive progressive fibrosis. We showed that homotypic cadherin-11 interactions promoted the specific binding of macrophages to and persistent activation of profibrotic myofibroblasts. Cadherin-11 was highly abundant at contacts between macrophages and myofibroblasts in mouse and human fibrotic lung tissues. In attachment assays, cadherin-11 junctions mediated specific recognition and strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion between macrophages and myofibroblasts. One functional outcome of cadherin-11–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion was locally restricted activation of latent transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) between macrophage-myofibroblast pairs that was not observed in cocultures of macrophages and myofibroblasts that were not in contact with one another. Our data suggest that cadherin-11 junctions maintain latent TGF-β–producing macrophages and TGF-β–activating myofibroblasts in close proximity to one another. Inhibition of homotypic cadherin-11 interactions could be used to cause macrophage-myofibroblast separation, thereby destabilizing the profibrotic niche.</p>

Low–interfacial toughness materials for effective large-scale deicing

This imparts a scalability limit to the use of icephobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ings for structures with large surface areas, such as power lines or ship hulls. We describe a class of materials that exhibit a low interfacial toughness with ice, resulting in systems for which the forces required to remove large areas of ice (a few square centimeters or greater) are both low and independent of the iced area. We further demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ings made of such materials allow ice to be shed readily from large areas (~1 square meter) merely by self-weight.</p>

<p>The human body absorbs and loses heat largely through infrared radiation centering around a wavelength of 10 micrometers. However, neither our skin nor the textiles that make up clothing are capable of dynamically controlling this optical channel for thermal management. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing triacetate-cellulose bimorph fibers with a thin layer of carbon nanotubes, we effectively modulated the infrared radiation by more than 35% as the relative humidity of the underlying skin changed. Both experiments and modeling suggest that this dynamic infrared gating effect mainly arises from distance-dependent electromagnetic coupling between neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed fibers in the textile yarns. This effect opens a pathway for developing wearable localized thermal management systems that are autonomous and self-powered, as well as expanding our ability to adapt to demanding environments.</p>

Templated nanofiber synthesis via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystalline films
<p>Extrusion, electrospinning, and microdrawing are widely used to create fibrous polymer mats, but these approaches offer limited access to oriented arrays of nanometer-scale fibers with controlled size, shape, and lateral organization. We show that chemical vapor polymerization can be performed on surfaces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed with thin films of liquid crystals to synthesize organized assemblies of end-attached polymer nanofibers. The process uses low concentrations of radical monomers formed initially in the vapor phase and then diffused into the liquid-crystal template. This minimizes monomer-induced changes to the liquid-crystal phase and enables access to nanofiber arrays with complex yet precisely defined structures and compositions. The nanofiber arrays permit tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion that depends on nanofiber chirality.</p>

Lectins modulate the microbiota of social amoebae
<p>The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> maintains a microbiome during multicellular development; bacteria are carried in migrating slugs and as endosymbionts within amoebae and spores. Bacterial carriage and endosymbiosis are induced by the secreted lectin discoidin I that binds bacteria, protects them from extracellular killing, and alters their retention within amoebae. This altered handling of bacteria also occurs with bacteria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed by plant lectins and leads to DNA transfer from bacteria to amoebae. Thus, lectins alter the cellular response of <i>D. discoideum</i> to bacteria to establish the amoebae’s microbiome. Mammalian cells can also maintain intracellular bacteria when presented with bacteria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed with lectins, so heterologous lectins may induce endosymbiosis in animals. Our results suggest that endogenous or environmental lectins may influence microbiome homeostasis across eukaryotic phylogeny.</p>

Winter color polymorphisms identify global hot spots for evolutionary rescue from climate change
<p>Maintenance of biodiversity in a rapidly changing climate will depend on the efficacy of evolutionary rescue, whereby population declines due to abrupt environmental change are reversed by shifts in genetically driven adaptive traits. However, a lack of traits known to be under direct selection by anthropogenic climate change has limited the incorporation of evolutionary processes into global conservation efforts. In 21 vertebrate species, some individuals undergo a seasonal color molt from summer brown to winter white as camouflage against snow, whereas other individuals remain brown. Seasonal snow duration is decreasing globally, and fitness is lower for winter white animals on snowless backgrounds. Based on 2713 georeferenced samples of known winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> color—from eight species across trophic levels—we identify environmentally driven clinal gradients in winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> color, including polymorphic zones where winter brown and white morphs co-occur. These polymorphic zones, underrepresented by existing global protected area networks, indicate hot spots for evolutionary rescue in a changing climate.</p>

Volatile chemical products emerging as largest petrochemical source of urban organic emissions
<p>A gap in emission inventories of urban volatile organic compound (VOC) sources, which contribute to regional ozone and aerosol burdens, has increased as transportation emissions in the United States and Europe have declined rapidly. A detailed mass balance demonstrates that the use of volatile chemical products (VCPs)—including pesticides, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ings, printing inks, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives, cleaning agents, and personal care products—now constitutes half of fossil fuel VOC emissions in industrialized cities. The high fraction of VCP emissions is consistent with observed urban outdoor and indoor air measurements. We show that human exposure to carbonaceous aerosols of fossil origin is transitioning away from transportation-related sources and toward VCPs. Existing U.S. regulations on VCPs emphasize mitigating ozone and air toxics, but they currently exempt many chemicals that lead to secondary organic aerosols.</p>

Vinculin forms a directionally asymmetric catch bond with F-actin
<p>Vinculin is an actin-binding protein thought to reinforce cell-cell and cell-matrix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ions. However, how mechanical load affects the vinculin–F-actin bond is unclear. Using a single-molecule optical trap assay, we found that vinculin forms a force-dependent catch bond with F-actin through its tail domain, but with lifetimes that depend strongly on the direction of the applied force. Force toward the pointed (–) end of the actin filament resulted in a bond that was maximally stable at 8 piconewtons, with a mean lifetime (12 seconds) 10 times as long as the mean lifetime when force was applied toward the barbed (+) end. A computational model of lamellipodial actin dynamics suggests that the directionality of the vinculin–F-actin bond could establish long-range order in the actin cytoskeleton. The directional and force-stabilized binding of vinculin to F-actin may be a mechanism by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion complexes maintain front-rear asymmetry in migrating cells.</p>

Improving efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells with photocurable fluoropolymers

3D Imaging of Tapetal Mitochondria Suggests the Importance of Mitochondrial Fission in Pollen Growth
<p>Mitochondrial fission occurs frequently in plant cells, but its biological significance is poorly understood because mutants specifically impaired in mitochondrial fission do not show obvious defects in vegetative growth. Here, we revealed that the production of viable pollen was reduced in mutants lacking one of the three main proteins involved in mitochondrial fission in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3A (DRP3A)/Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-LIKE PROTEIN2A, DRP3B, and ELONGATED MITOCHONDRIA1 (ELM1). In <i>drp3b</i> and <i>elm1</i>, young microspores contained an abnormal number of nuclei, and mature pollen had aberrant accumulation of lipids in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> and an irregular pollen outer wall. Because the formation of the pollen wall and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> is mainly associated with tapetal function, we used 3D imaging to quantify geometric and textural features of cells and mitochondria in the tapetum at different stages, using isolated single tapetal cells in which the in vivo morphology and volume of cells and mitochondria were preserved. Tapetal cells and their mitochondria changed in the volume and morphology at different developmental stages. Defective mitochondrial fission in the <i>elm1</i> and <i>drp3b</i> mutants caused changes in mitochondrial status, including mitochondrial elongation, abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure, a decrease in cross-sectional area, and a slight alteration of mitochondrial distribution, as well as a large reduction in mitochondrial density. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial fission is required for proper mitochondrial status in the tapetum and possibly in pollen as well and therefore plays an important role for the production of viable pollen.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion of plant cells is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between cell wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant cells are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border cells are examples of this. Border cells (in some species known as border-like cells) provide an expendable barrier between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized cell separation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex cellular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip cell walls. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of cell wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of cell wall components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified multiple novel modes of cell wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border cells. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border cell maturation and enable us to develop a model of the separation process. We propose that loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of cell curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

Awake1, an ABC-Type Transporter, Reveals an Essential Role for Suberin in the Control of Seed Dormancy
<p>The mother plant plays an important dynamic role in the control of dormancy of her progeny seed in response to environmental signals. In order to further understand the mechanisms by which this dormancy control takes place in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we conducted a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants that fail to enter dormancy in response to variation in temperature during seed set. We show that, for the first of these mutants, designated <i>awake1</i>, the maternal allele is required for entry into strongly dormant states and that <i>awake1</i> mutants show seed phenotypes shown previously to be associated with the loss of suberin in the seed. We identify <i>awake1</i> as an allele of <i>ABCG20</i>, an ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene required for the transport of fatty acids during suberin deposition, and show that further suberin-deficient mutants have seed dormancy defects. Seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin composition is affected by temperature during seed maturation, but this response appears to be independent of ABCG20. We conclude that seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin is essential for seed dormancy imposition by low temperature and that the exclusion of oxygen and water from the seed by the suberin and tannin layers is important for dormancy imposition.</p>

MONENSIN SENSITIVITY1 (MON1)/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-Mediated Rab7 Activation Regulates Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD)-triggered degradation of plant tapetum is essential for microspore development and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> formation; however, little is known about the cellular mechanism regulating tapetal PCD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab7-mediated vacuolar transport of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases is crucial for tapetal PCD and pollen development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with the following evidence: (1) The <i>monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>mon1</i>) mutants, which are defective in Rab7 activation, showed impaired male fertility due to a combined defect in both tapetum and male gametophyte development. (2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and pollen. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> formation and decreased male fertility. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-mediated Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-mediated vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in defective pollen germination and tube growth. Taken together, tapetal PCD and pollen development require successful MON1/CCZ1-mediated vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) Regulates Cell Walls in the Leaf Epidermis
<p>The plant epidermis is crucial to survival, regulating interactions with the environment and controlling plant growth. The phytocalpain DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) is a master regulator of epidermal differentiation and maintenance, acting upstream of epidermis-specific transcription factors, and is required for correct cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion. It is currently unclear how changes in DEK1 lead to cellular defects in the epidermis and the pathways through which DEK1 acts. We have combined growth kinematic studies, cell wall analysis, and transcriptional analysis of genes downstream of DEK1 to determine the cause of phenotypic changes observed in DEK1-modulated lines of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We reveal a novel role for DEK1 in the regulation of leaf epidermal cell wall structure. Lines with altered DEK1 activity have epidermis-specific changes in the thickness and polysaccharide composition of cell walls that likely underlie the loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion between epidermal cells in plants with reduced levels of DEK1 and changes in leaf shape and size in plants constitutively overexpressing the active CALPAIN domain of DEK1. Calpain-overexpressing plants also have increased levels of cellulose and pectins in epidermal cell walls, and this is correlated with the expression of several cell wall-related genes, linking transcriptional regulation downstream of DEK1 with cellular effects. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the role of the epidermal cell walls in growth regulation and establish a new role for DEK1 in pathways regulating epidermal cell wall deposition and remodeling.</p>

EphA2 Expression Regulates Inflammation and Fibroproliferative Remodeling in Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerotic plaque formation results from chronic inflammation and fibroproliferative remodeling in the vascular wall. We previously demonstrated that both human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques show elevated expression of EphA2, a guidance molecule involved in cell-cell interactions and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we assessed the role of EphA2 in atherosclerosis by deleting EphA2 in a mouse model of atherosclerosis (Apoe<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup>) and by assessing EphA2 function in multiple vascular cell culture models. After 8 to 16 weeks on a Western diet, male and female mice were assessed for atherosclerotic burden in the large vessels, and plasma lipid levels were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Despite enhanced weight gain and plasma lipid levels compared with Apoe<sup>−/−</sup> controls, EphA2<sup>−/−</sup>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup> knockout mice show diminished atherosclerotic plaque formation, characterized by reduced proinflammatory gene expression and plaque macrophage content. Although plaque macrophages express EphA2, EphA2 deletion does not affect macrophage phenotype, inflammatory responses, and lipid uptake, and bone marrow chimeras suggest that hematopoietic EphA2 deletion does not affect plaque formation. In contrast, endothelial EphA2 knockdown significantly reduces monocyte firm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion under flow. In addition, EphA2<sup>−/−</sup>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup> mice show reduced progression to advanced atherosclerotic plaques with diminished smooth muscle and collagen content.

Enhanced Therapeutic and Long-Term Dynamic Vascularization Effects of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Endothelial Cells Encapsulated in a Nanomatrix Gel
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)–derived endothelial cells (ECs) have limited clinical utility because of undefined components in the differentiation system and poor cell survival in vivo. Here, we aimed to develop a fully defined and clinically compatible system to differentiate hPSCs into ECs. Furthermore, we aimed to enhance cell survival, vessel formation, and therapeutic potential by encapsulating hPSC-ECs with a peptide amphiphile (PA) nanomatrix gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We induced differentiation of hPSCs into the mesodermal lineage by culturing on collagen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed plates with a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor. Next, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor were added for endothelial lineage differentiation, followed by sorting for CDH5 (VE-cadherin). We constructed an extracellular matrix–mimicking PA nanomatrix gel (PA-RGDS) by incorporating the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive ligand Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) and a matrix metalloproteinase-2–degradable sequence. We then evaluated whether the encapsulation of hPSC-CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells in PA-RGDS could enhance long-term cell survival and vascular regenerative effects in a hind-limb ischemia model with laser Doppler perfusion imaging, bioluminescence imaging, real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The resultant hPSC-derived CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells (hPSC-ECs) showed highly enriched and genuine EC characteristics and proangiogenic activities. When injected into ischemic hind limbs, hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery and higher vessel-forming capacity compared with media-, PA-RGDS–, or human umbilical vein EC–injected groups. However, the group receiving the PA-RGDS–encapsulated hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery, more robust and longer cell survival (> 10 months), and higher and prolonged angiogenic and vascular incorporation capabilities than the bare hPSC-EC–injected group. Surprisingly, the engrafted hPSC-ECs demonstrated previously unknown sustained and dynamic vessel-forming behavior: initial perivascular concentration, a guiding role for new vessel formation, and progressive incorporation into the vessels over 10 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We generated highly enriched hPSC-ECs via a clinically compatible system.

This PA-RGDS–mediated transplantation of hPSC-ECs can serve as a novel platform for cell-based therapy and investigation of long-term behavior of hPSC-ECs.</p></sec>

Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p>Cell motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and cancer cell invasion. It is generally thought that migrating cells grab and exert traction force onto the extracellular matrix in order to pull the cell body forward. While previous studies have shown that myosin II deficient cells migrate efficiently, whether these cells exert traction forces during cell migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a force sensor and shRNA specific to each myosin II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how myosin IIA and IIB individually regulate cell migration and traction force generation. Myosin IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction force was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual myosin II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, myosin IIA deficient cells lost actin stress fibers and focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ions, whereas myosin IIB deficient cells maintained similar actin organization and focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ions as wild-type cells. Interestingly, myosin IIA deficient cells migrated faster than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet myosin IIA deficient cells exerted significantly less traction force at the leading edge than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells. These results suggest that, in the absence of myosin IIA mediated force-generating machinery, cells move with minimal traction forces at the cell periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of cells to adapt and migrate.</p>

Principles for designing proteins with cavities formed by curved β sheets
<p>Active sites and ligand-binding cavities in native proteins are often formed by curved β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s, and the ability to control β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> curvature would allow design of binding proteins with cavities customized to specific ligands. Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> curvature by studying the geometry of β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to design, de novo, a series of proteins with curved β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s topped with α helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the design of proteins with cavities and provides a route to custom design ligand-binding and catalytic sites.</p>

Slowdown in Antarctic mass loss from solid Earth and sea-level feedbacks
<p>Geodetic investigations of crustal motions in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica and models of ice-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> evolution in the past 10,000 years have recently highlighted the stabilizing role of solid-Earth uplift on polar ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s. One critical aspect, however, that has not been assessed is the impact of short-wavelength uplift generated by the solid-Earth response to unloading over short time scales close to ice-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> grounding lines (areas where the ice becomes afloat). Here, we present a new global simulation of Antarctic evolution at high spatiotemporal resolution that captures all solid Earth processes that affect ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s and show a projected negative feedback in grounding line migration of 38% for Thwaites Glacier 350 years in the future, or 26.8% reduction in corresponding sea-level contribution.</p>

Massive blow-out craters formed by hydrate-controlled methane expulsion from the Arctic seafloor
<p>Widespread methane release from thawing Arctic gas hydrates is a major concern, yet the processes, sources, and fluxes involved remain unconstrained. We present geophysical data documenting a cluster of kilometer-wide craters and mounds from the Barents Sea floor associated with large-scale methane expulsion. Combined with ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>/gas hydrate modeling, our results indicate that during glaciation, natural gas migrated from underlying hydrocarbon reservoirs and was sequestered extensively as subglacial gas hydrates. Upon ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> retreat, methane from this hydrate reservoir concentrated in massive mounds before being abruptly released to form craters. We propose that these processes were likely widespread across past glaciated petroleum provinces and that they also provide an analog for the potential future destabilization of subglacial gas hydrate reservoirs beneath contemporary ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s.</p>

Increased spatiotemporal resolution reveals highly dynamic dense tubular matrices in the peripheral ER
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an expansive, membrane-enclosed organelle that plays crucial roles in numerous cellular functions. We used emerging superresolution imaging technologies to clarify the morphology and dynamics of the peripheral ER, which contacts and modulates most other intracellular organelles. Peripheral components of the ER have classically been described as comprising both tubules and flat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s. We show that this system consists almost exclusively of tubules at varying densities, including structures that we term ER matrices. Conventional optical imaging technologies had led to misidentification of these structures as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s because of the dense clustering of tubular junctions and a previously uncharacterized rapid form of ER motion. The existence of ER matrices explains previous confounding evidence that had indicated the occurrence of ER “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>” proliferation after overexpression of tubular junction–forming proteins.</p>

Friction at the bed does not control fast glacier flow
<p>The largest uncertainty in the ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> models used to predict future sea level rise originates from our limited understanding of processes at the ice/bed interface. Near glacier termini, where basal sliding controls ice flow, most predictive ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> models use a parameterization of sliding that has been theoretically derived for glacier flow over a hard bed. We find that this sliding relation does not apply to the 140 Greenland glaciers that we analyzed. There is no relationship between basal sliding and frictional stress at the glacier bed, contrary to theoretical predictions. There is a strong relationship between sliding speed and net pressure at the glacier bed. This latter finding is in agreement with earlier observations of mountain glaciers that have been largely overlooked by the glaciological community.</p>

Wrapping with a splash: High-speed encapsulation with ultrathin sheets
<p>Many complex fluids rely on surfactants to contain, protect, or isolate liquid drops in an immiscible continuous phase. Thin elastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s can wrap liquid drops in a spontaneous process driven by capillary forces. For encapsulation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s to be practically viable, a rapid, continuous, and scalable process is essential. We exploit the fast dynamics of droplet impact to achieve wrapping of oil droplets by ultrathin polymer films in a water phase. Despite the violence of splashing events, the process robustly yields wrappings that are optimally shaped to maximize the enclosed fluid volume and have near-perfect seams. We achieve wrappings of targeted three-dimensional (3D) shapes by tailoring the 2D boundary of the films and show the generality of the technique by producing both oil-in-water and water-in-oil wrappings.</p>

Atomic structures of low-complexity protein segments reveal kinked β sheets that assemble networks
<p>Subcellular membraneless assemblies are a reinvigorated area of study in biology, with spirited scientific discussions on the forces between the low-complexity protein domains within these assemblies. To illuminate these forces, we determined the atomic structures of five segments from protein low-complexity domains associated with membraneless assemblies. Their common structural feature is the stacking of segments into kinked β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s that pair into protofilaments. Unlike steric zippers of amyloid fibrils, the kinked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s interact weakly through polar atoms and aromatic side chains. By computationally threading the human proteome on our kinked structures, we identified hundreds of low-complexity segments potentially capable of forming such interactions. These segments are found in proteins as diverse as RNA binders, nuclear pore proteins, and keratins, which are known to form networks and localize to membraneless assemblies.</p>

Cordilleran Ice Sheet mass loss preceded climate reversals near the Pleistocene Termination
<p>The Cordilleran Ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> (CIS) once covered an area comparable to that of Greenland. Previous geologic evidence and numerical models indicate that the ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> covered much of westernmost Canada as late as 12.5 thousand years ago (ka). New data indicate that substantial areas throughout westernmost Canada were ice free prior to 12.5 ka and some as early as 14.0 ka, with implications for climate dynamics and the timing of meltwater discharge to the Pacific and Arctic oceans. Early Bølling-Allerød warmth halved the mass of the CIS in as little as 500 years, causing 2.5 to 3.0 meters of sea-level rise. Dozens of cirque and valley glaciers, along with the southern margin of the CIS, advanced into recently deglaciated regions during the Bølling-Allerød and Younger Dryas.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Synaptotagmin-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum-Plasma Membrane Contact Sites Are Localized to Immobile ER Tubules
<p>The plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is morphologically divided into tubules and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s, seems to flow continuously as a whole, but locally, mobile and immobile regions exist. In eukaryotes, the ER physically and functionally interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) at domains called ER-PM contact sites (EPCSs). Extended synaptotagmin family proteins are concentrated in the cortical ER to form one type of EPCS; however, it is unclear whether the localization of extended synaptotagmin corresponds to the EPCS and where in the cortical ER the EPCSs are formed. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal localization of SYNAPTOTAGMIN1 (SYT1), a synaptotagmin in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), to investigate the precise distribution of SYT1-associated EPCSs in the cortical ER. Three-dimensional imaging using superresolution confocal live imaging microscopy demonstrated that SYT1 was specifically localized to the ER-PM boundary. Time-lapse imaging revealed that SYT1 was distributed to immobile ER tubules, but not to mobile tubules. Moreover, SYT1 was frequently localized to the edges of ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s that were transformed into immobile ER tubules over time. A lower intracellular calcium ion concentration resulted in an increased EPCS area and disrupted the ER network. Finally, SYT1 deficiency caused a reduction of the immobile tubules and enlargement of the ER meshes. Taken together, our findings show that SYT1-associated EPCS are distributed to immobile tubules and play an important role in the formation of the tubular ER network. This provides important insight into the relationship between the function and dynamics/morphology of the cortical ER.</p>

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular system (t-system) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-system in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-system structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-system. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-system remodeling, particularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-system components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-system density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-system density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-system density versus cells with high t-system density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-system in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-system impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-system at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after mechanical unloading.</p></sec>

All three IP<sub>3</sub> receptor isoforms generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs that display similar characteristics
<p>Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) evokes Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs) to generate both local Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs arising from concerted openings of clustered IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and cell-wide Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. Imaging Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs with single-channel resolution yields information on the localization and properties of native IP<sub>3</sub>Rs in intact cells, but interpretation has been complicated because cells express varying proportions of three structurally and functionally distinct isoforms of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs. Here, we used TIRF and light-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> microscopy to image Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs in HEK-293 cell lines generated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology to express exclusively IP<sub>3</sub>R type 1, 2, or 3. Photorelease of the IP<sub>3</sub> analog i-IP<sub>3</sub> in all three cell lines evoked puffs with largely similar mean amplitudes, temporal characteristics, and spatial extents. Moreover, the single-channel Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux was similar among isoforms, indicating that clusters of different IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms contain comparable numbers of active channels. Our results show that all three IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms cluster to generate local Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs and, contrary to findings of divergent properties from in vitro electrophysiological studies, display similar conductances and gating kinetics in intact cells.</p>

Arc-continent collisions in the tropics set Earth’s climate state
<p>On multimillion-year time scales, Earth has experienced warm ice-free and cold glacial climates, but it is unknown whether transitions between these background climate states were the result of changes in carbon dioxide sources or sinks. Low-latitude arc-continent collisions are hypothesized to drive cooling by exhuming and eroding mafic and ultramafic rocks in the warm, wet tropics, thereby increasing Earth’s potential to sequester carbon through chemical weathering. To better constrain global weatherability through time, the paleogeographic position of all major Phanerozoic arc-continent collisions was reconstructed and compared to the latitudinal distribution of ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s. This analysis reveals a strong correlation between the extent of glaciation and arc-continent collisions in the tropics. Earth’s climate state is set primarily by global weatherability, which changes with the latitudinal distribution of arc-continent collisions.</p>

Cortical column and whole-brain imaging with molecular contrast and nanoscale resolution

These included synaptic proteins at dendritic spines, myelination along axons, and presynaptic densities at dopaminergic neurons in every fly brain region. The technology should enable statistically rich, large-scale studies of neural development, sexual dimorphism, degree of stereotypy, and structural correlations to behavior or neural activity, all with molecular contrast.</p>

Mediator and RNA polymerase II clusters associate in transcription-dependent condensates
<p>Models of gene control have emerged from genetic and biochemical studies, with limited consideration of the spatial organization and dynamics of key components in living cells. We used live-cell superresolution and light-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> imaging to study the organization and dynamics of the Mediator coactivator and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) directly. Mediator and Pol II each form small transient and large stable clusters in living embryonic stem cells. Mediator and Pol II are colocalized in the stable clusters, which associate with chromatin, have properties of phase-separated condensates, and are sensitive to transcriptional inhibitors. We suggest that large clusters of Mediator, recruited by transcription factors at large or clustered enhancer elements, interact with large Pol II clusters in transcriptional condensates in vivo.</p>

Dual-spindle formation in zygotes keeps parental genomes apart in early mammalian embryos
<p>At the beginning of mammalian life, the genetic material from each parent meets when the fertilized egg divides. It was previously thought that a single microtubule spindle is responsible for spatially combining the two genomes and then segregating them to create the two-cell embryo. We used light-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> microscopy to show that two bipolar spindles form in the zygote and then independently congress the maternal and paternal genomes. These two spindles aligned their poles before anaphase but kept the parental genomes apart during the first cleavage. This spindle assembly mechanism provides a potential rationale for erroneous divisions into more than two blastomeric nuclei observed in mammalian zygotes and reveals the mechanism behind the observation that parental genomes occupy separate nuclear compartments in the two-cell embryo.</p>

Seeded growth of single-crystal two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks
<p>Polymerization of monomers into periodic two-dimensional networks provides structurally precise, layered macromolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s that exhibit desirable mechanical, optoelectronic, and molecular transport properties. Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) offer broad monomer scope but are generally isolated as powders comprising aggregated nanometer-scale crystallites. We found that 2D COF formation could be controlled using a two-step procedure in which monomers are added slowly to preformed nanoparticle seeds. The resulting 2D COFs are isolated as single-crystalline, micrometer-sized particles. Transient absorption spectroscopy of the dispersed COF nanoparticles revealed improvement in signal quality by two to three orders of magnitude relative to polycrystalline powder samples, and suggests exciton diffusion over longer length scales than those obtained through previous approaches. These findings should enable a broad exploration of synthetic 2D polymer structures and properties.</p>

Observed rapid bedrock uplift in Amundsen Sea Embayment promotes ice-sheet stability
<p>The marine portion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) accounts for one-fourth of the cryospheric contribution to global sea-level rise and is vulnerable to catastrophic collapse. The bedrock response to ice mass loss, glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), was thought to occur on a time scale of 10,000 years. We used new GPS measurements, which show a rapid (41 millimeters per year) uplift of the ASE, to estimate the viscosity of the mantle underneath. We found a much lower viscosity (4 × 10<sup>18</sup> pascal-second) than global average, and this shortens the GIA response time scale from tens to hundreds of years. Our finding requires an upward revision of ice mass loss from gravity data of 10% and increases the potential stability of the WAIS against catastrophic collapse.</p>

BAK/BAX macropores facilitate mitochondrial herniation and mtDNA efflux during apoptosis
<p>Mitochondrial apoptosis is mediated by BAK and BAX, two proteins that induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leading to cytochrome c release and activation of apoptotic caspases. In the absence of active caspases, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) triggers the innate immune cGAS/STING pathway, causing dying cells to secrete type I interferon. How cGAS gains access to mtDNA remains unclear. We used live-cell lattice light-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> microscopy to examine the mitochondrial network in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We found that after BAK/BAX activation and cytochrome c loss, the mitochondrial network broke down and large BAK/BAX pores appeared in the outer membrane. These BAK/BAX macropores allowed the inner mitochondrial membrane to herniate into the cytosol, carrying with it mitochondrial matrix components, including the mitochondrial genome. Apoptotic caspases did not prevent herniation but dismantled the dying cell to suppress mtDNA-induced innate immune signaling.</p>

Stretchable surfaces with programmable 3D texture morphing for synthetic camouflaging skins
<p>Technologies that use stretchable materials are increasingly important, yet we are unable to control how they stretch with much more sophistication than inflating balloons.

Inspired by cephalopod muscular morphology, we developed synthetic tissue groupings that allowed programmable transformation of two-dimensional (2D) stretchable surfaces into target 3D shapes. The synthetic tissue groupings consisted of elastomeric membranes embedded with inextensible textile mesh that inflated to within 10% of their target shapes by using a simple fabrication method and modeling approach.

Visualizing dynamic microvillar search and stabilization during ligand detection by T cells
<p>During immune surveillance, T cells survey the surface of antigen-presenting cells. In searching for peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs), they must solve a classic trade-off between speed and sensitivity. It has long been supposed that microvilli on T cells act as sensory organs to enable search, but their strategy has been unknown. We used lattice light-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> and quantum dot–enabled synaptic contact mapping microscopy to show that anomalous diffusion and fractal organization of microvilli survey the majority of opposing surfaces within 1 minute. Individual dwell times were long enough to discriminate pMHC half-lives and T cell receptor (TCR) accumulation selectively stabilized microvilli. Stabilization was independent of tyrosine kinase signaling and the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting selection for avid TCR microclusters. This work defines the efficient cellular search process against which ligand detection takes place.</p>

The cytotoxic <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> PSMα3 reveals a cross-α amyloid-like fibril
<p>Amyloids are ordered protein aggregates, found in all kingdoms of life, and are involved in aggregation diseases as well as in physiological activities. In microbes, functional amyloids are often key virulence determinants, yet the structural basis for their activity remains elusive. We determined the fibril structure and function of the highly toxic, 22-residue phenol-soluble modulin α3 (PSMα3) peptide secreted by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. PSMα3 formed elongated fibrils that shared the morphological and tinctorial characteristics of canonical cross-β eukaryotic amyloids. However, the crystal structure of full-length PSMα3, solved de novo at 1.45 angstrom resolution, revealed a distinctive “cross-α” amyloid-like architecture, in which amphipathic α helices stacked perpendicular to the fibril axis into tight self-associating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s. The cross-α fibrillation of PSMα3 facilitated cytotoxicity, suggesting that this assembly mode underlies function in <i>S. aureus</i>.</p>

Ocean mixing and ice-sheet control of seawater <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U during the last deglaciation
<p>Seawater <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U provides global-scale information about continental weathering and is vital for marine uranium-series geochronology. Existing evidence supports an increase in <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U since the last glacial period, but the timing and amplitude of its variability has been poorly constrained. Here we report two seawater <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U records based on well-preserved deep-sea corals from the low-latitude Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Atlantic <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U started to increase before major sea-level rise and overshot the modern value by 3 per mil during the early deglaciation. Deglacial <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U in the Pacific converged with that in the Atlantic after the abrupt resumption of Atlantic meridional overturning. We suggest that ocean mixing and early deglacial release of excess <sup>234</sup>U from enhanced subglacial melting of the Northern Hemisphere ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s have driven the observed <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U evolution.</p>

Marine Ice Sheet Collapse Potentially Under Way for the Thwaites Glacier Basin, West Antarctica
<sec><title>Antarctic Collapse</title><p>The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is particularly vulnerable to ocean warming-induced collapse. The Thwaites Glacier of West Antarctica is one of the largest WAIS regional contributors to sea level rise, and has been considered to be potentially unstable for many years. <bold>Joughin <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 735) used a combination of a numerical model and observations of its recent geometry and movement to investigate the stability of the Thwaites Glacier. The glacier has already entered the early stages of collapse, and rapid and irreversible collapse is likely in the next 200 to 1000 years.</p></sec>

Edge Nonlinear Optics on a MoS<sub>2</sub> Atomic Monolayer
<sec><title>Optics On the Edge</title><p>The ability to isolate stable materials just one atom thick has provided the impetus for a new generation of thin films technologies. Often, the materials are conceptually imaged in the form of an artist's impression as single continuous layers—a single crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong> of atoms. Scanning probe and transmission electron microscopies reveal the reality, however, where the material resembles a patchwork quilt with polycrystals of different orientation and size separated by grain boundaries forming a mosaic. These structures play an influential role in determining the transport and optical properties of the membrane. <bold>Yin <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 488; see the Perspective by <bold>Neshev and Kivshar</bold>) demonstrate a simple microscopy technique based on the nonlinear optical response of the materials to probe and characterize atomically thin layers of MoS<sub>2</sub>. The technique should prove useful during the characterization and optimization of atomically thin membranes.</p></sec>

Efficient ER Fusion Requires a Dimerization and a C-Terminal Tail Mediated Membrane Anchoring of RHD3
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of tubules and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s stretching throughout the eukaryotic cells. The formation of the ER requires homotypic membrane fusion, which is mediated by a family of Dynamin-like Atlastin GTPase proteins. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) member ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE3 (RHD3) has been demonstrated to mediate ER membrane fusion, but how exactly RHD3 is involved in the process is still unknown. Here we conducted systemic structure-function analyses of roles of different RHD3 domains in mediating ER fusion. We showed that efficient ER membrane fusion mediated by RHD3 requires a proper dimerization of RHD3 through the GTPase domain (GD) and the first and second three helix bundles (3HBs) in the middle domain. RHD3 has a 3HB-enriched middle domain longer than that of Atlastins, and we revealed that the third and fourth 3HBs are required for the stability of RHD3. The transmembrane segments of RHD3 are essential for targeting and retention of RHD3 in the ER and can also facilitate an oligomerization of RHD3. Furthermore, we showed that an amphipathic helix in the C-terminal cytosolic tail of RHD3 has a membrane anchoring ability that is required for efficient ER membrane fusion mediated by RHD3. This work contributes to a better understanding of a coordinated action of RHD3 in the fusion of ER membranes.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>s of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect development has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan development. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic development of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head development. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheet</span></strong>-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, developed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> development. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

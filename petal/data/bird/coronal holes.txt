A loud quasi-periodic oscillation after a star is disrupted by a massive black hole
<p>The tidal forces close to massive black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s can rip apart stars that come too close to them. As the resulting stellar debris spirals toward the black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>, the debris heats up and emits x-rays. We report observations of a stable 131-second x-ray quasi-periodic oscillation from the tidal disruption event ASASSN-14li. Assuming the black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> mass indicated by host galaxy scaling relations, these observations imply that the periodicity originates from close to the event horizon and that the black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> is rapidly spinning. Our findings demonstrate that tidal disruption events can generate quasi-periodic oscillations that encode information about the physical properties of their black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s.</p>

Supersonic gas streams enhance the formation of massive black holes in the early universe
<p>The origin of super-massive black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s in the early universe remains poorly understood. Gravitational collapse of a massive primordial gas cloud is a promising initial process, but theoretical studies have difficulty growing the black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> fast enough. We report numerical simulations of early black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> formation starting from realistic cosmological conditions. Supersonic gas motions left over from the Big Bang prevent early gas cloud formation until rapid gas condensation is triggered in a protogalactic halo. A protostar is formed in the dense, turbulent gas cloud, and it grows by sporadic mass accretion until it acquires 34,000 solar masses. The massive star ends its life with a catastrophic collapse to leave a black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>—a promising seed for the formation of a monstrous black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>.</p>

Holographic description of a quantum black hole on a computer
<p>Black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s have been predicted to radiate particles and eventually evaporate, which has led to the information loss paradox and implies that the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics may be violated. Superstring theory, a consistent theory of quantum gravity, provides a possible solution to the paradox if evaporating black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s can actually be described in terms of standard quantum mechanical systems, as conjectured from the theory. Here, we test this conjecture by calculating the mass of a black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> in the corresponding quantum mechanical system numerically. Our results agree well with the prediction from gravity theory, including the leading quantum gravity correction. Our ability to simulate black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s offers the potential to further explore the yet mysterious nature of quantum gravity through well-established quantum mechanics.</p>

A precise measurement of the magnetic field in the corona of the black hole binary V404 Cygni
<p>Observations of binary stars containing an accreting black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> or neutron star often show x-ray emission extending to high energies (>10 kilo­–electron volts), which is ascribed to an accretion disk corona of energetic particles akin to those seen in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solar corona</span></strong>.

Using simultaneous infrared, optical, x-ray, and radio observations of the Galactic black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> system V404 Cygni, showing a rapid synchrotron cooling event in its 2015 outburst, we present a precise 461 ± 12 gauss magnetic field measurement in the corona.

Increase in predator-prey size ratios throughout the Phanerozoic history of marine ecosystems
<p>The escalation hypothesis posits that predation by increasingly powerful and metabolically active carnivores has been a major driver of metazoan evolution. We test a key tenet of this hypothesis by analyzing predatory drill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s in fossil marine shells, which provide a ~500-million-year record of individual predator-prey interactions. We show that drill-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> size is a robust predictor of body size among modern drilling predators and that drill-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> size (and thus inferred predator size and power) rose substantially from the Ordovician to the Quaternary period, whereas the size of drilled prey remained stable. Together, these trends indicate a directional increase in predator-prey size ratios. We hypothesize that increasing predator-prey size ratios reflect increases in prey abundance, prey nutrient content, and predation among predators.</p>

Voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into smooth muscle during contraction promotes endothelium-mediated feedback vasodilation in arterioles
<p>Vascular smooth muscle contraction is suppressed by feedback dilation mediated by the endothelium. In skeletal muscle arterioles, this feedback can be activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals passing from smooth muscle through gap junctions to endothelial cells, which protrude through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s in the internal elastic lamina to make contact with vascular smooth muscle cells. Although hypothetically either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) may provide the intercellular signal, it is generally thought that IP<sub>3</sub> diffusion is responsible. We provide evidence that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCCs) in vascular smooth muscle can pass to the endothelium through positions aligned with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s in the internal elastic lamina in amounts sufficient to activate endothelial cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. In endothelial cells in which IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs) were blocked, VDCC-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were transient and localized to the endothelium that protrudes through the internal elastic lamina to contact vascular smooth muscle cells. In endothelial cells in which IP<sub>3</sub>Rs were not blocked, VDCC-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in endothelial cells were amplified to form propagating waves. These waves activated voltage-insensitive, intermediate-conductance, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (IK<sub>Ca</sub>) channels, thereby providing feedback that effectively suppressed vasoconstriction and enabled cycles of constriction and dilation called vasomotion. Thus, agonists that stimulate vascular smooth muscle depolarization provide Ca<sup>2+</sup> to endothelial cells to activate a feedback circuit that protects tissue blood flow.</p>

Counter-propagating charge transport in the quantum Hall effect regime
<p>The quantum Hall effect, observed in a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field, imposes a 1D-like chiral, downstream, transport of charge carriers along the sample edges. Although this picture remains valid for electrons and Laughlin’s fractional quasiparticles, it no longer holds for quasiparticles in the so-called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>-conjugate states. These states are expected, when disorder and interactions are weak, to harbor upstream charge modes. However, so far, charge currents were observed to flow exclusively downstream in the quantum Hall regime. Studying the canonical spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized <i>v</i> = 2/3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>-like states in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures, we observed a significant upstream charge current at short propagation distances in the spin unpolarized state.</p>

The multiple merger assembly of a hyperluminous obscured quasar at redshift 4.6
<p>Galaxy mergers and gas accretion from the cosmic web drove the growth of galaxies and their central black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s at early epochs. We report spectroscopic imaging of a multiple merger event in the most luminous known galaxy, WISE J224607.56−052634.9 (W2246−0526), a dust-obscured quasar at redshift 4.6, 1.3 billion years after the Big Bang. Far-infrared dust continuum observations show three galaxy companions around W2246−0526 with disturbed morphologies, connected by streams of dust likely produced by the dynamical interaction. The detection of tidal dusty bridges shows that W2246−0526 is accreting its neighbors, suggesting that merger activity may be a dominant mechanism through which the most luminous galaxies simultaneously obscure and feed their central supermassive black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s.</p>

Observation of chiral phonons
<p>Chirality reveals symmetry breaking of the fundamental interaction of elementary particles. In condensed matter, for example, the chirality of electrons governs many unconventional transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect. Here we show that phonons can exhibit intrinsic chirality in monolayer tungsten diselenide. The broken inversion symmetry of the lattice lifts the degeneracy of clockwise and counterclockwise phonon modes at the corners of the Brillouin zone. We identified the phonons by the intervalley transfer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>-phonon interactions during the indirect infrared absorption, and we confirmed their chirality by the infrared circular dichroism arising from pseudoangular momentum conservation.

A generic interface to reduce the efficiency-stability-cost gap of perovskite solar cells
<p>A major bottleneck delaying the further commercialization of thin-film solar cells based on hybrid organohalide lead perovskites is interface loss in state-of-the-art devices. We present a generic interface architecture that combines solution-processed, reliable, and cost-efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>-transporting materials without compromising efficiency, stability, or scalability of perovskite solar cells. Tantalum-doped tungsten oxide (Ta-WO<i><sub>x</sub></i>)/conjugated polymer multilayers offer a surprisingly small interface barrier and form quasi-ohmic contacts universally with various scalable conjugated polymers. In a simple device with regular planar architecture and a self-assembled monolayer, Ta-WO<i><sub>x</sub></i>–doped interface–based perovskite solar cells achieve maximum efficiencies of 21.2% and offer more than 1000 hours of light stability. By eliminating additional ionic dopants, these findings open up the entire class of organics as scalable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>-transporting materials for perovskite solar cells.</p>

Perovskite solar cells with CuSCN hole extraction layers yield stabilized efficiencies greater than 20%
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with efficiencies greater than 20% have been realized only with expensive organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>-transporting materials. We demonstrate PSCs that achieve stabilized efficiencies exceeding 20% with copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> extraction layer. A fast solvent removal method enabled the creation of compact, highly conformal CuSCN layers that facilitate rapid carrier extraction and collection. The PSCs showed high thermal stability under long-term heating, although their operational stability was poor. This instability originated from potential-induced degradation of the CuSCN/Au contact. The addition of a conductive reduced graphene oxide spacer layer between CuSCN and gold allowed PSCs to retain >95% of their initial efficiency after aging at a maximum power point for 1000 hours under full solar intensity at 60°C. Under both continuous full-sun illumination and thermal stress, CuSCN-based devices surpassed the stability of spiro-OMeTAD–based PSCs.</p>

Extremely efficient internal exciton dissociation through edge states in layered 2D perovskites

Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites are solution-processed quantum wells wherein the band gap can be tuned by varying the perovskite-layer thickness, which modulates the effective electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> confinement. We report that, counterintuitive to classical quantum-confined systems where photogenerated electrons and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s are strongly bound by Coulomb interactions or excitons, the photophysics of thin films made of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a thickness exceeding two perovskite-crystal units (>1.3 nanometers) is dominated by lower-energy states associated with the local intrinsic electronic structure of the edges of the perovskite layers. These states provide a direct pathway for dissociating excitons into longer-lived free carriers that substantially improve the performance of optoelectronic devices.</p>

Observation of a nematic quantum Hall liquid on the surface of bismuth

We examined the quantum Hall states that arise in high magnetic fields from anisotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> pockets on the Bi(111) surface. Spectroscopy performed with a scanning tunneling microscope showed that a combination of single-particle effects and many-body Coulomb interactions lift the six-fold Landau level (LL) degeneracy to form three valley-polarized quantum Hall states. We imaged the resulting anisotropic LL wave functions and found that they have a different orientation for each broken-symmetry state. The wave functions correspond to those expected from pairs of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> valleys and provide a direct spatial signature of a nematic electronic phase.</p>

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

Magnetic field–induced pair density wave state in the cuprate vortex halo

Quantum-critical conductivity of the Dirac fluid in graphene

At higher doping, we detected two distinct current-carrying modes with zero and nonzero total momenta, a manifestation of relativistic hydrodynamics.

Spin transport in a Mott insulator of ultracold fermions

In contrast to charge transport, the measurement of spin transport in such materials is highly challenging. We observed spin conduction and diffusion in a system of ultracold fermionic atoms that realizes the half-filled Fermi-Hubbard model. For strong interactions, spin diffusion is driven by super-exchange and doublon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>–assisted tunneling, and strongly violates the quantum limit of charge diffusion. The technique developed in this work can be extended to finite doping, which can shed light on the complex interplay between spin and charge in the Hubbard model.</p>

Methylammonium-free, high-performance, and stable perovskite solar cells on a planar architecture
<p>Currently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high performances greater than 20% contain bromine (Br), causing a suboptimal bandgap, and the thermally unstable methylammonium (MA) molecule. Avoiding Br and especially MA can therefore result in more optimal bandgaps and stable perovskites. We show that inorganic cation tuning, using rubidium and cesium, enables highly crystalline formamidinium-based perovskites without Br or MA. On a conventional, planar device architecture, using polymeric interlayers at the electron- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>-transporting interface, we demonstrate an efficiency of 20.35% (stabilized), one of the highest for MA-free perovskites, with a drastically improved stability reached without the stabilizing influence of mesoporous interlayers. The perovskite is not heated beyond 100°C. Going MA-free is a new direction for perovskites that are inherently stable and compatible with tandems or flexible substrates, which are the main routes commercializing PSCs.</p>

We show that inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of CePd<sub>3</sub> provides a benchmark for ab initio calculations based on dynamical mean field theory. The magnetic response is strongly momentum dependent thanks to the formation of coherent f-electron bands at low temperature, with an amplitude that is strongly enhanced by local particle-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> interactions. The agreement between experiment and theory shows that we have a robust first-principles understanding of the temperature dependence of f-electron coherence.</p>

These excitons obey optical selection rules distinct from those in conventional semiconductors and feature an electron pseudospin winding number of 2.

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators

<p>Ultraluminous x-ray sources (ULXs) in nearby galaxies shine brighter than any x-ray source in our Galaxy. ULXs are usually modeled as stellar-mass black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s (BHs) accreting at very high rates or intermediate-mass BHs. We present observations showing that NGC 5907 ULX is instead an x-ray accreting neutron star (NS) with a spin period evolving from 1.43 seconds in 2003 to 1.13 seconds in 2014. It has an isotropic peak luminosity of [Formula]1000 times the Eddington limit for a NS at 17.1 megaparsec. Standard accretion models fail to explain its luminosity, even assuming beamed emission, but a strong multipolar magnetic field can describe its properties. These findings suggest that other extreme ULXs (x-ray luminosity [Formula] 10<sup>41 </sup>erg second[Formula]) might harbor NSs.</p>

Taking a goal-centred dynamic snapshot as a possibility for local homing in initially naive bumblebees
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Characteristics of initial outbound flights of bumblebees lead to a hypothesis how bumblebees use information gained in the close vicinity of their inconspicuous nest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> to return to their home location.</p>

The metabolic costs of fighting and host exploitation in a seed-drilling parasitic wasp
<p><bold>Editors' Choice:</bold> Fights between parasitoid females require little energy, but drilling through seeds to access hosts is expensive. Females avoid metabolic costs by reusing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s drilled by rivals (superparasitism).</p>

Quantification of the ossification of the lateral cuneiform in the feet of young children with unilateral congenital talipes equinovarus
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>After the initial correction of congenital talipes equinovarus   (CTEV) using the Ponseti method, a subsequent dynamic deformity   is often managed by transfer of the tendon of tibialis anterior   (TATT) to the lateral cuneiform. Many surgeons believe the lateral   cuneiform should be ossified before surgery is undertaken. This   study quantifies the ossification process of the lateral cuneiform   in children with CTEV between one and three years of age. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The length, width and height of the lateral cuneiform were measured   in 43 consecutive patients with unilateral CTEV who had been treated   using the Ponseti method. Measurements were taken by two independent   observers on standardised anteroposterior and lateral radiographs   of both feet taken at one, two and three years of age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All dimensions of the lateral cuneiform on the affected side   increased annually but remained smaller than the corresponding dimensions   of the unaffected foot (p < 0.01). The lateral cuneiform resembled   a 9 mm cube at two years and an 11 mm cube at three years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>At one and two years, the ossification centre of the lateral   cuneiform may not be large enough to accommodate a drill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> for   tendon transfer. However, by three years, it has undergone sufficient   ossification to do so.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1109–14.</p></sec>

The <i>in vivo</i> effect of a porous titanium alloy flange with hydroxyapatite, silver and fibronectin coatings on soft-tissue integration of intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prostheses
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The Intraosseous Transcutaneous Amputation Prosthesis (ITAP)   may improve quality of life for amputees by avoiding soft-tissue   complications associated with socket prostheses and by improving   sensory feedback and function. It relies on the formation of a seal   between the soft tissues and the implant and currently has a flange   with drilled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s to promote dermal attachment. Despite this, infection   remains a significant risk. This study explored alternative strategies   to enhance soft-tissue integration.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The effect of ITAP pins with a fully porous titanium alloy flange   with interconnected pores on soft-tissue integration was investigated.   The flanges were coated with fibronectin-functionalised hydroxyapatite   and silver coatings, which have been shown to have an antibacterial   effect, while also promoting viable fibroblast growth <i>in   vitro. </i>The ITAP pins were implanted along the length of   ovine tibias, and histological assessment was undertaken four weeks   post-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The porous titanium alloy flange reduced epithelial downgrowth   and increased soft-tissue integration compared with the current   drilled flange. The addition of coatings did not enhance these effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results indicate that a fully porous titanium alloy flange   has the potential to increase the soft-tissue seal around ITAP and   reduce susceptibility to infection compared with the current design.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:393–400.</p></sec>

The effect of two different orthoses on pain, hand function, patient satisfaction and preference in patients with thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the Push Ortho Thumb Brace   CMC and a custom-made orthosis in the treatment of patients with   primary osteoarthritis of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb.   Our outcome measures were pain scores, tests of hand function, patient   satisfaction and patient preference.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A multicentre crossover randomised controlled trial was conducted   which included 63 patients (44 women) with primary osteoarthritis   of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb. Of these, 59 patients   with a mean age of 60.1 years (standard deviation 8.2), completed   the study. Patients used both orthoses for two weeks with a two-week washout   period in-between. Pain was measured on a 10-cm visual analogue   scale. Hand function was assessed using the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function   test, Nine Hole Peg Test, key grip, pinch grip and Functional Index   for Hand Osteoarthritis. Patient preference was assessed using the   Dutch version of the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with   Assistive Technology score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both orthoses resulted in a minor reduction in pain scores without   significant difference between the two orthoses. The Push Ortho   Thumb Brace CMC interfered less with key grip (p < 0.001) and   the Nine Hole Peg Test (p < 0.001) than the custom-made orthosis.   The Push Ortho Thumb Brace CMC had a higher patient satisfaction   (p < 0.001) and most patients preferred this orthosis for future   use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When considering an orthosis for osteoarthritis of the carpometacarpal   joint of the thumb, patients may prefer the Push Ortho Thumb Brace   CMC.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:237–44.</p></sec>

A Group D MAPK Protects Plants from Autotoxicity by Suppressing Herbivore-Induced Defense Signaling
<p>The mechanisms by which plants activate and enhance defense responses have been well studied; however, the regulatory mechanisms that allow plants to avoid excessive defense responses are poorly understood. Here, we identified a group D mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>OsMAPK20-5</i>, whose expression was rapidly induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation of gravid female adults of a destructive rice pest, brown planthopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>), but not by BPH nymphs. Expression silencing of <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) after gravid female BPH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation, and thereby increased rice plant resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs. However, when exposed to high densities of gravid BPH females, irMAPK plants wilted earlier than wild-type plants, which could be attributed to the hyperaccumulation of ethylene and NO in irMAPK plants. Interestingly, when released into the field, irMAPK plants displayed broad resistance to BPH and white-backed planthopper (<i>Sogatella furcifera</i>), the two most destructive pests of rice, and produced higher yield. Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of rice plants to planthoppers, it also enables rice plants to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense-response–related autotoxicity.</p>

The Structural Integrity of Lignin Is Crucial for Resistance against <i>Striga hermonthica</i> Parasitism in Rice
<p><i>Striga</i> species are parasitic weeds that seriously constrain the productivity of food staples, including cereals and legumes, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In eastern and central Africa, <i>Striga</i> spp. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong> as much as 40 million hectares of smallholder farmland causing total crop failure during severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation. As the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance are yet to be elucidated, we undertook a comparative metabolome study using the <i>Striga</i>-resistant rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivar ‘Nipponbare’ and the susceptible cultivar ‘Koshihikari’. We found that a number of metabolites accumulated preferentially in the <i>Striga</i>-resistant cultivar upon <i>Striga hermonthica</i> infection. Most apparent was increased deposition of lignin, a phenylpropanoid polymer mainly composed of <i>p</i>-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) aromatic units, around the site of interaction in Nipponbare. The increased deposition of lignin was accompanied by induction of the expression of corresponding enzyme-encoding genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway. In addition, perturbing normal lignin composition by knocking down or overexpressing the genes that regulate lignin composition, i.e. <i>p</i>-COUMARATE 3-HYDROXYLASE or FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE, enhanced susceptibility of Nipponbare to <i>S</i>. <i>hermonthica</i> infection. These results demonstrate that enhanced lignin deposition and maintenance of the structural integrity of lignin polymers deposited at the infection site are crucial for postattachment resistance against <i>S</i>. <i>hermonthica</i>.</p>

Loliolide, a Carotenoid Metabolite, Is a Potential Endogenous Inducer of Herbivore Resistance
<p>Jasmonic acid (JA) plays an important role in the induction of herbivore resistance in many plants. However, JA-independent herbivore resistance has been suggested. An herbivore-resistance-inducing substance was isolated from <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-infected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) leaves in which a hypersensitive response (HR) was induced and identified as loliolide, which has been identified as a β-carotene metabolite. When applied to tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves, loliolide decreased the survival rate of the two-spotted spider mite, <i>Tetranychus urticae</i>, egg deposition by the same pest, and the survival rate of larvae of the common cutworm <i>Spodoptera litura</i> without exhibiting toxicity against these herbivores. Endogenous loliolide levels increased not only with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation by <i>S</i>. <i>litura</i> larvae, but also with the exogenous application of their oral secretions in tomato. A microarray analysis identified cell-wall–associated defense genes as loliolide-responsive tomato genes, and exogenous JA application did not induce the expression of these genes. <i>Suppressor of zeaxanthin</i>-<i>less</i> (<i>szl</i>), an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutant with a point mutation in a key gene of the β-carotene metabolic pathway, exhibited the decreased accumulation of endogenous loliolide and increased susceptibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation by the western flower thrip (<i>Frankliniella occidentalis</i>). A pretreatment with loliolide decreased susceptibility to thrips in the JA-insensitive Arabidopsis mutant <i>coronatine</i>-<i>insensitive1</i>. Exogenous loliolide did not restore reduced electrolyte leakage in <i>szl</i> in response to a HR-inducing bacterial strain. These results suggest that loliolide functions as an endogenous signal that mediates defense responses to herbivores, possibly independently of JA, at least in tomato and Arabidopsis plants.</p>

Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols, and esters, are formed when plant tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct plant defense at wound sites, indirect plant defense via the attraction of herbivore predators, and plant-plant communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for plants to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduction of C6-aldehydes into C6-alcohols is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde reduction remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant plants displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-alcohol production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ed wild-type plants compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> plants, which corresponded with reduced C6-alcohol levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> plants were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered photosystem II activity. Our study shows that reductases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding toxicity from volatile carbonyls and in the attraction of herbivore predators.</p>

Redox Control of Aphid Resistance through Altered Cell Wall Composition and Nutritional Quality
<p>The mechanisms underpinning plant perception of phloem-feeding insects, particularly aphids, remain poorly characterized. Therefore, the role of apoplastic redox state in controlling aphid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation was explored using transgenic tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) plants that have either high (PAO) or low (TAO) ascorbate oxidase (AO) activities relative to the wild type. Only a small number of leaf transcripts and metabolites were changed in response to genotype, and cell wall composition was largely unaffected. Aphid fecundity was decreased significantly in TAO plants compared with other lines. Leaf sugar levels were increased and maximum extractable AO activities were decreased in response to aphids in all genotypes. Transcripts encoding the Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog F, signaling components involved in ethylene and other hormone-mediated pathways, photosynthetic electron transport components, sugar, amino acid, and cell wall metabolism, were increased significantly in the TAO plants in response to aphid perception relative to other lines. The levels of galactosylated xyloglucan were decreased significantly in response to aphid feeding in all the lines, the effect being the least in the TAO plants. Similarly, all lines exhibited increases in tightly bound (1→4)-β-galactan. Taken together, these findings identify AO-dependent mechanisms that limit aphid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation.</p>

An Aphid Effector Targets Trafficking Protein VPS52 in a Host-Specific Manner to Promote Virulence
<p>Plant- and animal-feeding insects secrete saliva inside their hosts, containing effectors, which may promote nutrient release and suppress immunity. Although for plant pathogenic microbes it is well established that effectors target host proteins to modulate host cell processes and promote disease, the host cell targets of herbivorous insects remain elusive. Here, we show that the existing plant pathogenic microbe effector paradigm can be extended to herbivorous insects in that effector-target interactions inside host cells modify critical host processes to promote plant susceptibility. We showed that the effector Mp1 from <i>Myzus persicae</i> associates with the host Vacuolar Protein Sorting Associated Protein52 (VPS52). Using natural variants, we provide a strong link between effector virulence activity and association with VPS52, and show that the association is highly specific to <i>M</i>. <i>persicae</i>-host interactions. Also, coexpression of Mp1, but not Mp1-like variants, specifically with host VPS52s resulted in effector relocalization to vesicle-like structures that associate with prevacuolar compartments. We show that high VPS52 levels negatively impact virulence, and that aphids are able to reduce VPS52 levels during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation, indicating that VPS52 is an important virulence target. Our work is an important step forward in understanding, at the molecular level, how a major agricultural pest promotes susceptibility during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation of crop plants. We give evidence that an herbivorous insect employs effectors that interact with host proteins as part of an effective virulence strategy, and that these effectors likely function in a species-specific manner.</p>

Hybridization may give some parasites a leg up
<p>Infecting an estimated 230 million people, schistosomiasis is the world's most widespread parasitic disease after malaria. But temperate latitudes were thought to be spared, until researchers documented an outbreak on the French island of Corsica in 2014. Scientists found that a local freshwater snail was serving as the intermediate host that's essential to the flatworms' complicated life cycle. The river is still <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ed: At least 120 people have become infected. And the disease is turning up elsewhere on Corsica. The culprit is no ordinary schistosome parasite, but a hybrid of two separate species that appears to be better than both parent species at infecting both the snails and its unfortunate mammalian hosts. Such hybrids, discovered in other parasitic species as well, could widen a parasite's range of host mammals, complicating efforts to control it.</p>

A selective insecticidal protein from <i>Pseudomonas</i> for controlling corn rootworms
<p>The coleopteran insect western corn rootworm (WCR) (<i>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</i> LeConte) is a devastating crop pest in North America and Europe. Although crop plants that produce <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (<i>Bt</i>) proteins can limit insect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation, some insect populations have evolved resistance to <i>Bt</i> proteins. Here we describe an insecticidal protein, designated IPD072Aa, that is isolated from <i>Pseudomonas chlororaphis.</i> Transgenic corn plants expressing IPD072Aa show protection from WCR insect injury under field conditions. IPD072Aa leaves several lepidopteran and hemipteran insect species unaffected but is effective in killing WCR larvae that are resistant to <i>Bt</i> proteins produced by currently available transgenic corn. IPD072Aa can be used to protect corn crops against WCRs.</p>

12-Oxo-Phytodienoic Acid Acts as a Regulator of Maize Defense against Corn Leaf Aphid
<p>The corn leaf aphid (CLA; <i>Rhopalosiphum maidis</i>) is a phloem sap-sucking insect that attacks many cereal crops, including maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We previously showed that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical plant breeding, provides enhanced resistance to CLA. Here, using electrophysiological monitoring of aphid feeding behavior, we demonstrate that Mp708 provides phloem-mediated resistance to CLA. Furthermore, feeding by CLA on Mp708 plants enhanced callose deposition, a potential defense mechanism utilized by plants to limit aphid feeding and subsequent colonization. In maize, benzoxazinoids (BX) or BX-derived metabolites contribute to enhanced callose deposition by providing heightened resistance to CLA. However, BX and BX-derived metabolites were not significantly altered in CLA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ed Mp708 plants, indicating BX-independent defense against CLA. Evidence presented here suggests that the constitutively higher levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) in Mp708 plants contributed to enhanced callose accumulation and heightened CLA resistance. OPDA enhanced the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and receptor genes, and the synergistic interactions of OPDA and CLA feeding significantly induced the expression of the transcripts encoding Maize insect resistance1-Cysteine Protease, a key defensive protein against insect pests, in Mp708 plants. Furthermore, exogenous application of OPDA on maize jasmonic acid-deficient plants caused enhanced callose accumulation and heightened resistance to CLA, suggesting that the OPDA-mediated resistance to CLA is independent of the jasmonic acid pathway. We further demonstrate that the signaling function of OPDA, rather than a direct toxic effect, contributes to enhanced CLA resistance in Mp708.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>ACTIN-DEPOLYMERIZING FACTOR3</i> Is Required for Controlling Aphid Feeding from the Phloem
<p>The actin cytoskeleton network has an important role in plant cell growth, division, and stress response. Actin-depolymerizing factors (ADFs) are a group of actin-binding proteins that contribute to reorganization of the actin network. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>ADF3</i> is required in the phloem for controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation by <i>Myzus persicae</i> Sulzer, commonly known as the green peach aphid (GPA), which is an important phloem sap-consuming pest of more than fifty plant families. In agreement with a role for the actin-depolymerizing function of ADF3 in defense against the GPA, we show that resistance in <i>adf3</i> was restored by overexpression of the related ADF4 and the actin cytoskeleton destabilizers, cytochalasin D and latrunculin B. Electrical monitoring of the GPA feeding behavior indicates that the GPA stylets found sieve elements faster when feeding on the <i>adf3</i> mutant compared to the wild-type plant. In addition, once they found the sieve elements, the GPA fed for a more prolonged period from sieve elements of <i>adf3</i> compared to the wild-type plant. The longer feeding period correlated with an increase in fecundity and population size of the GPA and a parallel reduction in callose deposition in the <i>adf3</i> mutant. The <i>adf3</i>-conferred susceptibility to GPA was overcome by expression of the <i>ADF3</i> coding sequence from the phloem-specific <i>SUC2</i> promoter, thus confirming the importance of <i>ADF3</i> function in the phloem. We further demonstrate that the <i>ADF3</i>-dependent defense mechanism is linked to the transcriptional up-regulation of <i>PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT4</i>, which is an important regulator of defenses against the GPA.</p>

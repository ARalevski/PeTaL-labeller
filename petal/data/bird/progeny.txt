Echocardiographic Screening for Rheumatic Heart Disease in High and Low Risk Australian Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Echocardiographic screening for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is becoming more widespread, but screening studies to date have used different echocardiographic definitions. The World Heart Federation has recently published new criteria for the echocardiographic diagnosis of RHD. We aimed to establish the prevalence of RHD in high-risk Indigenous Australian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> using these criteria and to compare the findings with a group of Australian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> at low risk for RHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Portable echocardiography was performed on high-risk Indigenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> aged 5 to15 years living in remote communities of northern Australia. A comparison group of low-risk, non-Indigenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> living in urban centers was also screened. Echocardiograms were reported in a standardized, blinded fashion. Of 3946 high-risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>, 34 met World Heart Federation criteria for definite RHD (prevalence, 8.6 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 6.0–12.0]) and 66 for borderline RHD (prevalence, 16.7 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 13.0–21.2]). Of 1053 low-risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>, none met the criteria for definite RHD, and 5 met the criteria for borderline RHD. High-risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> were more likely to have definite or borderline RHD than low-risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> (adjusted odds ratio, 5.7 [95% confidence interval, 2.3–14.1]; <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The prevalence of definite RHD in high-risk Indigenous Australian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> approximates what we expected in our population, and no definite RHD was identified in the low-risk group. This study suggests that definite RHD, as defined by the World Heart Federation criteria, is likely to represent true disease. Borderline RHD was identified in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> at both low and high risk, highlighting the need for longitudinal studies to evaluate the clinical significance of this finding.</p></sec>

Effect of Rosuvastatin on Carotid Intima-Media Thickness in Children With Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is an autosomal dominant disorder leading to premature atherosclerosis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH exhibit early signs of atherosclerosis manifested by increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). In this study, we assessed the effect of 2-year treatment with rosuvastatin on carotid IMT in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH (age, 6–<18 years) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >4.9 mmol/L or >4.1 mmol/L in combination with other risk factors received rosuvastatin for 2 years, starting at 5 mg once daily, with uptitration to 10 mg (age, 6–<10 years) or 20 mg (age, 10–<18 years). Carotid IMT was assessed by ultrasonography at baseline and 12 and 24 months in all patients and in age-matched unaffected siblings. Carotid IMT was measured at 3 locations (common carotid artery, carotid bulb, internal carotid artery) in both the left and right carotid arteries. A linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate differences in carotid IMT between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH and the unaffected siblings. <i>P</i> values were adjusted for age, sex, carotid artery site, and family relations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At baseline, mean±SD carotid IMT was significantly greater for the 197 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH compared with the 65 unaffected siblings (0.397±0.049 and 0.377±0.045 mm, respectively; <i>P</i>=0.001). During 2 years of follow-up, the change in carotid IMT was 0.0054 mm/y (95% confidence interval, 0.0030–0.0082) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH and 0.0143 mm/y (95% confidence interval, 0.0095–0.0192) in unaffected siblings (<i>P</i>=0.002). The end-of-study difference in mean carotid IMT between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH and unaffected siblings after 2 years was no longer significant (0.408±0.043 and 0.402±0.042 mm, respectively; <i>P</i>=0.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH who were ≥6 years of age, carotid IMT was significantly greater at baseline compared with unaffected siblings. Rosuvastatin treatment for 2 years resulted in significantly less progression of increased carotid IMT in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH than untreated unaffected siblings. As a result, no difference in carotid IMT could be detected between the 2 groups after 2 years of rosuvastatin. These findings support the value of early initiation of statin treatment for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Latent Rheumatic Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Screening echocardiography has emerged as a potentially powerful tool for early diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The utility of screening echocardiography hinges on the rate of RHD progression and the ability of penicillin prophylaxis to improve outcome. We report the longitudinal outcomes of a cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with latent RHD and identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective natural history study conducted under the Ugandan RHD registry. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with latent RHD and ≥1 year of follow-up were included. All echocardiograms were re-reviewed by experts (2012 World Heart Federation criteria) for inclusion and evidence of change. Bi- and multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models, as well, were developed to search for risk factors for unfavorable outcome and compare progression-free survival between those treated and not treated with penicillin. Propensity and other matching methods with sensitivity analysis were implemented for the evaluation of the penicillin effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded review confirmed 227 cases of latent RHD: 164 borderline and 63 definite (42 mild, 21 moderate/severe). Median age at diagnosis was 12 years and median follow-up was 2.3 years (interquartile range, 2.0–2.9). Penicillin prophylaxis was prescribed in 49.3% with overall adherence of 84.7%. Of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with moderate-to-severe definite RHD, 47.6% had echocardiographic progression (including 2 deaths), and 9.5% had echocardiographic regression. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with mild definite and borderline RHD showed 26% and 9.8% echocardiographic progression and 45.2% and 46.3% echocardiographic improvement, respectively. Of those with mild definite RHD or borderline RHD, more advanced disease category, younger age, and morphological mitral valve features were risk factors for an unfavorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Latent RHD is a heterogeneous diagnosis with variable disease outcomes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with moderate to severe latent RHD have poor outcomes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with both borderline and mild definite RHD are at substantial risk of progression. Although long-term outcome remains unclear, the initial change in latent RHD may be evident during the first 1 to 2 years following diagnosis. Natural history data are inherently limited, and a randomized clinical trial is needed to definitively determine the impact of penicillin prophylaxis on the trajectory of latent RHD.</p></sec>

Impact of Heart Transplantation on the Functional Status of US Children With End-Stage Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>There are limited data describing the functional status (FS) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> after heart transplant (HT). We sought to describe the FS of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> surviving at least 1 year after HT, to evaluate the impact of HT on FS, and to identify factors associated with abnormal FS post-HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data were used to identify all US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> <21 years of age surviving ≥1 year post-HT from 2005 to 2014 with a functional status score (FSS) available at 3 time points (listing, transplant, ≥1 year post-HT). Logistic regression and generalized estimating equations were used to identify factors associated with abnormal FS (FSS≤8) post-HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1633 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> met study criteria. At the 1-year assessment, 64% were “fully active/no limitations” (FSS=10), 21% had “minor limitations with strenuous activity” (FSS=9); and 15% scored ≤8. In comparison with listing FS, FS at 1 year post-HT increased in 91% and declined/remained unchanged in 9%. A stepwise regression procedure selected the following variables for association with abnormal FS at 1 year post-HT: ≥18 years of age (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2–2.7), black race (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.0), support with ≥inotropes at HT (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2–2.5), hospitalization status at HT (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0–2.19), chronic steroid use at HT (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0–2.2), and treatment for early rejection (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5–2.7).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Among US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> who survive at least 1 year after HT, FS is excellent for the majority of patients. HT is associated with substantial improvement in FS for most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. Early rejection, older age, black race, chronic steroid use, hemodynamic support at HT, and being hospitalized at HT are associated with abnormal FS post-HT.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Health Promotion in Children: Challenges and Opportunities for 2020 and Beyond: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>This document provides a pediatric-focused companion to “Defining and Setting National Goals for Cardiovascular Health Promotion and Disease Reduction: The American Heart Association’s Strategic Impact Goal Through 2020 and Beyond,” focused on cardiovascular health promotion and disease reduction in adults and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. The principles detailed in the document reflect the American Heart Association’s new dynamic and proactive goal to promote cardiovascular health throughout the life course. The primary focus is on adult cardiovascular health and disease prevention, but critical to achievement of this goal is maintenance of ideal cardiovascular health from birth through childhood to young adulthood and beyond. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles and metrics that define cardiovascular health in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> for the clinical or research setting, and a balanced and critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the cardiovascular health construct in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and adolescents is provided. Specifically, this document discusses 2 important factors: the promotion of ideal cardiovascular health in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and the improvement of cardiovascular health metric scores in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> currently classified as having poor or intermediate cardiovascular health. Other topics include the current status of cardiovascular health in US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>, opportunities for the refinement of health metrics, improvement of health metric scores, and possibilities for promoting ideal cardiovascular health. Importantly, concerns about the suitability of using single thresholds to identify elevated cardiovascular risk throughout the childhood years and the limits of our current knowledge are noted, and suggestions for future directions and research are provided.</p>

Using nature to understand nurture
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> resemble their parents in health, wealth, and well-being. Is parent-child similarity in traits and behaviors due to nature (the genes that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> inherit from their parents) or nurture (the environment that parents provide for their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>)? Answering this enduring question can directly inform our efforts to reduce social inequality and disease burden. On page 424 of this issue, Kong <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) use genetic data from trios of parents and offspring to address this question in an intriguing way. By measuring parents' and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>'s genes, they provide evidence that inherited family environments influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>'s educational success, a phenomenon termed genetic nurture.</p>

Cognitive science in the field: A preschool intervention durably enhances intuitive but not formal mathematics
<p>Many poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> are underprepared for demanding primary school curricula. Research in cognitive science suggests that school achievement could be improved by preschool pedagogy in which numerate adults engage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>’s spontaneous, nonsymbolic mathematical concepts. To test this suggestion, we designed and evaluated a game-based preschool curriculum intended to exercise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>’s emerging skills in number and geometry. In a randomized field experiment with 1540 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> (average age 4.9 years) in 214 Indian preschools, 4 months of math game play yielded marked and enduring improvement on the exercised intuitive abilities, relative to no-treatment and active control conditions. Math-trained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> also showed immediate gains on symbolic mathematical skills but displayed no advantage in subsequent learning of the language and concepts of school mathematics.</p>

Cardiovascular Consequences of Childhood Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure: Prevailing Evidence, Burden, and Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although public health programs have led to a substantial decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoke exposure are by no means a thing of the past. In the United States, 4 of 10 school-aged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and 1 of 3 adolescents are involuntarily exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS), with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> of minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in low-socioeconomic-status households being disproportionately affected (68% and 43%, respectively). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> are particularly vulnerable, with little control over home and social environment, and lack the understanding, agency, and ability to avoid SHS exposure on their own volition; they also have physiological or behavioral characteristics that render them especially susceptible to effects of SHS. Side-stream smoke (the smoke emanating from the burning end of the cigarette), a major component of SHS, contains a higher concentration of some toxins than mainstream smoke (inhaled by the smoker directly), making SHS potentially as dangerous as or even more dangerous than direct smoking. Compelling animal and human evidence shows that SHS exposure during childhood is detrimental to arterial function and structure, resulting in premature atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular consequences. Childhood SHS exposure is also related to impaired cardiac autonomic function and changes in heart rate variability. In addition, childhood SHS exposure is associated with clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Individualized interventions to reduce childhood exposure to SHS are shown to be at least modestly effective, as are broader-based policy initiatives such as community smoking bans and increased taxation.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>The purpose of this statement is to summarize the available evidence on the cardiovascular health consequences of childhood SHS exposure; this will support ongoing efforts to further reduce and eliminate SHS exposure in this vulnerable population. This statement reviews relevant data from epidemiological studies, laboratory-based experiments, and controlled behavioral trials concerning SHS and cardiovascular disease risk in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. Information on the effects of SHS exposure on the cardiovascular system in animal and pediatric studies, including vascular disruption and platelet activation, oxidation and inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular stiffness, changes in vascular structure, and autonomic dysfunction, is examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The epidemiological, observational, and experimental evidence accumulated to date demonstrates the detrimental cardiovascular consequences of SHS exposure in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications:</title><p>Increased awareness of the adverse, lifetime cardiovascular consequences of childhood SHS may facilitate the development of innovative individual, family-centered, and community health interventions to reduce and ideally eliminate SHS exposure in the vulnerable pediatric population. This evidence calls for a robust public health policy that embraces zero tolerance of childhood SHS exposure.</p></sec>

The fading American dream: Trends in absolute income mobility since 1940
<p>We estimated rates of “absolute income mobility”—the fraction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> who earn more than their parents—by combining data from U.S. Census and Current Population Survey cross sections with panel data from de-identified tax records. We found that rates of absolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> born in 1940 to 50% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates experienced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that reviving the “American dream” of high rates of absolute mobility would require economic growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribution.</p>

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of open tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial fractures in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric Ventricular Assist Device for Bridge to Heart Transplantation in US Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Recent data suggest that the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device is superior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for bridge to heart transplantation. Published data are limited to 1 in 4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> who received the device as part of the US clinical trial. We analyzed outcomes for all US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> who received the EXCOR to characterize device outcomes in an unselected cohort and to identify risk factors for mortality to facilitate patient selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>This multicenter, prospective cohort study involved all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> implanted with the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device at 47 centers from May 2007 through December 2010. Multiphase nonproportional hazards modeling was used to identify risk factors for early (<2 months) and late mortality. Of 204 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> supported with the EXCOR, the median duration of support was 40 days (range, 1–435 days). Survival at 12 months was 75%, including 64% who reached transplantation, 6% who recovered, and 5% who were alive on the device. Multivariable analysis identified lower weight, biventricular assist device support, and elevated bilirubin as risk factors for early mortality and bilirubin extremes and renal dysfunction as risk factors for late mortality. Neurological dysfunction occurred in 29% and was the leading cause of death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Use of the Berlin Heart EXCOR has risen dramatically over the past decade. The EXCOR has emerged as a new treatment standard in the United States for pediatric bridge to transplantation. Three-quarters of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> survived to transplantation or recovery; an important fraction experienced neurological dysfunction. Smaller patient size, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, and biventricular assist device use were associated with mortality, whereas extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before implantation and congenital heart disease were not.</p></sec>

Protecting unauthorized immigrant mothers improves their children’s mental health
<p>The United States is embroiled in a debate about whether to protect or deport its estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants, but the fact that these immigrants are also parents to more than 4 million U.S.-born <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> is often overlooked. We provide causal evidence of the impact of parents’ unauthorized immigration status on the health of their U.S. citizen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program granted temporary protection from deportation to more than 780,000 unauthorized immigrants. We used Medicaid claims data from Oregon and exploited the quasi-random assignment of DACA eligibility among mothers with birthdates close to the DACA age qualification cutoff. Mothers’ DACA eligibility significantly decreased adjustment and anxiety disorder diagnoses among their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. Parents’ unauthorized status is thus a substantial barrier to normal child development and perpetuates health inequalities through the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage.</p>

Gender stereotypes about intellectual ability emerge early and influence children’s interests
<p>Common stereotypes associate high-level intellectual ability (brilliance, genius, etc.) with men more than women. These stereotypes discourage women’s pursuit of many prestigious careers; that is, women are underrepresented in fields whose members cherish brilliance (such as physics and philosophy). Here we show that these stereotypes are endorsed by, and influence the interests of, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> as young as 6. Specifically, 6-year-old girls are less likely than boys to believe that members of their gender are “really, really smart.” Also at age 6, girls begin to avoid activities said to be for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> who are “really, really smart.” These findings suggest that gendered notions of brilliance are acquired early and have an immediate effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>’s interests.</p>

The primary study end point was time to death or cardiac transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 80 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a median age at diagnosis of 0.48 (interquartile range, 0.1, 2.5) years. Freedom from death/transplantation was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.0–92.0) 1 year after presentation, 80% (95% CI, 69.0–87.0) at 10 years, and 78% (95% CI, 67.0–86.0) at 20 years. From multivariable analyses, risk factors for death/transplantation included symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of diagnosis (hazard ratio, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.60–11.05; <i>P</i>=0.004), Noonan syndrome (hazard ratio, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.02–8.08; <i>P</i>=0.045), higher posterior wall thickness <i>z</i> score (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.22–1.73; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower fractional shortening <i>z</i> score (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74–0.95; <i>P</i>=0.005) during follow-up.

Association Between Diastolic Blood Pressure During Pediatric In-Hospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Survival
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>On the basis of laboratory cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) investigations and limited adult data demonstrating that survival depends on attaining adequate arterial diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during CPR, the American Heart Association recommends using blood pressure to guide pediatric CPR. However, evidence-based blood pressure targets during pediatric CPR remain an important knowledge gap for CPR guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> ≥37 weeks’ gestation and <19 years old in Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network intensive care units with chest compressions for ≥1 minute and invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring before and during CPR between July 1, 2013, and June 31, 2016, were included. Mean DBP during CPR and Utstein-style standardized cardiac arrest data were collected. The hypothesis was that DBP ≥25 mm Hg during CPR in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> ≥1 year old would be associated with survival. Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurological outcome, defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Categories 1 to 3 or no worse than prearrest baseline. Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error estimates were used to estimate the relative risk of outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded investigators analyzed blood pressure waveforms during CPR from 164 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>, including 60% <1 year old, 60% with congenital heart disease, and 54% after cardiac surgery. The immediate cause of arrest was hypotension in 67%, respiratory decompensation in 44%, and arrhythmia in 19%. Median duration of CPR was 8 minutes (quartiles, 3 and 27 minutes). Ninety percent survived the event, 68% with return of spontaneous circulation and 22% by extracorporeal life support. Forty-seven percent survived to hospital discharge, and 43% survived to discharge with favorable neurological outcome. Maintaining mean DBP ≥25 mm Hg in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> ≥1 year old occurred in 101 of 164 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> (62%) and was associated with survival (adjusted relative risk, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–2.6; <i>P</i>=0.007) and survival with favorable neurological outcome (adjusted relative risk, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–2.5; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data demonstrate that mean DBP ≥25 mm Hg during CPR in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> ≥1 year old was associated with greater likelihood of survival to hospital discharge and survival with favorable neurological outcome.</p></sec>

A pediatric CMR imager reported the CMR images, masked to autopsy information. The pathologists were masked to the information from CMR images. The institutional research ethics committee approved the study, and parental consent was obtained. Assuming a diagnostic accuracy of 50%, 400 cases were required for a 5% precision of estimate. Three cases were excluded from analysis, 2 with no conventional autopsy performed and 1 with insufficient CMR sequences performed. Thirty-eight CMR data sets were nondiagnostic (37 in fetuses ≤24 weeks; 1 in a fetus >24 weeks). In the remaining 359 cases, 44 cardiac abnormalities were noted at autopsy.

Link to Alzheimer's seen in nodding syndrome
<p>A disease mystery with no shortage of leads now has an intriguing new one. Since the 1960s, thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> in poor, war-torn regions of East Africa have developed epilepsy-like seizures in which their heads bob to their chest; over time, the seizures worsen, cognitive problems develop, and the victims ultimately die. Researchers have proposed causes for nodding syndrome that include malnutrition, parasites, and viruses, but have not proved a clear link to any of them. Now, the first published examination of the brains of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> who died after developing the condition suggests it has a key similarity to certain brain diseases of old age, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's: It leaves victims' brains riddled with fibrous tangles containing a protein called tau.</p>

Outbreaks of poliolike disease pose a puzzle
<p>Does a virus that usually causes mild cold symptoms sometimes paralyze <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>? That's the question facing scientists again this fall, after dozens of previously healthy kids across the United States suddenly lost muscle control in their arms or legs, a condition called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) that eerily resembles polio. Sixty-two AFM cases in 22 states have been confirmed in recent weeks, scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said at a news conference on 16 October; 65 more are under investigation. Similar waves occurred in 2014 and 2016, and scientists have fingered a relative of the poliovirus, called enterovirus D68, as a possible culprit. But the evidence isn't conclusive yet, and it's unclear why the virus would only paralyze a small minority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> it infects. Solving these mysteries is urgent because the paralysis can be severe and irreversible.</p>

Watching the teen brain grow
<p>Adolescence is a time of extraordinarily important brain changes. And thanks to an unprecedented study now being launched, scientists will be able to examine those changes in depth, using MRI to define what normal growth looks like—and helping clarify what can go awry in teenage brains. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study—or ABCD Study—is a $300 million effort funded by the National Institutes of Health that will scan the brains of some 10,000 U.S. youths, beginning when they are 9 and 10 years old and imaging them every 2 years for 10 years. In addition to collecting scans of brain structure and function, the research teams at 21 study sites around the country will regularly gather a trove of other information from each youngster, from psychological, cognitive, and environmental data to biological specimens such as DNA. The hope is that by enrolling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> young, before influences like substance use and sports injuries kick in, scientists will be able to untangle chicken-and-egg questions that correlational studies can't—questions about everything from mental illness to the impact of marijuana on the developing brain. The response so far has been encouraging: Two-thirds of the way through a 2-year enrollment period that ends in September, the researchers have signed up more than 6800 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. And anonymized data from the first 4500 of them are due to be deposited in a publicly accessible database later this month.</p>

Firearms and accidental deaths: Evidence from the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting
<p>Exposure to firearms increased substantially after the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and 6 adults were killed. Gun sales spiked by 3 million, on the basis of the increase in the number of background checks for firearm purchases. Google searches for buying and cleaning guns increased. We used Vital Statistics mortality data to examine whether a spike in accidental firearm deaths occurred at the same time as the greater exposure to firearms. We also assessed whether the increase in these deaths was larger in those states where the spike in gun sales per capita was larger. We find that an additional 60 deaths overall, including 20 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>, resulted from unintentional shootings in the immediate aftermath of Sandy Hook.</p>

Clicky hip alone is not a true risk factor for developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A clicky hip is a common referral for clinical and sonographic   screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). There is   controversy regarding whether it represents a true risk factor for   pathological DDH. Therefore a 20-year prospective, longitudinal,   observational study was undertaken to assess the relationship between   the presence of a neonatal clicky hip and pathological DDH.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 362 infants from 1997 to 2016 were referred with clicky   hips to our ‘one-stop’ paediatric hip screening clinic. Hips were   assessed clinically for instability and by ultrasound imaging using   a simplified Graf/Harcke classification. Dislocated or dislocatable   hips were classified as Graf Type IV hips.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at presentation was 13.8 weeks (12.8 to 14.7). In   all 351 out of 362 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> (97.0%) had Graf Type I hips (normal)   that required no treatment. Nine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> (2.5%) had Graf Type II   hips but all resolved to Graf Type I hips on follow-up scans. One   child (0.3%) had Graf Type III hip dysplasia and one child (0.3%)   had an irreducible hip dislocation. The two pathological hips were   associated with unilateral limited hip abduction. Mean referrals increased   from 12.9 to 23.3 each year (p = 0.002) from the first decade of   the study to the second, driven by increasing primary care referrals   (5.5 <i>versus</i> 16.7 per year, p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Most clicky hips required no treatment other than reassurance   to parents. Clicky hips with a normal hip examination should be   considered a variant of normal childhood and not a risk factor for   DDH.

Proximal femoral resection without post-operative traction for the painful dislocated hip in young patients with cerebral palsy
<p>Proximal femoral resection (PFR) is a proven   pain-relieving procedure for the management of patients with severe cerebral   palsy and a painful displaced hip. Previous authors have recommended   post-operative traction or immobilisation to prevent a recurrence   of pain due to proximal migration of the femoral stump. We present   a series of 79 PFRs in 63 patients, age 14.7 years (10 to 26; 35   male, 28 female), none of whom had post-operative traction or immobilisation.</p><p>A total of 71 hips (89.6%) were reported to be pain free or to   have mild pain following surgery. Four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> underwent further   resection for persistent pain; of these, three had successful resolution   of pain and one had no benefit. A total of 16 hips (20.2%) showed   radiographic evidence of heterotopic ossification, all of which   had formed within one year of surgery. Four patients had a wound   infection, one of which needed debridement; all recovered fully.   A total of 59 patients (94%) reported improvements in seating and   hygiene.</p><p>The results are as good as or better than the historical results   of using traction or immobilisation. We recommend that following   PFR, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> can be managed without traction or immobilisation,   and can be discharged earlier and with fewer complications. However,   care should be taken with severely dystonic patients, in whom more   extensive femoral resection should be considered in combination   with management of the increased tone.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:701–6.</p>

Supracondylar osteotomy for the treatment of cubitus varus in children
<p>Cubitus varus is the most frequent complication   following the treatment of supracondylar humeral fractures in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>.   We investigated data from publications reporting on the surgical   management of cubitus varus found in electronic searches of Ovid/MEDLINE   and Cochrane Library databases. In 894 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> from 40 included   studies, the mean age at initial injury was 5.7 years (3 to 8.6)   and 9.8 years (4 to 15.7) at the time of secondary correction. The four   osteotomy techniques were classified as lateral closing wedge, dome,   complex (multiplanar) and distraction osteogenesis. A mean angular   correction of 27.6º (18.5° to 37.0°) was achieved across all classes   of osteotomy. The meta-analytical summary estimate for overall rate   of good to excellent results was 87.8% (95% CI 84.4 to 91.2). No technique   was shown to significantly affect the surgical outcome, and the   risk of complications across all osteotomy classes was 14.5% (95%   CI 10.6 to 18.5). Nerve palsies occurred in 2.53% of cases (95%   CI 1.4 to 3.6), although 78.4% were transient. No one technique   was found to be statistically safer or more effective than any other.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:691–700.</p>

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based risk factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates adult lipid measures. We assessed and compared the utility of a risk model based solely on nonlaboratory risk factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory risk factors plus lipids for predicting high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study) and followed into adulthood when cIMT was measured (mean follow-up, 23.4 years). Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-risk plasma lipid levels were defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Cholesterol Levels in Children. High cIMT was defined as a study-specific value ≥90th percentile. Age and sex were included in each model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In univariate models, all risk factors except for borderline high and high triglycerides in adolescence were associated with high cIMT in adulthood. In multivariable models (relative risk [95% confidence interval]), male sex (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) remained significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05). The addition of lipids into the nonlaboratory risk model slightly but significantly improved discrimination in predicting high cIMT compared with nonlaboratory-based risk factors only (C statistics for laboratory-based model 0.717 [95% confidence interval, 0.685–0.748] and for nonlaboratory 0.698 [95% confidence interval, 0.667–0.731]; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Nonlaboratory-based risk factors and lipids measured in adolescence independently predicted preclinical atherosclerosis in young adulthood. The addition of lipid measurements to traditional clinic-based risk factor assessment provided a statistically significant but clinically modest improvement on adolescent prediction of high cIMT in adulthood.</p></sec>

Conventional Versus Compression-Only Versus No-Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (chest compression and rescue breathing) has been recommended for pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) because of the asphyxial nature of the majority of pediatric cardiac arrest events. However, the clinical effectiveness of additional rescue breathing (conventional CPR) compared with compression-only CPR in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This nationwide population-based study of pediatric OHCA patients was based on data from the All-Japan Utstein Registry. We included all pediatric patients who experienced OHCA in Japan from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012. The primary outcome was a favorable neurological state 1 month after OHCA defined as a Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 to 2 (corresponding to a Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score of 1–3). Outcomes were compared with logistic regression with uni- and multivariable modeling in the overall cohort and for a propensity-matched subset of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 2157 patients were included; 417 received conventional CPR, 733 received compression-only CPR, and 1007 did not receive any bystander CPR. Among these patients, 213 (9.9%) survived with a favorable neurological status 1 month after OHCA, including 108/417 (25.9%) for conventional, 68/733 (9.3%) for compression-only, and 37/1007 (3.7%) for no-bystander CPR. In unadjusted analyses, conventional CPR was superior to compression-only CPR in neurologically favorable survival (odds ratio [OR] 3.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.45–4.76; <i>P</i><0.0001), with a trend favoring conventional CPR that was no longer statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 1.52, 95% CI 0.93–2.49), and with further attenuation of the difference in a propensity-matched subset (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.81–1.77). Both conventional and compression-only CPR were associated with higher odds for neurologically favorable survival compared with no-bystander CPR (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 5.01, 95% CI 2.98–8.57, and OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 3.29, 95% CI 1.93–5.71), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this population-based study of pediatric OHCA in Japan, both conventional and compression-only CPR were associated with superior outcomes compared with no-bystander CPR. Unadjusted outcomes with conventional CPR were superior to compression-only CPR, with the magnitude of difference attenuated and no longer statistically significant after statistical adjustments. These findings support randomized clinical trials comparing conventional versus compression-only CPR in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>, with conventional CPR preferred until such controlled comparative data are available, and either method preferred over no-bystander CPR.</p></sec>

NIH quietly shelves gun research program
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) wasn't coy when it responded to a call from then-President Barack Obama for government agencies to do firearm research. The president's plea came on the heels of a gunman's murder of 20 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December, 2012. Nine months later, the huge biomedical research agency issued three notices encouraging scientists to apply to do research on violence and its prevention, particularly firearm research. NIH has since spent $18 million funding 22 projects. But the agency has now let the gun research program lapse, <i>Science</i> has learned. It stopped taking applications in January, despite a written plea from a score of scientists, and the last new awards are now being launched. Last week, an agency spokesperson said that renewal of the program "is still under consideration," but gave no timeline for when the agency would reach a decision.</p>

Disease sleuths unmask deadly encephalitis culprit
<p>Soon after the monsoon rains arrive in June, the northern city of Gorakhpur transforms into the "encephalitis capital of India." Hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> from across the surrounding Uttar Pradesh state arrive at Baba Raghav Das Medical College with the brain inflammation that causes delirium, seizures, and—in about 20% of those patients—death. For decades, the recurring spates of cases and high mortality rate stumped experts. Now, medical detectives think they have solved the mystery: A major cause of the seasonal encephalitis outbreaks is scrub typhus, a bacterial malady transmitted by a microscopic mite. The culprit was first unmasked 3 years ago—but most researchers didn't believe it then. The new evidence, described this month in <i>Emerging Infectious Diseases</i>, indicates the responsible bacterium is far more dangerous than realized.</p>

Life-saving diphtheria drug is running out
<p>Two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> have died in Europe in the past 2 years because they suffered from diphtheria and did not get an antiserum that neutralizes the deadly toxin produced by <i>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</i> in time. The antitoxin, produced in horses, is in short supply worldwide; the market is too small to make production profitable. The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention is planning to highlight the shortage in a report expected early in 2017 that will also address Europe's diagnostic capacity for diphtheria. Meanwhile, researchers are trying to make the antitoxin in cell culture, which could help shore up production and improve quality.</p>

Microstructural proliferation in human cortex is coupled with the development of face processing
<p>How does cortical tissue change as brain function and behavior improve from childhood to adulthood? By combining quantitative and functional magnetic resonance imaging in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and adults, we find differential development of high-level visual areas that are involved in face and place recognition. Development of face-selective regions, but not place-selective regions, is dominated by microstructural proliferation. This tissue development is correlated with specific increases in functional selectivity to faces, as well as improvements in face recognition, and ultimately leads to differentiated tissue properties between face- and place-selective regions in adulthood, which we validate with postmortem cytoarchitectonic measurements. These data suggest a new model by which emergent brain function and behavior result from cortical tissue proliferation rather than from pruning exclusively.</p>

Building connections
<p>Much of a child's first year is spent asleep, punctuated by the occasional feeding, fit, or flatulence. The serenity is only skin deep, as a flurry of action goes on beneath.

Remarkably, speed does not incur a cost in precision—<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> reach their first birthday with specific, largely mature patterns of connectivity already formed, ready to become terrible at 2.

Antibodies to PfSEA-1 block parasite egress from RBCs and protect against malaria infection
<p>Novel vaccines are urgently needed to reduce the burden of severe malaria. Using a differential whole-proteome screening method, we identified <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> schizont egress antigen-1 (PfSEA-1), a 244-kilodalton parasite antigen expressed in schizont-infected red blood cells (RBCs). Antibodies to PfSEA-1 decreased parasite replication by arresting schizont rupture, and conditional disruption of PfSEA-1 resulted in a profound parasite replication defect. Vaccination of mice with recombinant <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> PbSEA-1 significantly reduced parasitemia and delayed mortality after lethal challenge with the <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> strain ANKA. Tanzanian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with antibodies to recombinant PfSEA-1A (rPfSEA-1A) did not experience severe malaria, and Kenyan adolescents and adults with antibodies to rPfSEA-1A had significantly lower parasite densities than individuals without these antibodies. By blocking schizont egress, PfSEA-1 may synergize with other vaccines targeting hepatocyte and RBC invasion.</p>

Quantification of the ossification of the lateral cuneiform in the feet of young children with unilateral congenital talipes equinovarus
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>After the initial correction of congenital talipes equinovarus   (CTEV) using the Ponseti method, a subsequent dynamic deformity   is often managed by transfer of the tendon of tibialis anterior   (TATT) to the lateral cuneiform. Many surgeons believe the lateral   cuneiform should be ossified before surgery is undertaken.

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in skeletally immature patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Different methods of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction   have been described for skeletally immature patients before closure   of the growth plates. However, the outcome and complications following   this treatment remain unclear. The aim of this systematic review   was to analyse the outcome and complications of different techniques   which may be used for reconstruction of the ACL in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We performed a systematic review of the literature according   to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines. This involved a comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline,   CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase and Google Scholar databases using the   following combinations of keywords, “knee”, “anterior cruciate ligament”,   “reconstruction”, “injury”, “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>”, “adolescent”, “skeletally   immature”, “open physis” and “surgery”.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 53 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included   for analysis. The overall rate of disturbance of growth after ACL   reconstruction was 2.6%, with no statistical difference between   transphyseal and physeal-sparing techniques.

Staged lengthening and reconstruction for children with a leg-length discrepancy after excision of an osteosarcoma around the knee
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> treated for osteosarcoma around the knee often have   a substantial leg-length discrepancy at skeletal maturity. The aim   of this study was to investigate the results of staged skeletal   reconstruction after a leg lengthening procedure using an external   fixator in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 11 patients who underwent staged reconstruction with   either an arthroplasty (n = 6) or an arthrodesis (n = 5). A control   group of 11 patients who had undergone wide excision and concurrent   reconstruction with an arthroplasty were matched for gender, location,   and size of tumour. We investigated the change in leg-length discrepancy,   function as assessed by the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Scale   (MSTS) score and complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A mean 5.2 cm (1.7 to 8.9) of lengthening was achieved. The mean   MSTS scores significantly improved after staged reconstruction (p   = 0.003) but were still worse than those of the control group (p   = 0.049). However, the MSTS scores of the arthroplasty subgroup   were comparable with those of the controls, although the extensor   lag was greater and the range of movement was less.

Quantifying the ‘law of diminishing returns’ in magnetically controlled growing rods
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) allow non-invasive   correction of the spinal deformity in the treatment of early-onset   scoliosis. Conventional growing rod systems (CGRS) need repeated   surgical distractions: these are associated with the effect of the   ‘law of diminishing returns’.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to quantify this effect in   MCGRs over sequential distractions. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 35 patients with a maximum follow-up of 57 months   were included in the study. There were 17 boys and 18 girls with   a mean age of 7.4 years (2 to 14). True Distraction (TD) was determined   by measuring the expansion gap on fluoroscopy. This was compared   with Intended Distraction (ID) and expressed as the ‘T/I’ ratio.   The T/I ratio and the Cobb angle were calculated at several time   points during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 30 months (6 to 57). There was a significant   decrease in the mean T/I ratio over time (convex rod at 3 months   0.81, <sc>sd</sc> 0.58 <i>vs</i> 51 months 0.17, <sc>sd </sc>0.16,    p = 0.0001; concave rod at 3 months 0.93, <sc>sd</sc> 0.67 <i>vs</i> 51   months 0.18, <sc>sd</sc> 0.15, p = 0.0001). A linear decline of   the mean T/I ratios was noted for both convex rods (r<sup>2</sup> =   0.90, p = 0.004) and concave rods (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.81, p = 0.015)   over 51 months. At the 24-month follow-up stage, there was a significant   negative correlation between the mean T/I ratio of the concave rod   with weight (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), age (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), and   BMI of the child (r = -0.54,    p = 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ‘law of diminishing returns’ is also seen after serial distraction   using MCGR.

What is the morbidity of a non-invasive growing prosthesis?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Extendible endoprostheses have been available for more than 30   years and have become more sophisticated with time. The latest generation   is ‘non-invasive’ and can be lengthened with an external magnetic   force. Early results have shown a worryingly high rate of complications   such as infection. This study investigates the incidence of complications   and the need for further surgery in a cohort of patients with a   non-invasive growing endoprosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2003 and June 2014, 50 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> (51 prostheses) had a   non-invasive growing prosthesis implanted for a primary bone sarcoma.   The minimum follow-up was 24 months for those who survived. Their   mean age was 10.4 years (6 to 14). The incidence of complications   and further surgery was documented.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 64 months (20 to 145). The overall survivorship   of the patients was 84% at three years and 70% at five years. Revision-free   survival was 81.7% at three years and 61.6% at five years with competing   risk analysis. Deep infection occurred in 19.6% of implants at a   mean of 12.5 months (0 to 55). Other complications were a failure   of the lengthening mechanism in five prostheses (9.8%) and breakage   of the implant in two (3.9%). Overall, there were 53 additional   operations (0 to 5 per patient). A total of seven patients (14%)   underwent amputation, three for local recurrence and four for infection.   Their mean limb length discrepancy was 4.3 mm (0 to 25) and mean Musculoskeletal   Tumor Society Score functional score was 26.5 (18 to 30) at the   final follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>When compared with previously published early results, this mid-term   series has shown continued good functional outcomes and compensation   for leg-length discrepancy. Infection is still the most common complication:   post-operative wound healing problems, central line infection and   proximal tibial location are the main risk factors.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1697–1703.</p></sec>

At 6 years, we compared transplant-free survival and other outcomes between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medical history was collected annually using medical record review, telephone interviews, and the death index. The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Transplant-free survival for the RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt groups did not differ at 6 years (64% versus 59%, <i>P</i>=0.25) or with all available follow-up of 7.1±1.6 years (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.13). The RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt treatment effect had nonproportional hazards (<i>P</i>=0.009); the hazard ratio (HR) for death or transplant favored the RVPAS before stage II surgery (HR, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.92). The effect of shunt type on death or transplant was not statistically significant between stage II to Fontan surgery (HR, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–2.17; <i>P</i>=0.17) or after the Fontan procedure (HR, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–1.74; <i>P</i>=0.52). By 6 years, patients with RVPAS had a higher incidence of catheter interventions (0.38 versus 0.23/patient-year, <i>P</i><0.001), primarily because of more interventions between the stage II and Fontan procedures (HR, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–3.03). Complications did not differ by shunt type; by 6 years, 1 in 5 patients had had a thrombotic event, and 1 in 6 had had seizures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>By 6 years, the hazards of death or transplant and catheter interventions were not different between the RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt groups. Children assigned to the RVPAS group had 5% higher transplant-free survival, but the difference did not reach statistical significance, and they required more catheter interventions. Both treatment groups have accrued important complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Time to Epinephrine Administration and Survival From Nonshockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Among Children and Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that earlier epinephrine administration is associated with improved survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable initial rhythms. However, the effect of epinephrine timing on patients with nonshockable initial rhythms is unclear. The objective of this study was to measure the association between time to epinephrine administration and survival in adults and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with emergency medical services (EMS)–treated OHCA with nonshockable initial rhythms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of OHCAs prospectively identified by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium network from June 4, 2011, to June 30, 2015. We included patients of all ages with an EMS-treated OHCA and an initial nonshockable rhythm. We excluded those with return of spontaneous circulation in <10 minutes. We conducted a subgroup analysis involving patients <18 years of age. The primary exposure was time (minutes) from arrival of the first EMS agency to the first dose of epinephrine. Secondary exposure was time to epinephrine dichotomized as early (<10 minutes) or late (≥10 minutes). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. We adjusted for Utstein covariates and Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium study site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 55 568 EMS-treated OHCAs, 32 101 patients with initial nonshockable rhythms were included. There were 12 238 in the early group, 14 517 in the late group, and 5346 not treated with epinephrine. After adjusting for potential confounders, each minute from EMS arrival to epinephrine administration was associated with a 4% decrease in odds of survival for adults, odds ratio=0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.98). A subgroup analysis (n=13 290) examining neurological outcomes showed a similar association (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94 per minute; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.98). When epinephrine was given late in comparison with early, odds of survival were 18% lower (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.98). In a pediatric analysis (n=595), odds of survival were 9% lower (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.01) for each minute delay in epinephrine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among OHCAs with nonshockable initial rhythms, the majority of patients were administered epinephrine >10 minutes after EMS arrival. Each minute delay in epinephrine administration was associated with decreased survival and unfavorable neurological outcomes. EMS agencies should consider strategies to reduce epinephrine administration times in patients with initial nonshockable rhythms.</p></sec>

Risk of Dementia in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>More <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with congenital heart disease (CHD) are surviving to adulthood, and CHD is associated with risk factors for dementia. We compared the risk of dementia in CHD adults to that of the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this cohort study, we used medical registries and a medical record review covering all Danish hospitals to identify adults with CHD diagnosed between 1963 and 2012. These individuals with CHD were followed from January 1, 1981, 30 years of age, or date of first CHD registration (index date for matched members of the general population cohort) until hospital diagnosis of dementia, death, emigration, or end of study (December 31, 2012). For each individual with CHD, we identified 10 members of the general population utilizing the Danish Civil Registration System matched on sex and birth year. We computed cumulative incidences and hazard ratios (HRs) of dementia, adjusting for sex and birth year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cumulative incidence of dementia was 4% by 80 years of age in 10 632 adults with CHD (46% male). The overall HR comparing adults with CHD with the general population cohort was 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3−2.0). The HR among individuals with CHD without extracardiac defects was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1−1.8). Adults with mild-to-moderate CHD had an HR of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1−2.0), whereas the HR was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2−3.3) for severe CHD, including univentricular hearts. The HR for early onset dementia (<65 years of age) was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.8−3.8), whereas the late-onset HR was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.0−1.8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CHD was associated with an increased risk of dementia compared with the general population, in particular for early onset dementia. Further understanding of dementia risk in the population with CHD is a potential target for future investigation.</p></sec>

Wide Variation in Reported Rates of Stroke Across Cohorts of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Oral anticoagulants decrease ischemic stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increase the risk of bleeding. For the average patient with AF, the threshold of annual ischemic stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> where the benefit of anticoagulation outweighs the bleeding risk (net clinical benefit) has been shown to be ≈1% to 2%. Guideline recommendations for oral anticoagulants in AF are based on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc stroke risk point scores, assuming that those scores translate to fixed stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. However, the relationship between stroke point scores and annual stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s may vary substantially across populations. We sought to comprehensively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> the reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of stroke in patients with AF and the relationship of stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s to stroke risk point scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic review of cohort studies and randomized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trials enrolled patients with nonvalvular AF not treated with oral anticoagulants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 3552 studies screened, we identified 34 studies eligible for analysis. Overall stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in cohort studies were highly heterogeneous (Q=5706.54, <i>P</i><0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.6%) and ranged from 0.45% to 9.28% per year, despite being of similar objective study quality. The mean North American stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was less than one-third that of the mean European stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, a random effects regression indicated that between-study variability was not significantly accounted for by cohort region, prospective versus retrospective design, calendar year of study, or outcome event cluster. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1, 76% of cohorts reported ischemic stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s <1% per year and only 18% of cohorts reported a stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> >2% per year. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 2, 27% of cohorts reported stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s below 1% per year, 40% reported stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s between 1 and 2% per year, and 33% reported stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s >2% per year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Substantial variation exists across cohorts in overall stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s corresponding to CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc point scores.

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> knowledge of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> provides a base line for inferring expected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. We confirm that the crossover <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s: we estimate for bumblebees a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> in insects.</p>

AEs were analyzed sepa<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>ly for the parent and OLE trials. Overall AE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s, serious AEs, laboratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ments, and AEs of interest were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall AE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s were similar between evolocumab and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> in the parent trials (51.1% versus 49.6%) and in year 1 of OLE trials (70.0% versus 66.0%), as were those for serious AEs. Elevations of serum transaminases, bilirubin, and creatine kinase were infrequent and similar between groups. Muscle-related AEs were similar between evolocumab and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. Neurocognitive AEs were infrequent and balanced during the double-blind parent studies (5 events [0.1%], evolocumab groups versus 6 events [0.3%], <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> groups). In the OLE trials, 27 patients (0.9%) in the evolocumab groups and 5 patients (0.3%) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> groups reported neurocognitive AEs.

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data are lacking on national trends for atrial fibrillation (AF) hospitalization, particularly with regard to long-term outcomes including readmission and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries between 1999 and 2013, and we evaluated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of hospitalization for AF, in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and hospital payments.

To evaluate changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of AF hospitalization and mortality, we used mixed-effects models, adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidity. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of 30-day readmission, we constructed a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of hospitalization for AF increased by ≈1% per year between 1999 and 2013, and although geographic variation was present, this trend was consistent nationwide.

Hospital Variation in Time to Epinephrine for Nonshockable In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>For patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests attributable to nonshockable rhythms, delays in epinephrine administration beyond 5 minutes is associated with worse survival. However, the extent of hospital variation in delayed epinephrine administration and its effect on hospital-level outcomes is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Within Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation, we identified 103 932 adult patients (≥18 years) at 548 hospitals with an in-hospital cardiac arrest attributable to a nonshockable rhythm who received at least 1 dose of epinephrine between 2000 and 2014. We constructed 2-level hierarchical regression models to quantify hospital variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of delayed epinephrine administration (>5 minutes) and its association with hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of survival to discharge and survival with functional recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 13 213 (12.7%) patients had delays to epinephrine, and this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> varied markedly across hospitals (range, 0%–53.8%). The odds of delay in epinephrine administration were 58% higher at 1 randomly selected hospital in comparison with a similar patient at another randomly selected hospital (median odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.51–1.64). The median risk-standardized survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 12.0% (range, 5.4%–31.9%), and the risk-standardized survival with functional recovery was 7.4% (range, 0.9%–30.8%).

Specialized Adult Congenital Heart Disease Care
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Clinical guidelines recommend specialized care for adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients. In reality, few patients receive such dedicated care. We sought to examine the impact of specialized care on ACHD patient mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined referral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s to specialized ACHD centers and ACHD patient mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s between 1990 and 2005 in the population-based Quebec Congenital Heart Disease database (n=71 467). This period covers several years before and after the publication of guidelines endorsing specialized care for ACHD patients. A time-series design, based on Joinpoint and Poisson regression analyses, was used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> the changes in annual referral and patient mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. The association between specialized ACHD care and all-cause mortality was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed in both case–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> and cohort studies. The time-series analysis demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d a significant increase in referral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s to specialized ACHD centers in 1997 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> ratio, +7.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], +6.6% to +8.2%). In parallel, a significant reduction in expected ACHD patient mortality was observed after year 2000 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> ratio, −5.0%;95% CI, −10.8% to −0.8%). In exploratory post hoc cohort and case–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> analyses, specialized ACHD care was independently associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.94) and a reduced odds of death (adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.08–0.97), respectively.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Novel Mechanism, Linked to Cell Density, Largely Controls Cell Division in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>Many studies have investigated the various genetic and environmental factors regulating cyanobacterial growth. Here, we investigated the growth and metabolism of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 under different nitrogen sources, light intensities, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Cells grown on urea showed the highest growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. However, for all conditions tested, the daily growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in batch cultures decreased steadily over time, and stationary phase was obtained with similar cell densities. Unexpectedly, metabolic and physiological analyses showed that growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s during log phase were not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led primarily by the availability of photoassimilates. Further physiological investigations indicated that nutrient limitation, quorum sensing, light quality, and light intensity (self-shading) were not the main factors responsible for the decrease in the growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> and the onset of the stationary phase. Moreover, cell division <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in fed-batch cultures were positively correlated with the dilution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. Hence, not only light, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nutrients can affect growth but also a cell-cell interaction. Accordingly, we propose that cell-cell interaction may be a factor responsible for the gradual decrease of growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in batch cultures during log phase, culminating with the onset of stationary phase.</p>

Impact of summer drought on isoprenoid emissions and carbon sink of three Scots pine provenances
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) provenances cover broad ecological amplitudes. In a greenhouse study, we investigated the impact of drought stress and rewetting on gas exchange for three provenances (Italy: Emilia Romagna; Spain: Alto Ebro; Germany: East-German lowlands) of 2-year old Scots pine seedlings. CO<sub>2</sub>, water vapour and isoprenoid exchange of stressed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> trees were quantified with a four-chamber dynamic-enclosure system in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led environment of a climate chamber. The three provenances showed distinct isoprenoid emission patterns and were classified into a non-Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene, with either high α-/β-pinene or β-myrcene fraction, and a Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene dominated type. Isoprenoid emission <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s, net-photosynthesis and transpiration were reduced during summer drought stress and significantly recovered after rewetting. A seasonal increase of isoprenoid emission <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s towards autumn was observed for all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> groups. Compared with the German provenance, the Spanish and Italian provenances revealed higher isoprenoid emission <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and more plastic responses to drought stress and seasonal development, which points to a local adaptation to climate. As a result of drought, net carbon uptake and transpiration of trees was reduced, but recovered after rewetting. We conclude from our study that Scots pine isoprenoid emission is more variable than expected and sensitive to drought periods, likely impacting regional air chemistry. Thus, a provenance-specific emission <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment accounting for reduced emission during prolonged (summer) drought is recommend for setting up biogenic volatile organic compound emission inventories used in air quality models.</p>

Human mutation rate a legacy from our past
<p>Humans should be more like paramecia. That's because their mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> is orders of magnitude lower than a human's. Those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s increase when genes involved in copying or repairing DNA stop working correctly. Although some mutations are good for generating variety that allows organisms to adapt to changing environments, too many can cause disease and birth defects. At a meeting in Tempe, Arizona, researchers documented mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in dozens of species and found that the species's specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> is inversely related to the so-called "effective population" size. Small populations are less able to get rid of or compensate for genetic changes that increase mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. In the past, mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s were thought to be so stable that they were "molecular clocks" useful for dating species' divergences. But researchers are now recognizing that mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s vary from species to species.</p>

We critically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> and drinking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s ability   to bear weight, but historically, operative fixation has been associated   with a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of re-operation. In this study, we describe the outcomes   of fixation using modern implants within a st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>gy of early return   to function.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients treated at our centre with lateral distal femoral   locking plates (LDFLP) between 2009 and 2014 were identified. Fracture   classification and operative information including weight-bearing   status, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of union, re-operation, failure of implants and mortality   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>, were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 127 fractures were identified in 122 patients. The   mean age was 72.8 years (16 to 101) and 92 of the patients (75%)   were female. A consultant performed the operation in 85 of the cases,   (67%) with the remainder performed under direct consultant supervision.   In total 107 patients (84%) were allowed to bear full weight immediately.   The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of clinical and radiological union was 81/85 (95%) and   only four fractures of 127 (3%) fractures required re-operation   for failure of surgery.

Dislocation of a primary total hip arthroplasty is more common in patients with a lumbar spinal fusion
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Lumbar fusion is known to reduce the variation in pelvic tilt   between standing and sitting. A flexible lumbo-pelvic unit increases   the stability of total hip arthroplasty (THA) when seated by increasing   anterior clearance and acetabular anteversion, thereby preventing   impingement of the prosthesis. Lumbar fusion may eliminate this protective   pelvic movement. The effect of lumbar fusion on the stability of   total hip arthroplasty has not previously been investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The Medicare database was searched for patients who had undergone   THA and spinal fusion between 2005 and 2012. PearlDiver software   was used to query the database by the International Classification   of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedural   code for primary THA and lumbar spinal fusion. Patients who had   undergone both lumbar fusion and THA were then divided into three   groups: 1 to 2 levels, 3 to 7 levels and 8+ levels of fusion. The   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of dislocation in each group was established using ICD-9-CM codes.   Patients who underwent THA without spinal fusion were used as a   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group. Statistical significant difference between groups   was tested using the chi-squared test, and significance set at p   < 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At one-year follow-up, 14 747 patients were found to have had   a THA after lumbar spinal fusion (12 079 1 to 2 levels, 2594 3 to   7 levels, 74 8+ levels). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group consisted of 839 004   patients. The dislocation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group was 1.55%. A   higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of dislocation was found in patients with a spinal fusion   of 1 to 2 levels (2.96%, p < 0.0001) and 3 to 7 levels (4.12%,   p < 0.0001). Patients with 3 to 7 levels of fusion had a higher   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of dislocation than patients with 1 to 2 levels of fusion (odds   ratio (OR) = 1.60, p < 0.0001). When groups were matched for   age and gender to the unfused cohort, patients with 1 to 2 levels   of fusion had an OR of 1.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to   2.32, p < 0.001), and those with 3 to 7 levels of fusion an OR   of 2.77 (CI 2.04 to 4.80, p < 0.001) for dislocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with a previous history of lumbar spinal fusion have   a significantly higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of dislocation of their THA than age-   and gender-matched patients without a lumbar spinal fusion.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:585–91.</p></sec>

Mortality and Cerebrovascular Events After Heart Rhythm Disorder Management Procedures
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of death and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder management (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in electrophysiology laboratories. Our primary aim was to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> and characterize death and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital deaths and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of death and CVE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s was performed for ablation, device implantation, electrophysiology study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively. Patients undergoing lead extraction had the highest overall mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> at 1.9% (95% CI, 1.34–2.61) and CVE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> at 0.62% (95% CI, 0.32–1.07). Among patients undergoing HRDM procedures, 48% of deaths directly related to the HDRM procedure were among patients undergoing device implantation procedures. Overall, cardiac tamponade was the most frequent direct cause of death (40%), and infection was the most common indirect cause of death (29%). The overall 30-day mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 0.76%, with the highest being in lead extraction procedures (3.08%), followed by device implantation procedures (0.94%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Half of the deaths directly related to an HRDM procedure were among the patients undergoing device implantation procedures, with cardiac tamponade being the most common cause of death. This highlights the importance of the development of protocols for the quick identification and management of cardiac tamponade even in procedures typically believed to be lower risk such as device implantation.</p></sec>

Global Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Heart Failure and Preserved or Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We hypothesized that pulmonary venous hypertension in heart failure (HF) leads to predominate remodeling of pulmonary veins and that the severity of venous remodeling is associated with the severity of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with HF (n=108; 53 preserved and 55 reduced ejection fraction) with PH (HF-PH; pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] ≥40 mm Hg) were compared to normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (n=12) and patients with primary pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD; n=17). In lung specimens from autopsy (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, HF-PH, and 7 PVOD) or surgery (10 PVOD), quantitative histomorphometry was performed in all analyzable arteries (n=4949), veins (n=7630), and small indeterminate vessels (IV; n=2168) to define percent medial thickness (arteries) and percent intimal thickness (%IT) (arteries, veins, and IV) relative to external diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average arterial percent medial thickness (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 6.9; HF-PH, 11.0; PVOD, 15.0), arterial %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 4.9; HF-PH, 14.9; PVOD, 31.1), venous %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 14.0; HF-PH, 24.9; PVOD, 43.9), and IV %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 10.6; HF-PH, 25.8; PVOD, 50.0) in HF-PH were higher than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but lower than PVOD (<i>P</i>≤0.005 for all). PASP (mm Hg) was lower in HF-PH (median, 59 [interquartile range, 50–70]) than in PVOD (median, 91 [interquartile range, 82–103]). PASP correlated with arterial percent medial thickness (<i>r</i>=0.41) and arterial %IT (<i>r</i>=0.35) but more strongly with venous %IT (<i>r</i>=0.49) and IV %IT (<i>r</i>=0.55) (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all). Associations between PASP and venous or IV %IT remained significant after adjusting for arterial percent medial thickness and %IT and did not vary by HF type. In patients with right heart catheterization (30 HF-PH, 14 PVOD), similar associations between the transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular remodeling existed, with numerically stronger associations for venous and IV %IT. Although the PASP was slightly higher in patients with HF-PH with right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary vascular remodeling was not more severe. Pulmonary vascular remodeling severity was associated with reductions in the diffusing capacity of the lungs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In HF, PH is associated with global pulmonary vascular remodeling, but the severity of PH correlates most strongly with venous and small IV intimal thickening, similar to the pattern observed in PVOD. These findings expand our understanding of the pathobiology of PH in HF.</p></sec>

Age-Specific Trends in Incidence, Mortality, and Comorbidities of Heart Failure in Denmark, 1995 to 2012
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The cumulative burden and importance of cardiovascular risk factors have changed over the past decades. Specifically, obesity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s have increased among younger people, whereas cardiovascular health has improved in the elderly. Little is known regarding how these changes have impacted the incidence and the mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of heart failure. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the age-specific trends in the incidence and 1-year mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s following a first-time diagnosis of heart failure in Denmark between 1995 and 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included all Danish individuals >18 years of age with a first-time in-hospital diagnosis of heart failure. Data were collected from 3 nationwide Danish registries.

Repeat Coronary Revascularization After Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>A major advantage of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) relative to percutaneous coronary intervention is its durability, yet there is a paucity of information on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and predictors of repeat coronary revascularization after CABG in the modern era.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We included patients ≥65 years from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons’ National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database who were undergoing first-time isolated CABG from 1991 to 2007 (n=723 134, median age 73 years). After linking to Medicare claims data, long-term outcomes of CABG (up to 18 years after surgery) were examined by use of cumulative incidence curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to identify factors associated with 1- and 5-year repeat revascularization trends and variability. We found that the overall 18-year survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 20%. Cumulative incidences of any repeat revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG, yet most often percutaneous coronary intervention) were 2%, 7%, 13%, and 16% at 1, 5, 10, and 18 years after surgery, respectively. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of repeat CABG procedures were quite low for all time points (0.1%, 0.6%, 1.3%, and 1.7%, respectively). Female sex, disease severity represented by a history of percutaneous coronary intervention, preoperative dialysis, and partial revascularization were strongly associated with a higher revascularization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>, whereas advanced age, left main disease, and smoking were associated with a lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>.

The outcome and complications of vascularised fibular grafts
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Free vascularised fibular grafting has been used for the treatment   of large bony defects for more than 40 years. However, there is   little information about the risk factors for failure and whether   newer locking techniques of fixation improve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of union.   The purpose of this study was to compare the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of union of free   fibular grafts fixed with locking and traditional techniques, and   to quantify the risk factors for nonunion and failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review involved 134 consecutive procedures over   a period of 20 years. Of these, 25 were excluded leaving 109 patients   in the study. There were 66 men and 43 women, with a mean age of   33 years (5 to 78). Most (62) were performed for oncological indications,   and the most common site (52) was the lower limb. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of union   was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and risk factors for   nonunion were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed using Cox regression.

Ten-year follow-up study of three alternative bearing surfaces used in total hip arthroplasty in young patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present the ten-year data of a cohort of patients, aged between   18 and 65 years (mean age 52.7 years; 19 to 64), who underwent total   hip arthroplasty. Patients were randomised to be treated with a   cobalt-chrome (CoCr) femoral head with an ultra-high molecular weight   polyethylene (UHMWPE), highly cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) or   ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearing surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 102 hips (91 patients) were randomised into the three   groups. At ten years, 97 hips were available for radiological and   functional follow-up. Two hips (two patients) had been revised (one   with deep infection and one for periprosthetic fracture) and three   were lost to follow-up. Radiological analysis was performed using   a validated digital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment programme to give linear, directional   and volumetric wear of the two polyethylene groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was a significantly reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of steady-state linear   wear with XLPE (0.07 mm/yr) compared with UHMWPE (0.37 mm/yr) (p   = 0.001). Volumetric wear was also significantly reduced in the   XLPE group (29.29 mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) compared with the UHMWPE group   (100.75mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) (p = 0.0001). There were six patients   with UHMWPE who had non-progressive osteolysis and none in the XLPE   group. All three bearing groups had significant improvements in   12-item short form health survey scores, Western Ontario and McMaster   Universities Osteoarthritis Index score and Harris Hip Score.

The effect of a single early high-dose vitamin D supplement on fracture union in patients with hypovitaminosis D
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the effect of a single early high-dose vitamin D   supplement on fracture union in patients with hypovitaminosis D   and a long bone fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between July 2011 and August 2013, 113 adults with a long bone   fracture were enrolled in a prospective randomised double-blind   placebo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial. Their serum vitamin D levels were measured   and a total of 100 patients were found to be vitamin D deficient   (< 20 ng/ml) or insufficient (< 30 ng/mL). These were then   randomised to receive a single dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> orally   (100 000 IU) within two weeks of injury (treatment group, n = 50)   or a placebo (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group, n = 50).

Transcatheter Interatrial Shunt Device for the Treatment of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (REDUCE LAP-HF I [Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In nonrandomized, open-label studies, a transcatheter interatrial shunt device (IASD, Corvia Medical) was associated with lower pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), fewer symptoms, and greater quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure (HF) and midrange or preserved ejection fraction (EF ≥40%). We conducted the first randomized sham-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial to evaluate the IASD in HF with EF ≥40%.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REDUCE LAP-HF I (Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure) was a phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, blinded multicenter trial in patients with New York Heart Association class III or ambulatory class IV HF, EF ≥40%, exercise PCWP ≥25 mm Hg, and PCWP-right atrial pressure gradient ≥5 mm Hg. Participants were randomized (1:1) to the IASD versus a sham procedure (femoral venous access with intracardiac echocardiography but no IASD placement). The participants and investigators <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ing the participants during follow-up were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary effectiveness end point was exercise PCWP at 1 month. The primary safety end point was major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal events at 1 month. PCWP during exercise was compared between treatment groups using a mixed-effects repeated measures model analysis of covariance that included data from all available stages of exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 94 patients were enrolled, of whom 44 met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were randomized to the IASD (n=22) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> (n=22) groups. Mean age was 70±9 years, and 50% were female. At 1 month, the IASD resulted in a greater reduction in PCWP compared with sham <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> (<i>P</i>=0.028 accounting for all stages of exercise). Peak PCWP decreased by 3.5±6.4 mm Hg in the treatment group versus 0.5±5.0 mm Hg in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group (<i>P</i>=0.14). There were no peri-procedural or 1-month major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal events in the IASD group and 1 event (worsening renal function) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group (<i>P</i>=1.0).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with HF and EF ≥40%, IASD treatment reduces PCWP during exercise.

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have a far worse prognosis than those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). In the intact heart, SSc-PAH exhibits depressed rest and reserve right ventricular (RV) contractility compared with IPAH. We tested whether this disparity involves underlying differences in myofilament function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac myocytes were isolated from RV septal endomyocardial biopsies from patients with SSc-PAH, IPAH, or SSc with exertional dyspnea but no resting PAH (SSc-d); <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> RV septal tissue was obtained from nondiseased donor hearts (6–7 per group). Isolated myocyte passive length-tension and developed tension-calcium relationships were determined and correlated with in vivo RV function and reserve. RV septal fibrosis was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocyte passive stiffness from length-tension relations was similarly increased in IPAH and SSc-PAH compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, although SSc-PAH biopsies had more interstitial fibrosis. More striking disparities were found between active force-calcium relations. Compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s, maximal calcium-activated force (F<sub>max</sub>) was 28% higher in IPAH but 37% lower in SSc-PAH. F<sub>max</sub> in SSc-d was intermediate between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> and SSc-PAH. The calcium concentration required for half-maximal force (EC<sub>50</sub>) was similar between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, IPAH, and SSc-d but lower in SSc-PAH. This disparity disappeared in myocytes incubated with the active catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Myocyte F<sub>max</sub> directly correlated with in vivo RV contractility <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed by end-systolic elastance (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.46, <i>P</i>=0.002) and change in end-systolic elastance with exercise (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.49, <i>P</i>=0.008) and was inversely related with exercise-induced chamber dilation (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.63, <i>P</i><0.002), which also was a marker of depressed contractile reserve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A primary defect in human SSc-PAH resides in depressed sarcomere function, whereas this is enhanced in IPAH. These disparities correlate with in vivo RV contractility and contractile reserve and are consistent with worse clinical outcomes in SSc-PAH. The existence of sarcomere disease before the development of resting PAH in patients with SSc-d suggests that earlier identification and intervention may prove useful.</p></sec>

Status of Hypertension in China
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although the prevalence of hypertension (HTN) continues to increase in developing countries, including China, recent data are lacking. A nationwide survey was conducted from October 2012 to December 2015 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> the prevalence of HTN in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A stratified multistage random sampling method was used to obtain a nationally representative sample of 451 755 residents ≥18 years of age from 31 provinces in mainland China from October 2012 to December 2015. Blood pressure (BP) was measured after resting for 5 minutes by trained staff using a validated oscillometric BP monitor. HTN was defined as systolic BP (SBP) ≥140 mm Hg/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication within 2 weeks.

Age and Outcomes of Primary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The DANISH study (Danish Study to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> the Efficacy of ICDs [Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators] in Patients With Non-Ischemic Systolic Heart Failure on Mortality) did not demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> an overall effect on all-cause mortality with ICD implantation. However, the prespecified subgroup analysis suggested a possible age-dependent association between ICD implantation and mortality with survival benefit seen only in the youngest patients. The nature of this relationship between age and outcome of a primary prevention ICD in patients with nonischemic systolic heart failure warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All 1116 patients from the DANISH study were included in this prespecified subgroup analysis. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed the relationship between ICD implantation and mortality by age, and an optimal age cutoff was estimated nonparametrically with selection impact curves. Modes of death were divided into sudden cardiac death and nonsudden death and compared between patients younger and older than this age cutoff with the use of χ<sup>2</sup> analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Median age of the study population was 63 years (range, 21–84 years). There was a linearly decreasing relationship between ICD and mortality with age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003–1.06; <i>P</i>=0.03). An optimal age cutoff for ICD implantation was present at ≤70 years. There was an association between reduced all-cause mortality and ICD in patients ≤70 years of age (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.96; <i>P</i>=0.03) but not in patients >70 years of age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.68–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.84). For patients ≤70 years old, the sudden cardiac death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.5) and nonsudden death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1–3.5) events per 100 patient-years, whereas for patients >70 years old, the sudden cardiac death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8–3.2) and nonsudden death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 5.4 (95% CI, 3.7–7.8) events per 100 patient-years.

Mediterranean Diet Improves High-Density Lipoprotein Function in High-Cardiovascular-Risk Individuals
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The biological functions of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) contribute to explaining the cardioprotective role of the lipoprotein beyond quantitative HDL cholesterol levels. A few small-scale interventions with a single antioxidant have improved some HDL functions. However, to date, no long-term, large-scale, randomized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial has been conducted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> the effects of an antioxidant-rich dietary pattern (such as a traditional Mediterranean diet [TMD]) on HDL function in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was performed in a random subsample of volunteers from the PREDIMED Study (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea; n=296) after a 1-year intervention. We compared the effects of 2 TMDs, one enriched with virgin olive oil (TMD-VOO; n=100) and the other enriched with nuts (TMD-Nuts; n=100), with respect to a low-fat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> diet (n=96). We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed the effects of both TMDs on the role of HDL particles on reverse cholesterol transport (cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL ability to esterify cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity), HDL antioxidant properties (paraoxonase-1 arylesterase activity and total HDL antioxidant capacity on low-density lipoproteins), and HDL vasodilatory capacity (HDL ability to induce the release of nitric oxide in endothelial cells). We also studied the effects of a TMD on several HDL quality-related characteristics (HDL particle oxidation, resistance against oxidative modification, main lipid and protein composition, and size distribution).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both TMDs increased cholesterol efflux capacity relative to baseline (<i>P</i>=0.018 and <i>P</i>=0.013 for TMD-VOO and TMD-Nuts, respectively).

Diagnosis and Treatment of Fetal Cardiac Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The goal of this statement is to review available literature and to put forth a scientific statement on the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis and management of fetal cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association reviewed the available literature pertaining to topics relevant to fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and arrhythmias, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment of cardiac function and the cardiovascular system, and available treatment options. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal diagnosis, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical management for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for diseases affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>gies to prevent the progression of disease in utero are also discussed. Recommendations for delivery planning st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>gies for fetuses with congenital heart disease including models based on classification of disease severity and delivery room treatment will be highlighted. Outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment is reviewed to show the benefit of prenatal diagnosis and management as they affect outcome for babies with congenital heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Fetal cardiac medicine has evolved considerably over the past 2 decades, predominantly in response to advances in imaging technology and innovations in therapies. The diagnosis of cardiac disease in the fetus is mostly made with ultrasound; however, new technologies, including 3- and 4-dimensional echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal electrocardiography and magnetocardiography, are available. Medical and interventional treatments for select diseases and st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>gies for delivery room care enable stabilization of high-risk fetuses and contribute to improved outcomes. This statement highlights what is currently known and recommended on the basis of evidence and experience in the rapidly advancing and highly specialized field of fetal cardiac care.</p></sec>

Epigenetic Dysregulation of the Dynamin-Related Protein 1 Binding Partners MiD49 and MiD51 Increases Mitotic Mitochondrial Fission and Promotes Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mitotic fission is increased in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant disease. The fission mediator dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) must complex with adaptor proteins to cause fission. Drp1-induced fission has been therapeutically targeted in experimental PAH. Here, we examine the role of 2 recently discovered, poorly understood Drp1 adapter proteins, mitochondrial dynamics protein of 49 and 51 kDa (MiD49 and MiD51), in normal vascular cells and explore their dysregulation in PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Immunoblots of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, n=6; PAH, n=8) and immunohistochemistry of lung sections (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, n=6; PAH, n=6) were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong> the expression of MiD49 and MiD51. The effects of manipulating MiDs on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed in human and rodent PAH pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells with flow cytometry. Mitochondrial fission was studied by confocal imaging. A microRNA (miR) involved in the regulation of MiD expression was identified using microarray techniques and in silico analyses. The expression of circulatory miR was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed with quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction in healthy volunteers (HVs) versus patients with PAH from Sheffield, UK (plasma: HV, n=29, PAH, n=27; whole blood: HV, n=11, PAH, n=14) and then confirmed in a cohort from Beijing, China (plasma: HV, n=19, PAH, n=36; whole blood: HV, n=20, PAH, n=39). This work was replicated in monocrotaline and Sugen 5416-hypoxia, preclinical PAH models. Small interfering RNAs targeting MiDs or an miR mimic were nebulized to rats with monocrotaline-induced PAH (n=4–10).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MiD expression is increased in PAH pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, which accele<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s Drp1-mediated mitotic fission, increases cell proliferation, and decreases apoptosis. Silencing MiDs (but not other Drp1 binding partners, fission 1 or mitochondrial fission factor) promotes mitochondrial fusion and causes G1-phase cell cycle arrest through extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2– and cyclin-dependent kinase 4–dependent mechanisms. Augmenting MiDs in normal cells causes fission and recapitulates the PAH phenotype. MiD upregulation results from decreased miR-34a-3p expression. Circulatory miR-34a-3p expression is decreased in both patients with PAH and preclinical models of PAH. Silencing MiDs or augmenting miR-34a-3p regresses experimental PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In health, MiDs regulate Drp1-mediated fission, whereas in disease, epigenetic upregulation of MiDs increases mitotic fission, which drives pathological proliferation and apoptosis resistance. The miR-34a-3p-MiD pathway offers new therapeutic targets for PAH.</p></sec>

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by birth year, sex, and county with 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden.

Mental Stress–Induced-Myocardial Ischemia in Young Patients With Recent Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received <sup>99m</sup>Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22–61). In the MI group but not among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22% versus 11%, <i>P</i>=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, <i>P</i>=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women’s proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.</p></sec>

Large Cardiac Muscle Patches Engineered From Human Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiac Cells Improve Recovery From Myocardial Infarction in Swine
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Here, we gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d human cardiac muscle patches (hCMPs) of clinically relevant dimensions (4 cm × 2 cm × 1.25 mm) by suspending cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells that had been differentiated from human induced-pluripotent stem cells in a fibrin scaffold and then culturing the construct on a dynamic (rocking) platform.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ments of hCMPs suggest maturation in response to dynamic culture stimulation. In vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ments were conducted in a porcine model of myocardial infarction (MI). Animal groups included: MI hearts treated with 2 hCMPs (MI+hCMP, n=13), MI hearts treated with 2 cell-free open fibrin patches (n=14), or MI hearts with neither experimental patch (n=15); a fourth group of animals underwent sham surgery (Sham, n=8). Cardiac function and infarct size were evaluated by MRI, arrhythmia incidence by implanted loop recorders, and the engraftment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> by calculation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of expression of the human Y chromosome. Additional studies examined the myocardial protein expression profile changes and potential mechanisms of action that related to exosomes from the cell patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The hCMPs began to beat synchronously within 1 day of fabrication, and after 7 days of dynamic culture stimulation, in vitro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ments indicated the mechanisms related to the improvements in electronic mechanical coupling, calcium-handling, and force generation, suggesting a maturation process during the dynamic culture. The engraftment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 10.9±1.8% at 4 weeks after the transplantation. The hCMP transplantation was associated with significant improvements in left ventricular function, infarct size, myocardial wall stress, myocardial hypertrophy, and reduced apoptosis in the periscar boarder zone myocardium. hCMP transplantation also reversed some MI-associated changes in sarcomeric regulatory protein phosphorylation. The exosomes released from the hCMP appeared to have cytoprotective properties that improved cardiomyocyte survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have fabricated a clinically relevant size of hCMP with trilineage cardiac cells derived from human induced-pluripotent stem cells. The hCMP matures in vitro during 7 days of dynamic culture. Transplantation of this type of hCMP results in significantly reduced infarct size and improvements in cardiac function that are associated with reduction in left ventricular wall stress. The hCMP treatment is not associated with significant changes in arrhythmogenicity.</p></sec>

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. The development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by curve fit of the diastolic pressure-volume curve. Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) was measured to quantify changes in fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (group×time <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-diastolic volume (group×time <i>P</i><0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was unchanged, providing greater stroke volume for any given filling pressure (loading×group×time <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and decreased cardiac stiffness. Regular exercise training may provide protection against the future risk of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction by preventing the increase in cardiac stiffness attributable to sedentary aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

PCSK9 Variants, Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, and Neurocognitive Impairment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Despite concerns about adverse neurocognitive events raised by prior trials, pharmacological PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9) inhibition was not associated with neurocognitive effects in a recent phase 3 randomized trial. PCSK9 loss-of-function (LOF) variants that result in lifelong exposure to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol can provide information on the potential long-term effects of lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on neurocognitive impairment and decline.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the association between PCSK9 LOF variants and neurocognitive impairment and decline among black REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) participants with (n=241) and without (n=10 454) C697X or Y142X LOF variants. Neurocognitive tests included the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) battery (Word List Learning, World List Delayed Recall, Semantic Animal Fluency) and Six-Item Screener (SIS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ments, administered longitudinally during follow-up.

Neurocognitive decline was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed using standardized continuous scores on individual neurocognitive tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean sample age was 64 years (SD, 9), 62% were women, and the prevalence of neurocognitive impairment at any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment was 6.3% by CERAD and 15.4% by SIS definitions. Adjusted odds ratios for neurocognitive impairment for participants with versus without PCSK9 LOF variants were 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58–2.13) using the CERAD battery and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.61–1.30) using the SIS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment. Standardized average differences in individual neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ment scores over the 5.6-year (range, 0.1–9.1) study period ranged between 0.07 (95% CI, −0.06 to 0.20) and −0.07 (95% CI, −0.18 to 0.05) among participants with versus without PCSK9 LOF variants. Patterns of neurocognitive decline were similar between participants with and without PCSK9 LOF variants (all <i>P</i>>0.10). Odds ratios for neurocognitive impairment per 20 mg/dL low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decrements were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96–1.08) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95–1.02) for the CERAD and SIS definitions of impairment, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results suggest that lifelong exposure to low PCSK9 levels and cumulative exposure to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are not associated with neurocognitive effects in blacks.</p></sec>

Aortic Wall Inflammation Predicts Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Expansion, Rupture, and Need for Surgical Repair

The primary end point was the composite of aneurysm rupture or repair.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Participants (85% male, 73.1±7.2 years) had a baseline aneurysm diameter of 49.6±7.7 mm, and USPIO enhancement was identified in 146 (42.7%) participants, absent in 191 (55.8%), and indeterminant in 5 (1.5%). During follow-up (1005±280 days), 17 (5.0%) abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures, 126 (36.8%) abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, and 48 (14.0%) deaths occurred. Compared with those without uptake, patients with USPIO enhancement have increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of aneurysm expansion (3.1±2.5 versus 2.5±2.4 mm/year, <i>P</i>=0.0424), although this was not independent of current smoking habit (<i>P</i>=0.1993). Patients with USPIO enhancement had higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of aneurysm rupture or repair (47.3% versus 35.6%; 95% confidence intervals, 1.1–22.2; <i>P</i>=0.0308). This finding was similar for each component of rupture (6.8% versus 3.7%, <i>P</i>=0.1857) or repair (41.8% versus 32.5%, <i>P</i>=0.0782). USPIO enhancement was associated with reduced event-free survival for aneurysm rupture or repair (<i>P</i>=0.0275), all-cause mortality (<i>P</i>=0.0635), and aneurysm-related mortality (<i>P</i>=0.0590).

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies in middle-age and older (masters) athletes with atherosclerotic risk factors for coronary artery disease report higher coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores compared with sedentary individuals. Few studies have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed the prevalence of coronary artery disease in masters athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assess</span></strong>ed 152 masters athletes 54.4±8.5 years of age (70% male) and 92 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s of similar age, sex, and low Framingham 10-year coronary artery disease risk scores with an echocardiogram, exercise stress test, computerized tomographic coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and a 24-hour Holter. Athletes had participated in endurance exercise for an average of 31±12.6 years. The majority (77%) were runners, with a median of 13 marathon runs per athlete.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Most athletes (60%) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (63%) had a normal CAC score. Male athletes had a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques of any luminal irregularity (44.3% versus 22.2%; <i>P</i>=0.009) compared with sedentary males, and only male athletes showed a CAC ≥300 Agatston units (11.3%) and a luminal stenosis ≥50% (7.5%).

Male athletes are more likely to have a CAC score >300 Agatston units or coronary plaques compared with sedentary males with a similar risk profile. The significance of these observations is uncertain, but the predominantly calcific morphology of the plaques in athletes indicates potentially different pathophysiological mechanisms for plaque formation in athletic versus sedentary men. Coronary plaques are more abundant in athletes, whereas their stable nature could mitigate the risk of plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

Left Ventricular Assist Device Malfunctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reports of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) malfunction have focused on pump thrombosis. However, the device consists of the pump, driveline, and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Prospectively collected data were reviewed for all LVAD device malfunctions (DMs) occurring in rotary LVADs implanted at a single center between April 2004 and May 2016. Durable LVADs included 108 Heartmate II (HM II) and 105 HeartWare VAD (HVAD). DM data were categorized according to device type and into categories related to the component that failed: (1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ler, (2) peripheral components, and (3) implantable blood pump or its integral electric driveline. Pump-related events were analyzed as pump-specific (suspected or confirmed thrombosis) or nonpump-specific (driveline failure). DM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s were reported as events per 1000 patient-days, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses. Cumulative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of malfunction were examined for the main components of each type of LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Types of DM included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ler failure (30%), battery failure (19%), or patient cable failure (14%), whereas only 13% were because of pump failure. DMs were more common in the HM II device (3.73 per 1000 patient-days versus 3.06 per 1000 patient-days for the HVAD, <i>P</i><0.01). A higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of pump-specific malfunctions was discovered in those implanted with an HM II versus an HVAD (0.55 versus 0.39, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01) and peripheral malfunctions (2.32 versus 1.78 for the HM II and HVAD, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01); no difference occurred in the incidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ler DM between the 2 LVADs. Patients with HVAD were 90% free of a pump-specific malfunction at 3 years compared with 56% for the HM II (log-rank <i>P</i><0.003).

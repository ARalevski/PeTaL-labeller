Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor ductility owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made ductile by specific dilute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued plastic straining during deformation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for ductility as a function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium. The mechanistic theory can quickly screen for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> compositions favoring conditions for high ductility and may help in the development of high-formability magnesium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p>Metals that are active catalysts for methane (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–melting temperature metals (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> catalysts for pyrolysis of methane into hydrogen and carbon. All <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> catalysts previously used for this reaction have been deactivated by carbon deposition. In the molten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> system, the insoluble carbon floats to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> achieved 95% methane conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure hydrogen without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products. Calculations show that the active metals in the molten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s are atomically dispersed and negatively charged. There is a correlation between the amount of charge on the atoms and their catalytic activity.</p>

Precipitation strengthening of aluminum alloys by room-temperature cyclic plasticity
<p>High-strength aluminum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s are important for lightweighting vehicles and are extensively used in aircraft and, increasingly, in automobiles. The highest-strength aluminum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s require a series of high-temperature “bakes” (120° to 200°C) to form a high number density of nanoparticles by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-state precipitation. We found that a controlled, room-temperature cyclic deformation is sufficient to continuously inject vacancies into the material and to mediate the dynamic precipitation of a very fine (1- to 2-nanometer) distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e clusters. This results in better material strength and elongation properties relative to traditional thermal treatments, despite a much shorter processing time. The microstructures formed are much more uniform than those characteristic of traditional thermal treatments and do not exhibit precipitate-free zones. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s are therefore likely to be more resistant to damage.</p>

Multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles and superb mechanical behaviors of complex alloys
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> design based on single–principal-element systems has approached its limit for performance enhancements. A substantial increase in strength up to gigapascal levels typically causes the premature failure of materials with reduced ductility. Here, we report a strategy to break this trade-off by controllably introducing high-density ductile multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles (MCINPs) in complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> systems. Distinct from the intermetallic-induced embrittlement under conventional wisdom, such MCINP-strengthened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s exhibit superior strengths of 1.5 gigapascals and ductility as high as 50% in tension at ambient temperature. The plastic instability, a major concern for high-strength materials, can be completely eliminated by generating a distinctive multistage work-hardening behavior, resulting from pronounced dislocation activities and deformation-induced microbands. This MCINP strategy offers a paradigm to develop next-generation materials for structural applications.</p>

Chemically reversible isomerization of inorganic clusters
<p>Structural transformations in molecules and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s have generally been studied in isolation, whereas intermediate systems have eluded characterization. We show that a pair of cadmium sulfide (CdS) cluster isomers provides an advantageous experimental platform to study isomerization in well-defined, atomically precise systems. The clusters coherently interconvert over an ~1–electron volt energy barrier with a 140–milli–electron volt shift in their excitonic energy gaps. There is a diffusionless, displacive reconfiguration of the inorganic core (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> transformation) with first order (isomerization-like) transformation kinetics. Driven by a distortion of the ligand-binding motifs, the presence of hydroxyl species changes the surface energy via physisorption, which determines “phase” stability in this system. This reaction possesses essential characteristics of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> transformations and molecular isomerizations and bridges these disparate length scales.</p>

Segregation-induced ordered superstructures at general grain boundaries in a nickel-bismuth alloy
<p>The properties of materials change, sometimes catastrophically, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>ing elements and impurities accumulate preferentially at grain boundaries. Studies of bicrystals show that regular atomic patterns often arise as a result of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e segregation at high-symmetry boundaries, but it is not known whether superstructures exist at general grain boundaries in polycrystals. In bismuth-doped polycrystalline nickel, we found that ordered, segregation-induced grain boundary superstructures occur at randomly selected general grain boundaries, and that these reconstructions are driven by the orientation of the terminating grain surfaces rather than by lattice matching between grains. This discovery shows that adsorbate-induced superstructures are not limited to special grain boundaries but may exist at a variety of general grain boundaries, and hence they can affect the performance of polycrystalline engineering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin coating either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supersatur</span></strong>ated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Multivalent counterions diminish the lubricity of polyelectrolyte brushes
<p>Polyelectrolyte brushes provide wear protection and lubrication in many technical, medical, physiological, and biological applications. Wear resistance and low friction are attributed to counterion osmotic pressure and the hydration layer surrounding the charged polymer segments. However, the presence of multivalent counterions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion can strongly affect the interchain interactions and structural properties of brush layers. We evaluated the lubrication properties of polystyrene sulfonate brush layers sliding against each other in aqueous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions containing increasing concentrations of counterions. The presence of multivalent ions (Y<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>), even at minute concentrations, markedly increases the friction forces between brush layers owing to electrostatic bridging and brush collapse. Our results suggest that the lubricating properties of polyelectrolyte brushes in multivalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion are hindered relative to those in monovalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion.</p>

Reducing the stochasticity of crystal nucleation to enable subnanosecond memory writing
<p>Operation speed is a key challenge in phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory. Commercialized PCRAM products are limited by the tens of nanoseconds writing speed, originating from the stochastic crystal nucleation during the crystallization of amorphous germanium antimony telluride<i> </i>(Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>). Here, we demonstrate an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>ing strategy to speed up the crystallization kinetics. The scandium antimony telluride (Sc<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) compound that we designed allows a writing speed of only 700 picoseconds without preprogramming in a large conventional PCRAM device. This ultrafast crystallization stems from the reduced stochasticity of nucleation through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize crystal precursors in the amorphous state. Controlling nucleation through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> design paves the way for the development of cache-type PCRAM technology to boost the working efficiency of computing systems.</p>

Interaction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>ification fronts with objects leads to different outcomes, from total rejection of the objects to their complete engulfment. We imaged the freezing of emulsions in five dimensions (space, time, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e concentration) with confocal microscopy.

Coherently aligned nanoparticles within a biogenic single crystal: A biological prestressing strategy
<p>In contrast to synthetic materials, materials produced by organisms are formed in ambient conditions and with a limited selection of elements. Nevertheless, living organisms reveal elegant strategies for achieving specific functions, ranging from skeletal support to mastication, from sensors and defensive tools to optical function. Using state-of-the-art characterization techniques, we present a biostrategy for strengthening and toughening the otherwise brittle calcite optical lenses found in the brittlestar <i>Ophiocoma wendtii</i>. This intriguing process uses coherent nanoprecipitates to induce compressive stresses on the host matrix, functionally resembling the Guinier–Preston zones known in classical metallurgy. We believe that these calcitic nanoparticles, being rich in magnesium, segregate during or just after transformation from amorphous to crystalline phase, similarly to segregation behavior from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supersatur</span></strong>ated quenched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>.</p>

Structure-property relationships from universal signatures of plasticity in disordered solids

Disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s also flow, but without obvious structural defects. We link structure to plasticity in disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s via a microscopic structural quantity, “softness,” designed by machine learning to be maximally predictive of rearrangements. Experimental results and computations enabled us to measure the spatial correlations and strain response of softness, as well as two measures of plasticity: the size of rearrangements and the yield strain. All four quantities maintained remarkable commonality in their values for disordered packings of objects ranging from atoms to grains, spanning seven orders of magnitude in diameter and 13 orders of magnitude in elastic modulus. These commonalities link the spatial correlations and strain response of softness to rearrangement size and yield strain, respectively.</p>

Angular momentum–induced delays in solid-state photoemission enhanced by intra-atomic interactions
<p>Attosecond time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that photoemission from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s is not yet fully understood. The relative emission delays between four photoemission channels measured for the van der Waals crystal tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) can only be explained by accounting for both propagation and intra-atomic delays. The intra-atomic delay depends on the angular momentum of the initial localized state and is determined by intra-atomic interactions. For the studied case of WSe<sub>2</sub>, the photoemission events are time ordered with rising initial-state angular momentum. Including intra-atomic electron-electron interaction and angular momentum of the initial localized state yields excellent agreement between theory and experiment. This has required a revision of existing models for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-state photoemission, and thus, attosecond time-resolved photoemission from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s provides important benchmarks for improved future photoemission models.</p>

Ultrafine jagged platinum nanowires enable ultrahigh mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction

Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (γ) of xylem sap plays a key role in stabilizing air-water interfaces at the pits between water- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low water potentials. We studied seasonal changes in xylem sap γ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine timberline. We analyzed their vulnerability to drought-induced embolism using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions of different γ and estimated the potential effect of seasonal changes in γ on hydraulic vulnerability. In both species, xylem sap γ showed distinct seasonal courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions with low γ caused higher vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism. The water potential at 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was −3.35 and −3.86 MPa at γ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup> but −2.11 and −2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa seasonal variation in 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity. The results revealed pronounced effects of changes in xylem sap γ on the hydraulic safety of trees in situ. These effects also are relevant in vulnerability analyses, where the use of standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions with high γ overestimates hydraulic safety. Thus, γ should be considered carefully in hydraulic studies.</p>

Unique function of a chemosensory protein in the proboscis of two <i>Helicoverpa</i> species
<p>Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are soluble proteins found only in arthropods. Some of them fill the lumen of chemosensilla and are believed to play a role similar to that of odorant-binding proteins in the detection of semiochemicals. Other members of the CSP family have been reported to perform different functions, from delivery of pheromones to development. This report is focused on a member (CSP4) of the family that is highly and almost exclusively present in the proboscis of two sibling noctuid species, <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> and <i>H. assulta</i>. We expressed the protein in bacteria and measured binding to terpenoids and related compounds. Using specific antibodies, we found that when the moths suck on a sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion, CSP4 is partly extruded from the proboscis. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion of protein can also fill a hydrophobic tube of same length and diameter as the proboscis by capillary action. On this basis, we suggest that CSP4 acts as a wetting agent to reduce the surface tension of aqueous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions and consequently the pressure involved in sucking.</p>

Shear properties of Earth’s inner core constrained by a detection of <i>J</i> waves in global correlation wavefield
<p>Seismic <i>J</i> waves, shear waves that traverse Earth’s inner core, provide direct constraints on the inner core’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>ity and shear properties. However, these waves have been elusive in the direct seismic wavefield because of their small amplitudes. We devised a new method to detect <i>J</i> waves in the earthquake coda correlation wavefield. They manifest through the similarity with other compressional core-sensitive signals. The inner core is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>, but relatively soft, with shear-wave speeds and shear moduli of 3.42 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 149.0 ± 1.6 gigapascals (GPa) near the inner core boundary and 3.58 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 167.4 ± 1.6 GPa in Earth’s center. The values are 2.5% lower than the widely used Preliminary Earth Reference Model. This provides new constraints on the dynamical interpretation of Earth’s inner core.</p>

Observation of Dicke cooperativity in magnetic interactions
<p>The interaction of <i>N</i> two-level atoms with a single-mode light field is an extensively studied many-body problem in quantum optics, first analyzed by Dicke in the context of superradiance. A characteristic of such systems is the cooperative enhancement of the coupling strength by a factor of [Formula]. In this study, we extended this cooperatively enhanced coupling to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-state system, demonstrating that it also occurs in a magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> in the form of matter-matter interaction. Specifically, the exchange interaction of <i>N</i> paramagnetic erbium(III) (Er<sup>3+</sup>) spins with an iron(III) (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) magnon field in erbium orthoferrite (ErFeO<sub>3</sub>) exhibits a vacuum Rabi splitting whose magnitude is proportional to [Formula].

A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory

Our device consists of a semiconductor spin qubit strongly coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. The spin qubit enables a single 63-picosecond gate photon to switch a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 photons before the internal state of the device resets. Our results show that semiconductor nanophotonic devices can produce strong and controlled photon-photon interactions that could enable high-bandwidth photonic quantum information processing.</p>

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction structures of covalent organic frameworks

The high quality of the crystals allowed collection of single-crystal x-ray diffraction data of up to 0.83-angstrom re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion, leading to unambiguous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion and precise anisotropic refinement.

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins
<p>Prion-like RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP43 and FUS are largely soluble in the nucleus but form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> pathological aggregates when mislocalized to the cytoplasm. What keeps these proteins soluble in the nucleus and promotes aggregation in the cytoplasm is still unknown. We report here that RNA critically regulates the phase behavior of prion-like RBPs. Low RNA/protein ratios promote phase separation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive phase separation and the formation of cytotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.</p>

A nonconjugated radical polymer glass with high electrical conductivity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-state conducting polymers usually have highly conjugated macromolecular backbones and require intentional doping in order to achieve high electrical conductivities. Conversely, single-component, charge-neutral macromolecules could be synthetically simpler and have improved processibility and ambient stability. We show that poly(4-glycidyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl), a nonconjugated radical polymer with a subambient glass transition temperature, underwent rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-state charge transfer reactions and had an electrical conductivity of up to 28 siemens per meter over channel lengths up to 0.6 micrometers. The charge transport through the radical polymer film was enabled with thermal annealing at 80°C, which allowed for the formation of a percolating network of open-shell sites in electronic communication with one another. The electrical conductivity was not enhanced by intentional doping, and thin films of this material showed high optical transparency.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Structural basis of membrane disruption and cellular toxicity by α-synuclein oligomers

In support of these conclusions, mutations that target the region that promotes strong membrane interactions by α-synuclein oligomers suppressed their toxicity in neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons.</p>

High dislocation density–induced large ductility in deformed and partitioned steels
<p>A wide variety of industrial applications require materials with high strength and ductility. Unfortunately, the strategies for increasing material strength, such as processing to create line defects (dislocations), tend to decrease ductility. We developed a strategy to circumvent this in inexpensive, medium manganese steel. Cold rolling followed by low-temperature tempering developed steel with metastable austenite grains embedded in a highly dislocated martensite matrix. This deformed and partitioned (D and P) process produced dislocation hardening but retained high ductility, both through the glide of intensive mobile dislocations and by allowing us to control martensitic transformation. The D and P strategy should apply to any other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> with deformation-induced martensitic transformation and provides a pathway for the development of high-strength, high-ductility materials.</p>

Biological control of aragonite formation in stony corals
<p>Little is known about how stony corals build their calcareous skeletons.

Using a combination of ultrahigh-re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion three<i>-</i>dimensional imaging and two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that mineral deposition is biologically driven. Randomly arranged, amorphous nanoparticles are initially deposited in microenvironments enriched in organic material; they then aggregate and form ordered aragonitic structures through crystal growth by particle attachment. Our NMR results are consistent with heterogeneous nucleation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> mineral phase driven by coral acid-rich proteins. Such a mechanism suggests that stony corals may be able to sustain calcification even under lower pH conditions that do not favor the inorganic precipitation of aragonite.</p>

Thermal processing of diblock copolymer melts mimics metallurgy
<p>Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments conducted with compositionally asymmetric low molar mass poly(isoprene)-<i>b</i>-poly(lactide) diblock copolymers reveal an extraordinary thermal history dependence.

Whereas direct cooling leads to the formation of documented morphologies, rapidly quenched samples that are then heated from low temperature form the hexagonal C14 and cubic C15 Laves phases commonly found in metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s.

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional metals become harder with decreasing grain sizes, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship. However, this relationship fails and softening occurs at some grain sizes in the nanometer regime for some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s. In this study, we discovered that plastic deformation mechanism of extremely fine nanograined metals and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring grain boundary (GB) stability. The electrodeposited nanograined nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for grain sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB stabilization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh hardness is achieved in the nanograined samples with a plastic deformation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations. Grain boundary stability provides an alternative dimension, in addition to grain size, for producing novel nanograined metals with extraordinary properties.</p>

Bone-like crack resistance in hierarchical metastable nanolaminate steels

We show here that when steel microstructures are hierarchical and laminated, similar to the substructure of bone, superior crack resistance can be realized. Our results reveal that tuning the interface structure, distribution, and phase stability to simultaneously activate multiple micromechanisms that resist crack propagation is key for the observed leap in mechanical response.

Adaption of Roots to Nitrogen Deficiency Revealed by 3D Quantification and Proteomic Analysis
<p>Rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is an important oil crop worldwide. However, severe inhibition of rapeseed production often occurs in the field due to nitrogen (N) deficiency. The root system is the main organ to acquire N for plant growth, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying rapeseed root adaptions to N deficiency. Here, dynamic changes in root architectural traits of N-deficient rapeseed plants were evaluated by 3D in situ quantification. Root proteome responses to N deficiency were analyzed by the tandem mass tag-based proteomics method, and related proteins were characterized further. Under N deficiency, rapeseed roots become longer, with denser cells in the meristematic zone and larger cells in the elongation zone of root tips, and also become softer with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>ity. A total of 171 and 755 differentially expressed proteins were identified in short- and long-term N-deficient roots, respectively. The abundance of proteins involved in cell wall organization or biogenesis was highly enhanced, but most identified peroxidases were reduced in the N-deficient roots. Notably, peroxidase activities also were decreased, which might promote root elongation while lowering the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>ity of N-deficient roots. These results were consistent with the cell wall components measured in the N-deficient roots. Further functional analysis using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants demonstrated that the two root-related differentially expressed proteins contribute to the enhanced root growth under N deficiency conditions. These results provide insights into the global changes of rapeseed root responses to N deficiency and may facilitate the development of rapeseed cultivars with high N use efficiency through root-based genetic improvements.</p>

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with elongation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial gradients for elongation rate, osmotic pressure, cell wall thickness, and wall mechanical compliances and coupled these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the polysaccharide composition, mobility, hydration, and intermolecular interactions of the inflorescence cell wall using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering. Force-extension curves revealed a gradient, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-scattering curves showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal gradient in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

Bumblebees are not deterred by ecologically relevant concentrations of nectar toxins
<p>Bees visit flowers to collect nectar and pollen that contain nutrients and simultaneously facilitate plant sexual reproduction. Paradoxically, nectar produced to attract pollinators often contains deterrent or toxic plant compounds associated with herbivore defence. The functional significance of these nectar toxins is not fully understood, but they may have a negative impact on pollinator behaviour and health, and, ultimately, plant pollination. This study investigates whether a generalist bumblebee, <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, can detect naturally occurring concentrations of nectar toxins. Using paired-choice experiments, we identified deterrence thresholds for five compounds found in the nectar of bee-pollinated plants: quinine, caffeine, nicotine, amygdalin and grayanotoxin. The deterrence threshold was determined when bumblebees significantly preferred a sucrose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion over a sucrose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion containing the compound. Bumblebees had the lowest deterrence threshold for the alkaloid quinine (0.01 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>); all other compounds had higher deterrence thresholds, above the natural concentration range in floral nectar. Our data, combined with previous work using honeybees, suggest that generalist bee species have poor acuity for the detection of nectar toxins. The fact that bees do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of these compounds likely indicates that it is difficult for them to learn to associate floral traits with the presence of toxins, thus maintaining this trait in plant populations.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium ion current induced by muscarinic stimulation (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by application of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrations (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions and distinct current–voltage relationship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclusion of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfusion with K<sup>+</sup>-free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activation, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervation.</p>

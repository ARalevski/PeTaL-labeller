Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s could enable engineering of powerful new cellular behaviors. Rational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> design would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> architectures. In this study, we show that engineered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to generate regulatory cascades, binary logic gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally designed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene. Because CHOMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s can perform complex functions yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> engineering for biotechnological applications.</p>

Structures of the CRISPR genome integration complex
<p>CRISPR-Cas systems depend on the Cas1-Cas2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ase to capture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate short foreign DNA fragments into the CRISPR locus, enabling adaptation to new viruses. We present crystal structures of Cas1-Cas2 bound to both donor and target DNA in intermediate and product <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation complexes, as well as a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the full CRISPR locus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation complex, including the accessory protein IHF (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation host factor). The structures show unexpectedly that indirect sequence recognition dictates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation site selection by favoring deformation of the repeat and the flanking sequences. IHF binding bends the DNA sharply, bringing an upstream recognition motif into contact with Cas1 to increase both the specificity and efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation. These results explain how the Cas1-Cas2 CRISPR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ase recognizes a sequence-dependent DNA structure to ensure site-selective CRISPR array expansion during the initial step of bacterial adaptive immunity.</p>

Complex signal processing in synthetic gene circuits using cooperative regulatory assemblies
<p>Eukaryotic genes are regulated by multivalent transcription factor complexes. Through cooperative self-assembly, these complexes perform nonlinear regulatory operations involved in cellular decision-making and signal processing. In this study, we apply this design principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative assemblies can program nonlinear gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying the strength and number of assembly subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and nonlinear regulatory responses for single- and multi-input <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s. We demonstrate that assemblies can be adjusted to control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> dynamics. We harness this capability to engineer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s that perform dynamic filtering, enabling frequency-dependent decoding in cell populations. Programmable cooperative assembly provides a versatile way to tune the nonlinearity of network connections, markedly expanding the engineerable behaviors available to synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.</p>

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated nonreciprocal optical components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagation direction, are key for routing signals in photonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated quantum optical circulator operated by a single atom. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interaction between the atom and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the atom controls the operation direction of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level. This enables, for example, photon number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.</p>

Identification of Putative Substrates of SEC2, a Chloroplast Inner Envelope Translocase
<p>Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into chloroplasts. Many imported proteins are further targeted to the thylakoid membrane and lumen by the SEC1, TAT, or SRP/ALB3 translocases. Others are targeted to the inner chloroplast envelope membrane by undescribed translocases. Recently, a second SEC system (SEC2) consisting of SCY2, SECE2, and SECA2 was found in the chloroplast envelope. Null mutants of <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exhibit a severe embryo-lethal phenotype. To investigate the function of the SEC2 system in plants, we used inducible RNA interference to knock down <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis. Seedlings cultured with inducer were chlorotic with aberrant chloroplasts and undeveloped thylakoids, indicating an essential role for SCY2 in chloroplast biogenesis beyond embryo development. In <i>SCY2</i> down-regulated seedlings, several thylakoid membrane proteins, including SCY1, ALB3, and TATC, and inner envelope membrane proteins, including TIC40, TIC110, and FTSH12, were reduced substantially, suggesting that they may be SEC2 substrates. Additional insight was achieved by the in vitro reconstitution of protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation into chloroplast membranes. The results show that SCY1 and ALB3 target directly to the thylakoid membrane and are likely independent of SEC2. FTSH12 was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated into the envelope membrane in a coupled import-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation reaction that was impaired by the SECA inhibitor sodium azide. The stromal intermediate of TIC40 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated into the envelope in a reaction that was largely inhibited when antibodies against epitope-tagged SCY2 or SECE2 were applied. These data demonstrate that the SEC2 translocase likely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ates a subset of inner envelope membrane proteins, such as FTSH12 and TIC40.</p>

Inverse-designed metastructures that solve equations
<p>Metastructures hold the potential to bring a new twist to the field of spatial-domain optical analog computing: migrating from free-space and bulky systems into conceptually wavelength-sized elements. We introduce a metamaterial platform capable of solving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>al equations using monochromatic electromagnetic fields. For an arbitrary wave as the input function to an equation associated with a prescribed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>al operator, the solution of such an equation is generated as a complex-valued output electromagnetic field. Our approach is experimentally demonstrated at microwave frequencies through solving a generic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>al equation and using a set of waveguides as the input and output to the designed metastructures. By exploiting subwavelength-scale light-matter interactions in a metamaterial platform, our wave-based, material-based analog computer may provide a route to achieve chip-scale, fast, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>able computing elements.</p>

Satisfaction, function and repair integrity after arthroscopic <i>versus</i> mini-open rotator cuff repair
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advances in arthroscopic techniques for rotator cuff repair have   made the mini-open approach less popular.

Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), open tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional open vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The open vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, open tunnel EVH, and open vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for open tunnel EVH compared with open vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for open tunnel EVH, and 6% for open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed tunnel EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Integration of protein phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation data sets to outline lung cancer signaling networks
<p>Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) have typically been studied independently, yet many proteins are modified by more than one PTM type, and cell signaling pathways somehow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate this information. We coupled immunoprecipitation using PTM-specific antibodies with tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry to simultaneously examine phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation in 45 lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung tissue and to cell lines treated with anticancer drugs. This simultaneous, large-scale, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative analysis of these PTMs using a cluster-filtered network (CFN) approach revealed that cell signaling pathways were outlined by clustering patterns in PTMs. We used the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method to identify PTM clusters and then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated each with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to elucidate functional cell signaling pathways. The CFN identified known and previously unknown cell signaling pathways in lung cancer cells that were not present in normal lung epithelial tissue. In various proteins modified by more than one type of PTM, the incidence of those PTMs exhibited inverse relationships, suggesting that molecular exclusive “OR” gates determine a large number of signal transduction events. We also showed that the acetyltransferase EP300 appears to be a hub in the network of pathways involving different PTMs. In addition, the data shed light on the mechanism of action of geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor. Together, the findings reveal that cell signaling pathways mediated by acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation regulate the cytoskeleton, membrane traffic, and RNA binding protein–mediated control of gene expression.</p>

Cellular checkpoint control using programmable sequential logic

The performance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s with up to three latches and four sensors, including a gated D latch, closely match predictions made by using nonlinear dynamics.

Genomic signals of selection predict climate-driven population declines in a migratory bird

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience. As explosions pattern the sky, the visual system must capture information about the time-varying positions, colors, and contrasts of myriad spots of light. This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s that map visual space. To generate this retinotopy (visual mapping), neurons must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved? The molecules that regulate neuronal differentiation have been described in detail, as have the cues that allow differentiated neurons to reach and choose their synaptic partners (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, the mechanisms that coordinate neuronal specification with the development of retinotopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> wiring have remained elusive. On page 886 of this issue, Fernandes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that in the visual system of flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), photoreceptors use glial cells as intermediaries to communicate with their neural targets to generate retinotopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.</p>

History of winning remodels thalamo-PFC circuit to reinforce social dominance
<p>Mental strength and history of winning play an important role in the determination of social dominance.

Working in mice, we identified a dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) neural population showing “effort”-related firing during moment-to-moment competition in the dominance tube test. Activation or inhibition of the dmPFC induces instant winning or losing, respectively. In vivo optogenetic-based long-term potentiation and depression experiments establish that the mediodorsal thalamic input to the dmPFC mediates long-lasting changes in the social dominance status that are affected by history of winning. The same neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> also underlies transfer of dominance between different social contests.

Branch-specific plasticity of a bifunctional dopamine circuit encodes protein hunger

A Price to Pay for Adult Neurogenesis
<p>We tend to believe that plasticity is what makes brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s adaptable to continuous changes in environmental demands and that greater brain plasticity should result in a better ability to cope with the surrounding world. To adapt to everyday life, animals explore, learn, and remember, and these tasks make use of various cortical structures, including the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus, part of the hippocampus, is a remarkable structure in that it is one of two areas of the adult mammalian brain, including the human brain, that continue to generate new neurons throughout postnatal life (<i>1</i>). It is well established that adult-born neurons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate into preexisting neuronal networks and participate in information processing (<i>2</i>). Much evidence accumulated over the past decade supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis itself is a type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> plasticity required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory recall. The work by Akers <i>et al.</i> on page 598 of this issue (<i>3</i>) now shows that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may also promote forgetting.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Guard Cell Salicylic Acid Signaling Is Integrated into Abscisic Acid Signaling via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-Dependent Pathway
<p>The phenolic hormone salicylic acid (SA) induces stomatal closure. It has been suggested that SA signaling is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in guard cells, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation mechanism remains unclear. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent protein kinase Open Stomata1 (OST1) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are key for ABA-induced activation of the slow-type anion channel SLAC1 and stomatal closure. Here, we show that SA-induced stomatal closure and SA activation of slow-type anion channel are impaired in the CPK disruption mutant <i>cpk3-2 cpk6-1</i> but not in the OST1 disruption mutant <i>ost1-3</i>. We also found that the key phosphorylation sites of SLAC1 in ABA signaling, serine-59 and serine-120, also are important for SA signaling. Chemiluminescence-based detection of superoxide anion revealed that SA did not require CPK3 and CPK6 for the induction of reactive oxygen species production. Taken together, our results suggest that SA activates peroxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species signal that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated into Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-dependent ABA signaling branch but not the OST1-dependent signaling branch in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) guard cells.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are dispersed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short dispersed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Integrated Consensus Map of Cultivated Peanut and Wild Relatives Reveals Structures of the A and B Genomes of <i>Arachis</i> and Divergence of the Legume Genomes
<p>The complex, tetraploid genome structure of peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) has obstructed advances in genetics and genomics in the species. The aim of this study is to understand the genome structure of <i>Arachis</i> by developing a high-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated consensus map. Three recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses between the A genome diploid species, <i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis stenosperma</i>; the B genome diploid species, <i>Arachis ipaënsis</i> and <i>Arachis magna</i>; and between the AB genome tetraploids, <i>A. hypogaea</i> and an artificial amphidiploid (<i>A. ipaënsis</i> × <i>A. duranensis</i>)<sup>4×</sup>, were used to construct genetic linkage maps: 10 linkage groups (LGs) of 544 cM with 597 loci for the A genome; 10 LGs of 461 cM with 798 loci for the B genome; and 20 LGs of 1442 cM with 1469 loci for the AB genome. The resultant maps plus 13 published maps were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated into a consensus map covering 2651 cM with 3693 marker loci which was anchored to 20 consensus LGs corresponding to the A and B genomes. The comparative genomics with genome sequences of <i>Cajanus cajan</i>, <i>Glycine max</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and <i>Medicago truncatula</i> revealed that the <i>Arachis</i> genome has segmented synteny relationship to the other legumes. The comparative maps in legumes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated tetraploid consensus maps, and genome-specific diploid maps will increase the genetic and genomic understanding of <i>Arachis</i> and should facilitate molecular breeding.</p>

Prognostic Implications of Magnetic Resonance–Derived Quantification in Asymptomatic Patients With Organic Mitral Regurgitation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate method for the quantitative assessment of organic mitral regurgitation (OMR). The aim of the present study was to compare the discriminative power of MRI quantification and the recommended Doppler echocardiography (ECHO)–derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative approach to identify asymptomatic patients with OMR and adverse outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population consisted of 258 asymptomatic patients (63±14 years, 60% men) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (>60%) and chronic moderate and severe OMR (flail 25%, prolapse 75%) defined by using the ECHO-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative approach. All patients underwent MRI to quantify regurgitant volume (RV) of OMR by subtracting the aortic forward flow volume from the total left ventricular stroke volume. Severe OMR was defined as RV≥60 mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean ECHO-derived RV was on average 17.1 mL larger than the MRI-derived RV (<i>P</i><0.05). Concordant grading of OMR severity with both techniques was observed in 197 (76%) individuals with 62 (31%) patients having severe OMR (MRI SEV-ECHO SEV) and 135 (69%) patients having moderate OMR (MRI MOD-ECHO MOD). The remaining 61 (24%) individuals had discordant findings (MRI SEV-ECHO MOD or MRI MOD-ECHO SEV) between the 2 techniques. The majority of these differences in OMR classification were observed in patients with late systolic or multiple jets (both κ<0.2). Patients with eccentric jets showed moderate agreement (κ=0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.64). In contrast, a very good agreement (κ=0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.98) was observed in a combination of holosystolic, central, and single jet. During a median follow-up of 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.5–6.0 years), 38 (15%) patients died and 106 (41%) either died or developed indication for mitral valve surgery. In separate Cox regression analyses, the MRI-derived left ventricular end-systolic volume index, RV, and OMR category (severe versus moderate), and the ECHO-derived OMR category were independent predictors of all-cause mortality (all <i>P</i><0.05). The MRI-derived RV showed the largest area under the curve to predict mortality (0.72) or its combination with the development of indication for mitral valve surgery (0.83).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The findings of the present study suggest that the MRI-derived assessment of OMR can better identify patients with severe OMR and adverse outcome than ECHO-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative approach warranting close follow-up and perhaps, early mitral valve surgery.</p></sec>

Integrated Noninvasive Physiological Assessment of Coronary Circulatory Function and Impact on Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is suggested that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation of maximal myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), termed coronary flow capacity, allows for comprehensive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. Because management decisions are predicated on clinical risk, we sought to determine the independent and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated value of maximal MBF and CFR for predicting cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MBF and CFR were quantified in 4029 consecutive patients (median age 66 years, 50.5% women) referred for rest/stress myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography scans from January 2006 to December 2013. The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality. Maximal MBF <1.8 mL·g<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup> and CFR<2 were considered impaired. Four patient groups were identified based on the concordant or discordant impairment of maximal MBF or CFR. Association of maximal MBF and CFR with cardiovascular death was assessed using Cox and Poisson regression analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 392 (9.7%) cardiovascular deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 5.6 years. CFR was a stronger predictor of cardiovascular mortality than maximal MBF beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors, left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial scar and ischemia, rate-pressure product, type of radiotracer or stress agent used, and revascularization after scan (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38–2.31; <i>P</i><0.001 per unit decrease in CFR after adjustment for maximal MBF and clinical covariates; and adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.84–1.27; <i>P</i>=0.8 per unit decrease in maximal MBF after adjustment for CFR and clinical covariates). In univariable analyses, patients with concordant impairment of CFR and maximal MBF had high cardiovascular mortality of 3.3% (95% CI, 2.9–3.7) per year. Patients with impaired CFR but preserved maximal MBF had an intermediate cardiovascular mortality of 1.7% (95% CI, 1.3–2.1) per year. These patients were predominantly women (70%). Patients with preserved CFR but impaired maximal MBF had low cardiovascular mortality of 0.9% (95% CI, 0.6–1.6) per year. Patients with concordantly preserved CFR and maximal MBF had the lowest cardiovascular mortality of 0.4% (95 CI, 0.3–0.6) per year. In multivariable analysis, the cardiovascular mortality risk gradient across the 4 concordant or discordant categories was independently driven by impaired CFR irrespective of impairment in maximal MBF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CFR is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular mortality than maximal MBF. Concordant and discordant categories based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ating CFR and maximal MBF identify unique prognostic phenotypes of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.</p></sec>

A central neural circuit for itch sensation
<p>Although itch sensation is an important protective mechanism for animals, chronic itch remains a challenging clinical problem. Itch processing has been studied extensively at the spinal level. However, how itch information is transmitted to the brain and what central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s underlie the itch-induced scratching behavior remain largely unknown. We found that the spinoparabrachial pathway was activated during itch processing and that optogenetic suppression of this pathway impaired itch-induced scratching behaviors. Itch-mediating spinal neurons, which express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, are disynaptically connected to the parabrachial nucleus via glutamatergic spinal projection neurons. Blockade of synaptic output of glutamatergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus suppressed pruritogen-induced scratching behavior. Thus, our studies reveal a central neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that is critical for itch signal processing.</p>

Iodide management in formamidinium-lead-halide–based perovskite layers for efficient solar cells
<p>The formation of a dense and uniform thin layer on the substrates is crucial for the fabrication of high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) containing formamidinium with multiple cations and mixed halide anions. The concentration of defect states, which reduce a cell’s performance by decreasing the open-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> voltage and short-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> current density, needs to be as low as possible. We show that the introduction of additional iodide ions into the organic cation solution, which are used to form the perovskite layers through an intramolecular exchanging process, decreases the concentration of deep-level defects. The defect-engineered thin perovskite layers enable the fabrication of PSCs with a certified power conversion efficiency of 22.1% in small cells and 19.7% in 1-square-centimeter cells.</p>

Engrams and circuits crucial for systems consolidation of a memory
<p>Episodic memories initially require rapid synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus for their formation and are gradually consolidated in neocortical networks for permanent storage. However, the engrams and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s that support neocortical memory consolidation have thus far been unknown. We found that neocortical prefrontal memory engram cells, which are critical for remote contextual fear memory, were rapidly generated during initial learning through inputs from both the hippocampal–entorhinal cortex network and the basolateral amygdala. After their generation, the prefrontal engram cells, with support from hippocampal memory engram cells, became functionally mature with time. Whereas hippocampal engram cells gradually became silent with time, engram cells in the basolateral amygdala, which were necessary for fear memory, were maintained. Our data provide new insights into the functional reorganization of engrams and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s underlying systems consolidation of memory.</p>

Breathing to inspire and arouse
<p>Breathing is one of the perpetual rhythms of life that is often taken for granted, its apparent simplicity belying the complex neural machinery involved. This behavior is more complicated than just producing inspiration, as breathing is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated with many other motor functions such as vocalization, orofacial motor behaviors, emotional expression (laughing and crying), and locomotion (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). In addition, cognition can strongly influence breathing. Conscious breathing during yoga, meditation, or psychotherapy can modulate emotion, arousal state, or stress (<i>3</i>). Therefore, understanding the links between breathing behavior, brain arousal state, and higher-order brain activity is of great interest. On page 1411 of this issue, Yackle <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) identify an apparently specialized, molecularly identifiable, small subset of ∼350 neurons in the mouse brain that forms a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> for transmitting information about respiratory activity to other central nervous system neurons, specifically with a group of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem, that influences arousal state (see the figure). This finding provides new insight into how the motor act of breathing can influence higher-order brain functions.</p>

Demonstration of an ac Josephson junction laser

An ultimate demonstration of coherence is lasing.

A dc voltage bias applied across the junction provides a source of microwave photons, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>’s nonlinearity allows for efficient down-conversion of higher-order Josephson frequencies to the cavity’s fundamental mode. The simple fabrication and operation allows for easy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation with a range of quantum devices, allowing for efficient on-chip generation of coherent microwave photons at low temperatures.</p>

Cryo-EM structures and atomic model of the HIV-1 strand transfer complex intasome

The intasome, a higher-order nucleoprotein complex composed of viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ase (IN) and the ends of linear vDNA, mediates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation. Productive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation into host chromatin results in the formation of the strand transfer complex (STC) containing catalytically joined vDNA and tDNA.

We used a soluble IN fusion protein to facilitate structural studies, through which we present a high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the core tetrameric HIV-1 STC and a higher-order form that adopts carboxyl-terminal domain rearrangements. The distinct STC structures highlight how HIV-1 can use the common retroviral intasome core architecture to accommodate different IN domain modules for assembly.</p>

β-cell–mimetic designer cells provide closed-loop glycemic control
<p>Chronically deregulated blood-glucose concentrations in diabetes mellitus result from a loss of pancreatic insulin-producing β cells (type 1 diabetes, T1D) or from impaired insulin sensitivity of body cells and glucose-stimulated insulin release (type 2 diabetes, T2D). Here, we show that therapeutically applicable β-cell–mimetic designer cells can be established by minimal engineering of human cells. We achieved glucose responsiveness by a synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that couples glycolysis-mediated calcium entry to an excitation-transcription system controlling therapeutic transgene expression. Implanted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>-carrying cells corrected insulin deficiency and self-sufficiently abolished persistent hyperglycemia in T1D mice. Similarly, glucose-inducible glucagon-like peptide 1 transcription improved endogenous glucose-stimulated insulin release and glucose tolerance in T2D mice. These systems may enable a combination of diagnosis and treatment for diabetes mellitus therapy.</p>

A disynaptic feedback network activated by experience promotes the integration of new granule cells
<p>Experience shapes the development and connectivity of adult-born granule cells (GCs) through mechanisms that are poorly understood. We examined the remodeling of dentate gyrus micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s in mice in an enriched environment (EE). Short exposure to EE during early development of new GCs accelerated their functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation. This effect was mimicked by in vivo chemogenetic activation of a limited population of mature GCs. Slice recordings showed that mature GCs recruit parvalbumin γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing interneurons (PV-INs) that feed back onto developing GCs. Accordingly, chemogenetic stimulation of PV-INs or direct depolarization of developing GCs accelerated GC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation, whereas inactivation of PV-INs prevented the effects of EE. Our results reveal a mechanism for dynamic remodeling in which experience activates dentate networks that “prime” young GCs through a disynaptic feedback loop mediated by PV-INs.</p>

Extensive migration of young neurons into the infant human frontal lobe
<p>The first few months after birth, when a child begins to interact with the environment, are critical to human brain development. The human frontal lobe is important for social behavior and executive function; it has increased in size and complexity relative to other species, but the processes that have contributed to this expansion are unknown. Our studies of postmortem infant human brains revealed a collection of neurons that migrate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate widely into the frontal lobe during infancy. Chains of young neurons move tangentially close to the walls of the lateral ventricles and along blood vessels. These cells then individually disperse long distances to reach cortical tissue, where they differentiate and contribute to inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s. Late-arriving interneurons could contribute to developmental plasticity, and the disruption of their postnatal migration or differentiation may underlie neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple myelin sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid nerve conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of myelinated nerves (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ations using an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Split-TALE: A TALE-Based Two-Component System for Synthetic Biology Applications in Planta
<p>Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are bacterial Type-III effector proteins from phytopathogenic <i>Xanthomonas</i> species that act as transcription factors in plants. The modular DNA-binding domain of TALEs can be reprogrammed to target nearly any DNA sequence. Here, we designed and optimized a two-component AND-gate system for synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s in plants based on TALEs. In this system, named split-TALE (sTALE), the TALE DNA binding domain and the transcription activation domain are separated and each fused to protein interacting domains. Physical interaction of interacting domains leads to TALE-reconstitution and can be monitored by reporter gene induction. This setup was used for optimization of the sTALE scaffolds, which result in an AND-gate system with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. We also provide a toolkit of ready-to-use vectors and single modules compatible with Golden Gate cloning and MoClo syntax. In addition to its implementation in synthetic regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s, the sTALE system allows the analysis of protein-protein interactions in planta.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, plants experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate these environmental cues to maintain plant growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato plants, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation enzyme, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic enzyme, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that plants have evolved for growth and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion sites created by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-genome sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet oxygen, as visualized using the singlet oxygen-specific probe singlet oxygen sensor green. The production of singlet oxygen was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular accumulation of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity. Cell death began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet oxygen were observed. The accumulation of other reactive oxygen species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell death. In addition, both the singlet oxygen scavenger His and the lipoxygenase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet oxygen accumulation and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet oxygen production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the accumulation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet oxygen plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

Multi-Omics Driven Assembly and Annotation of the Sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) Genome
<p>Indian sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) is an important tropical evergreen tree known for its fragrant heartwood-derived essential oil and its valuable carving wood. Here, we applied an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approach to assemble and annotate the Indian sandalwood genome. Our genome sequencing resulted in the establishment of a draft map of the smallest genome for any woody tree species to date (221 Mb). The genome annotation predicted 38,119 protein-coding genes and 27.42% repetitive DNA elements. In-depth proteome analysis revealed the identities of 72,325 unique peptides, which confirmed 10,076 of the predicted genes. The addition of transcriptomic and proteogenomic approaches resulted in the identification of 53 novel proteins and 34 gene-correction events that were missed by genomic approaches. Proteogenomic analysis also helped in reassigning 1,348 potential noncoding RNAs as bona fide protein-coding messenger RNAs. Gene expression patterns at the RNA and protein levels indicated that peptide sequencing was useful in capturing proteins encoded by nuclear and organellar genomes alike. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic evidence provided an unbiased approach toward the identification of proteins encoded by organellar genomes. Such proteins are often missed in transcriptome data sets due to the enrichment of only messenger RNAs that contain poly(A) tails. Overall, the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated omic approaches enhanced the quality of the assembly and annotation of this nonmodel plant genome. The availability of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data will enhance genomics-assisted breeding, germplasm characterization, and conservation of sandalwood trees.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation into chromosomes. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its rigidity and structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale forces that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose surfaces in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold screw conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose surfaces but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold screw conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic surface compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving forces on the structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate into biological systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic biology. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant biology. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

ChloroKB: A Web Application for the Integration of Knowledge Related to Chloroplast Metabolic Network
<p>Higher plants, as autotrophic organisms, are effective sources of molecules. They hold great promise for metabolic engineering, but the behavior of plant metabolism at the network level is still incompletely described. Although structural models (stoichiometry matrices) and pathway databases are extremely useful, they cannot describe the complexity of the metabolic context, and new tools are required to visually represent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated biocurated knowledge for use by both humans and computers. Here, we describe ChloroKB, a Web application (<ext-link>http://chlorokb.fr/</ext-link>) for visual exploration and analysis of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) metabolic network in the chloroplast and related cellular pathways. The network was manually reconstructed through extensive biocuration to provide transparent traceability of experimental data. Proteins and metabolites were placed in their biological context (spatial distribution within cells, connectivity in the network, participation in supramolecular complexes, and regulatory interactions) using CellDesigner software. The network contains 1,147 reviewed proteins (559 localized exclusively in plastids, 68 in at least one additional compartment, and 520 outside the plastid), 122 proteins awaiting biochemical/genetic characterization, and 228 proteins for which genes have not yet been identified. The visual presentation is intuitive and browsing is fluid, providing instant access to the graphical representation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated processes and to a wealth of refined qualitative and quantitative data. ChloroKB will be a significant support for structural and quantitative kinetic modeling, for biological reasoning, when comparing novel data with established knowledge, for computer analyses, and for educational purposes. ChloroKB will be enhanced by continuous updates following contributions from plant researchers.</p>

Octopaminergic modulation of the visual flight speed regulator of <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that flies' sensitivity to large-field optic flow is increased by the release of octopamine during flight. This increase in gain presumably enhances visually mediated behaviors such as the active regulation of forward speed, a process that involves the comparison of a vision-based estimate of velocity with an internal set point. To determine where in the neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> this comparison is made, we selectively silenced the octopamine neurons in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i>, and examined the effect on vision-based velocity regulation in free-flying flies. We found that flies with inactivated octopamine neurons accelerated more slowly in response to visual motion than control flies, but maintained nearly the same baseline flight speed. Our results are parsimonious with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> architecture in which the internal control signal is injected into the visual motion pathway upstream of the interneuron network that estimates groundspeed.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Increased elongation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es are hallmarks of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular signaling components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e utilizes diverse components of the light sensing and signal transduction network to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant organs. Alternatively, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing may be confined to specific tissues or organs, which would require a systemic signal that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show organ-specific transcriptome responses to elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and organ-interdependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing and signaling. Seedling roots can sense and respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responses require both local and systemic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin signal. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in the hypocotyl.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. To maintain activity across a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Phytochromes function as thermosensors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Plants are responsive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, and some species can distinguish differences of 1°C. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, warmer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e accelerates flowering and increases elongation growth (thermomorphogenesis). However, the mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e perception are largely unknown. We describe a major thermosensory role for the phytochromes (red light receptors) during the night. Phytochrome null plants display a constitutive warm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e response, and consistent with this, we show in this background that the warm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e transcriptome becomes derepressed at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. We found that phytochrome B (phyB) directly associates with the promoters of key target genes in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent manner. The rate of phyB inactivation is proportional to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in the dark, enabling phytochromes to function as thermal timers that integrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e information over the course of the night.</p>

Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e air samples from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with samples from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sensors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement proved to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field samples (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable sensors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the sensors’ methods enable accurate ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

Measurement of a superconducting qubit with a microwave photon counter
<p>Fast, high-fidelity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement is a key ingredient for quantum error correction. Conventional approaches to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement of superconducting qubits, involving linear amplification of a microwave probe tone followed by heterodyne detection at room <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, do not scale well to large system sizes. We introduce an approach to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement based on a microwave photon counter demonstrating raw single-shot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement fidelity of 92%. Moreover, the intrinsic damping of the photon counter is used to extract the energy released by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement process, allowing repeated high-fidelity quantum nondemolition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements. Our scheme provides access to the classical outcome of projective quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement at the millikelvin stage and could form the basis for a scalable quantum-to-classical interface.</p>

Quantum correlations from a room-temperature optomechanical cavity

The TRPM2 channel is a hypothalamic heat sensor that limits fever and can drive hypothermia
<p>Body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e homeostasis is critical for survival and requires precise regulation by the nervous system. The hypothalamus serves as the principal thermostat that detects and regulates internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. We demonstrate that the ion channel TRPM2 [of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family] is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in a subpopulation of hypothalamic neurons. TRPM2 limits the fever response and may detect increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es to prevent overheating. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation and inhibition of hypothalamic TRPM2-expressing neurons in vivo decreased and increased body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, respectively. Such manipulation may allow analysis of the beneficial effects of altered body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on diverse disease states. Identification of a functional role for TRP channels in monitoring internal body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e should promote further analysis of molecular mechanisms governing thermoregulation and foster the genetic dissection of hypothalamic circuits involved with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e homeostasis.</p>

Integrating Omics and Alternative Splicing Reveals Insights into Grape Response to High Temperature
<p>Heat stress is one of the primary abiotic stresses that limit crop production. Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a cultivated fruit with high economic value throughout the world, with its growth and development often influenced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong></span></strong>e. Alternative splicing (AS) is a widespread phenomenon increasing transcriptome and proteome diversity. We conducted high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e treatments (35°C, 40°C, and 45°C) on grapevines and assessed transcriptomic (especially AS) and proteomic changes in leaves. We found that nearly 70% of the genes were alternatively spliced under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong></span></strong>e. Intron retention (IR), exon skipping, and alternative donor/acceptor sites were markedly induced under different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong></span></strong>es. Among all differential AS events, IR was the most abundant up- and down-regulated event. Moreover, the occurrence frequency of IR events at 40°C and 45°C was far higher than at 35°C. These results indicated that AS, especially IR, is an important posttranscriptional regulatory event during grape leaf responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong></span></strong>e. Proteomic analysis showed that protein levels of the RNA-binding proteins SR45, SR30, and SR34 and the nuclear ribonucleic protein U1A gradually rose as ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e increased, which revealed a reason why AS events occurred more frequently under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong></span></strong>e. After integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, we found that heat shock proteins and some important transcription factors such as MULTIPROTEIN BRIDGING FACTOR1c and HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A2 were involved mainly in heat tolerance in grape through up-regulating transcriptional (especially modulated by AS) and translational levels. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for grape leaf responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong></span></strong>e at simultaneous transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. High ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong></span></strong>es irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in barley.</p>

An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used different definitions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for misinterpretation of the   results.

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of elevated ozone (1.4× ambient) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e elevation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Trans-generational plasticity in physiological thermal tolerance is modulated by maternal pre-reproductive environment in the polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i>
<p>Maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its effect on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i> to investigate the influence of maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30°C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24°C and then exposed to 18 or 30°C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24°C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother–offspring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30°C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother–offspring environments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-generational effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on physiological performance characterised by a high context dependency, and are discussed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (2°C) below and above their habitat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)

Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

Temporal and spatial patterns of internal and external stem CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in a sub-Mediterranean oak
<p>To accurately estimate stem respiration (<i>R</i><sub>S</sub>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of both carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) efflux to the atmosphere (<i>E</i><sub>A</sub>) and internal CO<sub>2</sub> flux through xylem (<i>F</i><sub>T</sub>) are needed because xylem sap transports respired CO<sub>2</sub> upward. However, reports of seasonal dynamics of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> are scarce and no studies exist in Mediterranean species under drought stress conditions. Internal and external CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes at three stem heights, together with radial stem growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, sap flow and shoot water potential, were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in <i>Quercus pyrenaica</i> Willd. in four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement campaigns during one growing season. Substantial daytime depressions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-normalized <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> were observed throughout the experiment, including prior to budburst, indicating that diel hysteresis between stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> cannot be uniquely ascribed to diversion of CO<sub>2</sub> in the transpiration stream. Low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] (<0.5%) resulted in low contributions of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> throughout the growing season, and <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> was mainly explained by <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> (>90%). Internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] was found to vary vertically along the stems. Seasonality in resistance to radial CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion was related to shoot water potential. The low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] and <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> observed in our study may result from the downregulation of xylem respiration in response to a legacy of coppicing as well as high radial diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> through cambium, phloem and bark tissues, which was related to low water content of stems. Long-term studies analyzing temporal and spatial variation in internal and external CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and their interactions are needed to mechanistically understand and model respiration of woody tissues.</p>

Enhanced thermal stability of nanograined metals below a critical grain size
<p>The limitation of nanograined materials is their strong tendency to coarsen at elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. As grain size decreases into the nanoscale, grain coarsening occurs at much lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es, as low as ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es for some metals. We discovered that nanometer-sized grains in pure copper and nickel produced from plastic deformation at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es exhibit notable thermal stability below a critical grain size. The instability <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e rises substantially at smaller grain sizes, and the nanograins remain stable even above the recrystallization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es of coarse grains. The inherent thermal stability of nanograins originates from an autonomous grain boundary evolution to low-energy states due to activation of partial dislocations in plastic deformation.</p>

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. Photosynthesis transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed. Reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net photosynthesis, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e by applying different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Photoperiod and temperature responses of bud swelling and bud burst in four temperate forest tree species
<p>Spring phenology of temperate forest trees is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The release from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod. We investigated the response of early spring phenology to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod at different stages of dormancy release in cuttings from four temperate tree species in controlled environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud swelling and bud growth in <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L., <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Mattuschka) Liebl. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy release, the onset and duration of the bud swelling prior to bud burst are driven by concurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod, while the maximum growth rate is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e dependent only, except for <i>Fagus</i>, where long photoperiods also increased bud growth rates. Similarly, the later bud burst was controlled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod (in the photoperiod sensitive species <i>Fagus, Quercus</i> and <i>Picea</i>). We conclude that photoperiod is involved in the release of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud burst in trees that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud swelling period that precedes and defines later phenological stages such as canopy greening in conventional phenological works. It is the early bud growth resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of tree phenology at a large scale. Classic spring phenology events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here.</p>

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of carbohydrate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es on the carbohydrate concentrations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large increases in the sorbitol concentration of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responses. When trees were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling accumulation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol accumulation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling accumulation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling accumulation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e effects more closely, we compared the carbohydrate concentrations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol concentration in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es when sufficient chilling accumulated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total carbohydrate concentration of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of accumulated chilling. Instead, as chilling accumulated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that carbohydrates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol accumulation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total carbohydrate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responses on carbohydrate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

The histone demethylase KDM6B regulates temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sex determination is a notable model of phenotypic plasticity. In many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> (<i>T. scripta</i>), the individual’s sex is determined by the ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e during egg incubation. In this study, we show that the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase KDM6B exhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sexually dimorphic expression in early <i>T. scripta</i> embryos before the gonad is distinct. Knockdown of <i>Kdm6b</i> at 26°C (a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e at which all offspring develop into males) triggers male-to-female sex reversal in >80% of surviving embryos. KDM6B directly promotes the transcription of the male sex-determining gene <i>Dmrt1</i> by eliminating the trimethylation of H3K27 near its promoter. Additionally, overexpression of <i>Dmrt1</i> is sufficient to rescue the sex reversal induced by disruption of <i>Kdm6b</i>. This study establishes causality and a direct genetic link between epigenetic mechanisms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sex determination in a turtle species.</p>

Spatial entanglement patterns and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in Bose-Einstein condensates
<p>Many-particle entanglement is a fundamental concept of quantum physics that still presents conceptual challenges. Although nonclassical states of atomic ensembles were used to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement precision in quantum metrology, the notion of entanglement in these systems was debated because the correlations among the indistinguishable atoms were witnessed by collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements only.

We observe entanglement that is strong enough for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering: We can predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement outcomes for noncommuting observables in one spatial region on the basis of corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements in another region with an inferred uncertainty product below the Heisenberg uncertainty bound.

<p>In common with many strongly correlated electron systems, intermediate valence compounds are believed to display a crossover from a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regime of incoherently fluctuating local moments to a low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regime of coherent hybridized bands. We show that inelastic neutron scattering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of CePd<sub>3</sub> provides a benchmark for ab initio calculations based on dynamical mean field theory. The magnetic response is strongly momentum dependent thanks to the formation of coherent f-electron bands at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, with an amplitude that is strongly enhanced by local particle-hole interactions. The agreement between experiment and theory shows that we have a robust first-principles understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e dependence of f-electron coherence.</p>

Phytochrome B integrates light and temperature signals in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, but its sensors are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the phytochrome B (phyB) photoreceptor participates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e perception through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent reversion from the active Pfr state to the inactive Pr state. Increased rates of thermal reversion upon exposing <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings to warm environments reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool of phyB and the size of the associated nuclear bodies, even in daylight. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals. We therefore propose that in addition to its photoreceptor functions, phyB is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in plants.</p>

Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> across the Mesophyll-Bundle Sheath Cell Interface in a C<sub>4</sub> Plant with Genetically Reduced PEP Carboxylase Activity
<p>Phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), localized to the cytosol of the mesophyll cell, catalyzes the first carboxylation step of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used RNA interference to target the cytosolic photosynthetic PEPC isoform in <i>Setaria viridis</i> and isolated independent transformants with very low PEPC activities. These plants required high ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for growth, consistent with the essential role of PEPC in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The combination of estimating direct CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by the bundle sheath using gas-exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements and modeling C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis with low PEPC activity allowed the calculation of bundle sheath conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>) in the progeny of these plants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements made at a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es suggested no or negligible effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> depending on the technique used to calculate <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. Anatomical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements revealed that plants with reduced PEPC activity had reduced cell wall thickness and increased plasmodesmata (PD) density at the mesophyll-bundle sheath (M-BS) cell interface, whereas we observed little difference in these parameters at the mesophyll-mesophyll cell interface. The increased PD density at the M-BS interface was largely driven by an increase in the number of PD pit fields (cluster of PDs) rather than an increase in PD per pit field or the size of pit fields. The correlation of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> with bundle sheath surface area per leaf area and PD area per M-BS area showed that these parameters and cell wall thickness are important determinants of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. It is intriguing to speculate that PD development is responsive to changes in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic flux.</p>

Genome Wide Analysis of Fatty Acid Desaturation and Its Response to Temperature
<p>Plants modify the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of their membrane and storage lipids in order to adapt to changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. In developing seeds, this response is largely controlled by the activities of the microsomal ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acid desaturases, FAD2 and FAD3. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regulation of desaturation has been studied at the molecular and biochemical levels, the genetic control of this trait is poorly understood. Here, we have characterized the response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed lipids to variation in ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and found that heat inhibits both ω-6 and ω-3 desaturation in phosphatidylcholine, leading to a proportional change in triacylglycerol composition. Analysis of the 19 parental accessions of the multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population showed that significant natural variation exists in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation. A combination of quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using the MAGIC population suggests that ω-6 desaturation is largely controlled by cis-acting sequence variants in the <i>FAD2</i> 5′ untranslated region intron that determine the expression level of the gene. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation is controlled by a separate QTL on chromosome 2. The identity of this locus is unknown, but genome-wide association studies identified potentially causal sequence variants within ∼40 genes in an ∼450-kb region of the QTL.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

Heart rate as a predictor of metabolic rate in heterothermic bats
<p>While heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) has been used as an indicator of energy expenditure, quantitative data showing the relationship between these variables are only available for normothermic animals. To determine whether <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> also predicts oxygen consumption ([Formula]) during torpor, we simultaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed [Formula], <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and subcutaneous body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (<i>T</i><sub>sub</sub>) of a hibernator, Gould's long-eared bats (<i>Nyctophilus gouldi</i>, 9 g, <i>N</i>=18), at ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>) between 0 and 25°C. At rest, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of normothermic resting bats was negatively correlated with <i>T</i><sub>a</sub>, with maximum <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of 803 beats min<sup>−1</sup> (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>=5°C). During torpor, the relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>a</sub> was curvilinear, and at low <i>T</i><sub>sub</sub> (~6°C), <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> fell to a minimum average of 8 beats min<sup>−1</sup>. The minimum average values for both [Formula] and <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in torpor reported here were among the lowest recorded for bats. The relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and [Formula] was significant for both resting (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.64, <i>P</i><0.001) and torpid bats (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.84, <i>P</i><0.001), with no overlap between the two states. These variables were also significantly correlated (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.44, <i>P</i><0.001) for entire torpor bouts. Moreover, estimates of [Formula] from <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> did not differ significantly from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed values during the different physiological states. Our study is the first to investigate the accuracy of <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> as a predictor of [Formula] during torpor and indicates the reliability of this method as a potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of energy expenditure in the field. Nevertheless, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> should only be used to predict [Formula] within the range of activities for which robust correlations have been established.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

The validity and reproducibility of cross table radiographs compared with CT scans for the measurement of anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty

There were 17 men and 12 women. Their   mean age was 43 years (26 to 65). Seven patients underwent a bilateral   procedure. Thus, 36 THAs were included in the study. Lateral radiographs   and CT scans were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later. The anteversion of the acetabular component was   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed using the method described by Woo and Morrey and the ischiolateral   method described by Pulos et al and these were compared with the   results obtained from CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean anteversion was 18.35° (3° to 38°) using Woo and Morrey’s   method, 51.45° (30° to 85°) using the ischiolateral method and 21.22°   (2° to 48°) using CT scans. The Pearson correlation coefficient   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method. There was a linear correlation between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements   using the ischiolateral method and those using CT scans.

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults

We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of diastolic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for diastolic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-based cut points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal diastolic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal diastolic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign.

High-temperature pairing in a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas
<p>The nature of the normal phase of strongly correlated fermionic systems is an outstanding question in quantum many-body physics. We used spatially resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e pairing energy of fermions across a wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es and interaction strengths in a two-dimensional gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We observed many-body pairing at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es far above the critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e for superfluidity. In the strongly interacting regime, the pairing energy in the normal phase considerably exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing in this regime is driven by many-body correlations, rather than two-body physics. Our findings show that pairing correlations in strongly interacting two-dimensional fermionic systems are remarkably robust against thermal fluctuations.</p>

Atomic-layered Au clusters on α-MoC as catalysts for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction

Water was activated over α-MoC at 303 kelvin, whereas carbon monoxide adsorbed on adjacent Au sites was apt to react with surface hydroxyl groups formed from water splitting, leading to a high WGS activity at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es.</p>

Low-temperature activation of methane on the IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface
<p>Methane undergoes highly facile C–H bond cleavage on the stoichiometric IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface. From <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-programmed reaction spectroscopy experiments, we found that methane molecularly adsorbed as a strongly bound σ complex on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) and that a large fraction of the adsorbed complexes underwent C–H bond cleavage at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es as low as 150 kelvin (K). The initial dissociation probability of methane on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) decreased from 80 to 20% with increasing surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e from 175 to 300 K. We estimate that the activation energy for methane C–H bond cleavage is 9.5 kilojoule per mole (kJ/mol) lower than the binding energy of the adsorbed precursor on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110), and equal to a value of ~28.5 kJ/mol. Low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e activation may avoid unwanted side reactions in the development of catalytic processes to selectively convert methane to value-added products.</p>

Quantifying Wheat Sensitivities to Environmental Constraints to Dissect Genotype × Environment Interactions in the Field
<p>Yield is subject to strong genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions in the field, especially under abiotic constraints such as soil water deficit (drought [D]) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong></span></strong>e (heat [H]). Since environmental conditions show strong fluctuations during the whole crop cycle, geneticists usually do not consider environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es as quantitative variables but rather as factors in multienvironment analyses. Based on 11 experiments in a field platform with contrasting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and soil water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to drought and heat constraints in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components. G × E interactions were separated into their underlying components, constitutive genotypic effect (G), G × D, G × H, and G × H × D, and were analyzed for two genotypes, highlighting contrasting responses to heat and drought constraints. We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviors of two strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated previously with yield components. This analysis confirmed the constitutive effect of the chromosome 1B QTL and explained the G × E interaction of the chromosome 3B QTL by a benefit of one allele when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e rises. In addition to the method itself, which can be applied to other data sets and populations, this study will support the cloning of a major yield QTL on chromosome 3B that is highly dependent on environmental conditions and for which the climatic interaction is now quantified.</p>

In this study, we investigated the acclimation process of the alga to a colder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (25°C). A long-term cell growth experiment revealed an extensive remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus in the first 250 h of acclimation, which was followed by cell growth to an even higher density than the control (grown at 42°C) cell density. Once the cells were shifted to the lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, the proteins of the light-harvesting antenna were greatly down-regulated and the phycobilisome composition was altered. The amount of PSI and PSII subunits was also decreased, but the chlorophyll to photosystems ratio remained unchanged. The 25°C cells possessed a less efficient photon-to-oxygen conversion rate and require a 2.5 times higher light intensity to reach maximum photosynthetic efficiency. With respect to chlorophyll, however, the photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate of the 25°C culture was 2 times higher than the control. Quantitative proteomics revealed that acclimation requires, besides remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus, also adjustment of the machinery for protein folding, degradation, and homeostasis. In summary, these remodeling processes tuned photosynthesis according to the demands placed on the system and revealed the capability of <i>C. merolae</i> to grow under a broad range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity
<p>During winter, trees have to cope with harsh conditions, including extreme freeze-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell damage and was based on in situ monitoring of xylem (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermocoupl</span></strong>es) and surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es (infrared imaging), ultrasonic emissions, and dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct freezing patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the base, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and base, and (3) from the base toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from their base toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of freezing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon freezing, were both related to minimum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit and soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. These complex patterns, emphasizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter tree physiology.</p>

A new approach for measuring temperature inside turtle eggs
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> A non-lethal method for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e inside turtle eggs shows that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es inside and outside the egg are the same, and that air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e differs in a moisture-dependent manner.</p>

Increased homeothermy during reproduction in a basal placental mammal
<p>Homeothermic endothermy, the maintenance of a high and stable body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) using heat produced by elevated metabolism, is energetically expensive. There is increasing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict homeothermy, allowed <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest-phase <i>T</i><sub>b</sub>. The high level of homeothermy observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that homeothermy allows for greater energetic output during reproduction (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing metabolic rates over a range of ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es in both reproductive and non-reproductive greater hedgehog tenrecs (<i>Setifer setosus</i>), a physiologically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest metabolic rates and highest levels of <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During pregnancy and lactation, there was an increase in metabolism and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at ~25°C. However, whereas increases in resting metabolism were substantial below 20°C (up to 150% higher during reproduction), daytime rest-phase ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, <i>S. setosus</i> provide an example for how relatively low-cost increases in homeothermy could have led to substantial increases in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young. The mechanisms necessary for increases in thermogenesis during reproduction would have further benefited the development of homeothermy in mammals.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite sensitive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

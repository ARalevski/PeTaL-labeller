Prediction of the pre-morbid 3D anatomy of the proximal humerus based on statistical shape modelling
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Restoring the pre-morbid anatomy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humerus is a   goal of anatomical shoulder arthroplasty, but reliance is placed   on the surgeon’s experience and on anatomical estimations. The purpose   of this study was to present a novel method, ‘Statistical Shape   Modelling’, which accurately predicts the pre-morbid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humeral anatomy   and calculates the 3D geometric parameters needed to restore normal   anatomy in patients with severe degenerative osteoarthritis or a   fracture of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humerus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>From a database of 57 humeral CT scans 3D humeral reconstructions   were manually created. The reconstructions were used to construct   a statistical shape model (SSM), which was then tested on a second   set of 52 scans. For each humerus in the second set, 3D reconstructions   of four diaphyseal segments of varying lengths were created. These   reconstructions were chosen to mimic severe osteoarthritis, a fracture   of the surgical neck of the humerus and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humeral fracture   with diaphyseal extension. The SSM was then applied to the diaphyseal   segments to see how well it predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al morphology, using   the actual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humeral morphology for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the errors   of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature   and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were   2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm),   0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the   metaphysis excluded, mimicking a fracture of the surgical neck,   the errors of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius   of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the   humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3   mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm    (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports a novel, computerised method that accurately   predicts the pre-morbid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humeral anatomy even in challenging   situations. This information can be used in the surgical planning   and operative reconstruction of patients with severe degenerative   osteoarthritis or with a fracture of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humerus.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:927–33.</p></sec>

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases Affect UV-B-Induced Stomatal Closure via Controlling NO in Guard Cells
<p>Ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation induces the activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1) and its targets MPK3 and MPK6, but whether they participate in UV-B guard cell signaling is not clear. Here, evidence shows that UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is antagonistically regulated by MKP1 and MPK6 via modulating hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in guard cells. The <i>mkp1</i> mutant was hypersensitive to UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and NO production in guard cells but not to UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, suggesting that MKP1 negatively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e via inhibiting NO generation in guard cells. Moreover, MPK3 and MPK6 were activated by UV-B in leaves of the wild type and hyperactivated in the <i>mkp1</i> mutant, but the UV-B-induced activation of MPK3 and MPK6 was largely inhibited in mutants for <i>ATRBOHD</i> and <i>ATRBOHF</i> but not in mutants for <i>NIA1</i> and <i>NIA2</i>. <i>mpk6</i> mutants showed defects of UV-B-induced NO production and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e but were normal in UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, while stomata of <i>mpk3</i> mutants responded to UV-B just like those of the wild type. The defect of UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in <i>mpk6</i> mutants was rescued by exogenous NO but not by exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, double mutant <i>mkp1</i>/<i>mpk6</i> and the single mutant <i>mpk6</i> showed the same responses to UV-B in terms of either stomatal movement or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO production. These data indicate that MPK6, but not MPK3, positively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e via acting downstream of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and upstream of NO, while MKP1 functions negatively in UV-B guard cell signaling via down-regulation of MPK6.</p>

Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a standard length intramedullary cemented stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical plates have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the survivorship   of short-stemmed endoprostheses and extra-cortical plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 37 patients who underwent limb salvage surgery   for a primary neoplasm of bone between 1998 and 2013. Endoprosthetic   replacement involved the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humerus in nine, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al   femur in nine, the distal femur in 13 and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al tibia in   six patients. There were 12 primary (32%) and 25 revision procedures (68%).   Implant survivorship was compared with matched controls. The amount   of bone that was resected was > 70% of its length and statistically   greater than the standard control group at each anatomical site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was seven years (one to 17). The mean length   of the stem was 33 mm (20 to 60) in the humerus and 79 mm (34 to   100) in the lower limb. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of the   implant according to anatomical site confirmed that there was no   statistically significant difference between the short-stemmed endoprostheses and   the standard stemmed controls at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humeral (p = 0.84),   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al femoral (p = 0.57), distal femoral (p = 0.21) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al   tibial (p = 0.61) sites.</p><p>In the short-stemmed group, no implants with extra-cortical plate   osseointegration suffered loosening at a mean of 8.5 years (range   2 to 16 years).

Hydrogen Sulfide Increases Production of NADPH Oxidase-Dependent Hydrogen Peroxide and Phospholipase D-Derived Phosphatidic Acid in Guard Cell Signaling<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important gaseous signaling molecule in plants that participates in stress responses and development. <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase 1, one of the enzymatic sources of H<sub>2</sub>S in plants, participates in abscisic acid-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e. We combined pharmacological and genetic approaches to elucidate the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and the interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and other second messengers of the guard cell signaling network, such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and phospholipase D (PLD)-derived phosphatidic acid in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Both NADPH oxidase isoforms, respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH)D and RBOHF, were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e. In vivo imaging using the cytosolic ratiometric fluorescent biosensor roGFP2-Orp1 revealed that H<sub>2</sub>S stimulates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in Arabidopsis guard cells. Additionally, we observed an interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and PLD activity in the regulation of reactive oxygen species production and stomatal movement. The PLDα1 and PLDδ isoforms were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e, and most of the H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production required the activity of PLDα1. Finally, we showed that H<sub>2</sub>S induced increases in the PLDδ-derived phosphatidic acid levels in guard cells. Our results revealed the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in the signaling network that controls stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e, and suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S regulates NADPH oxidase and PLD activity in guard cells.</p>

Drought-Enhanced Xylem Sap Sulfate Closes Stomata by Affecting ALMT12 and Guard Cell ABA Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Water limitation of plants causes stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e to prevent water loss by transpiration. For this purpose, progressing soil water deficit is communicated from roots to shoots. Abscisic acid (ABA) is the key signal in stress-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e, but ABA as an early xylem-delivered signal is still a matter of debate. In this study, poplar plants (<i>Populus × canescens</i>) were exposed to water stress to investigate xylem sap sulfate and ABA, stomatal conductance, and sulfate transporter (<i>SULTR</i>) expression. In addition, stomatal behavior and expression of ABA receptors, drought-responsive genes, transcription factors, and <i>NCED3</i> were studied after feeding sulfate and ABA to detached poplar leaves and epidermal peels of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The results show that increased xylem sap sulfate is achieved upon drought by reduced xylem unloading by PtaSULTR3;3a and PtaSULTR1;1, and by enhanced loading from parenchyma cells into the xylem via PtaALMT3b. Sulfate application caused stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in excised leaves and peeled epidermis. In the loss of sulfate-channel function mutant, At<i>almt12</i>, sulfate-triggered stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e was impaired. The QUAC1/ALMT12 anion channel heterologous expressed in oocytes was gated open by extracellular sulfate. Sulfate up-regulated the expression of <i>NCED3</i>, a key step of ABA synthesis, in guard cells. In conclusion, xylem-derived sulfate seems to be a chemical signal of drought that induces stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e via QUAC1/ALMT12 and/or guard cell ABA synthesis.</p>

Abscisic Acid-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species Are Modulated by Flavonols to Control Stomata Aperture
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells to close Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomata. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), we find that ABA-increased ROS is followed by stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and that both responses are blocked by inhibitors of ROS-producing respiratory burst oxidase enzymes. ABA-induced ROS sensor fluorescence accumulates in the nucleus, chloroplasts, and endomembranes. The accumulation of flavonol antioxidants in guard cells, but not surrounding pavement cells, was visualized by confocal microscopy using a flavonol-specific fluorescent dye. Decreased flavonols in guard cells in the <i>anthocyanin reduced</i> (<i>are</i>) mutant and elevated levels in the <i>anthocyanin without</i> (<i>aw</i>) mutant were quantified by confocal microscopy and in leaf extracts by mass spectrometry. Consistent with flavonols acting as antioxidants, higher levels of ROS were detected in guard cells of the tomato <i>are</i> mutant and lower levels were detected in <i>aw</i> both at homeostasis and after treatment with ABA. These results demonstrate the inverse relationship between flavonols and ROS. Guard cells of <i>are</i> show greater ABA-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e than the wild type, reduced light-dependent guard cell opening, and reduced water loss, with <i>aw</i> having opposite responses. Ethylene treatment of wild-type tomato plants increased flavonol accumulation in guard cells; however, no flavonol increases were observed in <i>Neverripe</i> (<i>Nr</i>), an ethylene receptor mutant. Consistent with lower levels of ROS due to elevated flavonols, ethylene treatments decreased ABA-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in the wild type, but not <i>Nr</i>, with ethylene responses attenuated in the <i>are</i> mutant. Together, these results are consistent with flavonols dampening the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and facilitating stomatal opening to modulate leaf gas exchange.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been measured previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clearanc</span></strong>e from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clearanc</span></strong>e from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clearanc</span></strong>e rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clearanc</span></strong>e rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

Impact of Left Atrial Appendage Closure During Cardiac Surgery on the Occurrence of Early Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke, and Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prophylactic exclusion of the left atrial appendage (LAA) is often performed during cardiac surgery ostensibly to reduce the risk of stroke. However, the clinical impact of LAA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in humans remains inconclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Of 10 633 adults who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and valve surgery between January 2000 and December 2005, 9792 patients with complete baseline characteristics, surgery procedure, and follow-up data were included in this analysis. A propensity score–matching analysis based on 28 pretreatment covariates was performed and 461 matching pairs were derived and analyzed to estimate the association of LAA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e with early postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) (atrial fibrillation ≤30 days of surgery), ischemic stroke, and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the propensity-matched cohort, the overall incidence of POAF was 53.9%.

Proximity biotinylation identifies a set of conformation-specific interactions between Merlin and cell junction proteins
<p>Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited, neoplastic disease associated with schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas and that is caused by inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene <i>NF2</i>. The <i>NF2</i> gene product, Merlin, has no intrinsic catalytic activity; its tumor suppressor function is mediated through the proteins with which it interacts. We used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>ity biotinylation followed by mass spectrometry and direct binding assays to identify proteins that associated with wild-type and various mutant forms of Merlin in immortalized Schwann cells. We defined a set of 52 proteins in close <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>ity to wild-type Merlin. Most of the Merlin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al proteins were components of cell junctional signaling complexes, suggesting that additional potential interaction partners may exist in adherens junctions, tight junctions, and focal adhesions. With mutant forms of Merlin that cannot bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) or that constitutively adopt a closed conformation, we confirmed a critical role for PIP<sub>2</sub> binding in Merlin function and identified a large cohort of proteins that specifically interacted with Merlin in the closed conformation. Among these proteins, we identified a previously unreported Merlin-binding protein, apoptosis-stimulated p53 protein 2 (ASPP2, also called Tp53bp2), that bound to closed-conformation Merlin predominately through the FERM domain. Our results demonstrate that Merlin is a component of cell junctional mechanosensing complexes and defines a specific set of proteins through which it acts.</p>

VAMP711 Is Required for Abscisic Acid-Mediated Inhibition of Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity
<p>Drought stress is a limiting environmental factor that affects plant growth and development. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in plant drought responses. Previous studies have indicated that ABA inhibits plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) activity, and the decrease in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity promotes stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e under drought stress, thereby reducing water loss. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we found that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), ABA induces an <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein, namely, VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 711 (VAMP711), to interact with the Arabidopsis PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases AHA1 and AHA2. The interaction occurs at their C-termini and inhibits PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. Deletion of <i>VAMP711</i> in Arabidopsis results in a higher PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and slower stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in response to ABA and drought treatments. In addition, overexpression of <i>VAMP711</i> partially rescues the drought-sensitive phenotype of <i>ost2-2D</i>, a mutation in <i>AHA1</i> resulting in a constitutive activated PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Our results demonstrate that VAMP711 is involved in regulating ABA-mediated inhibition of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in response to drought stress.</p>

Guard Cell Salicylic Acid Signaling Is Integrated into Abscisic Acid Signaling via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-Dependent Pathway
<p>The phenolic hormone salicylic acid (SA) induces stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e. It has been suggested that SA signaling is integrated with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in guard cells, but the integration mechanism remains unclear. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent protein kinase Open Stomata1 (OST1) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are key for ABA-induced activation of the slow-type anion channel SLAC1 and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e. Here, we show that SA-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and SA activation of slow-type anion channel are impaired in the CPK disruption mutant <i>cpk3-2 cpk6-1</i> but not in the OST1 disruption mutant <i>ost1-3</i>. We also found that the key phosphorylation sites of SLAC1 in ABA signaling, serine-59 and serine-120, also are important for SA signaling. Chemiluminescence-based detection of superoxide anion revealed that SA did not require CPK3 and CPK6 for the induction of reactive oxygen species production. Taken together, our results suggest that SA activates peroxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species signal that is integrated into Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-dependent ABA signaling branch but not the OST1-dependent signaling branch in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) guard cells.</p>

A Tonoplast-Associated Calcium-Signaling Module Dampens ABA Signaling during Stomatal Movement
<p>Stomatal movement, critical for photobiosynthesis, respiration, and stress responses, is regulated by many factors, among which abscisic acid (ABA) is critical. Early events of ABA signaling involve Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and an increase of cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>). Positive regulators of this process have been extensively studied, whereas negative regulators are obscure. ABA-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e involves K<sup>+</sup> flux and vacuolar convolution. How these processes are connected with Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not fully understood. We report that <i>pat10-1</i>, a null mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE10</i> (<i>PAT10</i>), is hypersensitive to ABA-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and vacuolar convolution. A similar phenotype was observed in <i>cbl2;cbl3</i>, the double mutant of CBL2 and CBL3, whose tonoplast association depends on PAT10. Functional loss of the PAT10-CBL2/CBL3 system resulted in enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> elevation. Promoting vacuolar K<sup>+</sup> accumulation by overexpressing <i>NHX2</i> suppressed ABA-hypersensitive stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and vacuolar convolution of the mutants, suggesting that PAT10-CBL2/CBL3 positively mediates vacuolar K<sup>+</sup> accumulation. We have identified CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) that mediate CBL2/CBL3 signaling during ABA-induced stomatal movement. Functional loss of the PAT10-CBL2/3-CIPK9/17 system in guard cells enhanced drought tolerance. We propose that the tonoplast CBL-CIPK complexes form a signaling module that negatively regulates ABA signaling during stomatal movement.</p>

Stomatal VPD Response: There Is More to the Story Than ABA
<p>Guard cells shrink and close stomatal pores when air humidity decreases (i.e. when the difference between the vapor pressures of leaf and atmosphere [VPD] increases). The role of abscisic acid (ABA) in VPD-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e has been studied using ABA-related mutants that respond to VPD in some studies and not in others. The importance of ABA biosynthesis in guard cells versus vasculature for whole-plant stomatal regulation is unclear as well. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines carrying mutations in different steps of ABA biosynthesis as well as pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <i>wilty</i> and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>flacca</i> ABA-deficient mutants had higher stomatal conductance compared with wild-type plants. To characterize the role of ABA production in different cells, we generated transgenic plants where ABA biosynthesis was rescued in guard cells or phloem companion cells of an ABA-deficient mutant. In both cases, the whole-plant stomatal conductance, stunted growth phenotype, and leaf ABA level were restored to wild-type values, pointing to the redundancy of ABA sources and to the effectiveness of leaf ABA transport. All ABA-deficient lines closed their stomata rapidly and extensively in response to high VPD, whereas plants with mutated protein kinase OST1 showed stunted VPD-induced responses. Another strongly ABA-insensitive mutant, defective in the six ABA PYR/RCAR receptors, responded to changes in VPD in both directions strongly and symmetrically, indicating that its VPD-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e could be passive hydraulic. We discuss that both the VPD-induced passive hydraulic stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and the stomatal VPD regulation of ABA-deficient mutants may be conditional on the initial pretreatment stomatal conductance.</p>

Stomatal Closure, Basal Leaf Embolism, and Shedding Protect the Hydraulic Integrity of Grape Stems
<p>The time scale of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and xylem cavitation during plant dehydration, as well as the fate of embolized organs, are under debate, largely due to methodological limitations in the evaluation of embolism. While some argue that complete stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e precedes the occurrence of embolism, others believe that the two are contemporaneous processes that are accompanied by daily xylem refilling. Here, we utilize an optical light transmission method to continuously monitor xylem cavitation in leaves of dehydrating grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) in concert with stomatal conductance and stem and petiole hydraulic measurements. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to continuously monitor xylem cavitation and flow rates in the stem of an intact vine during 10 d of dehydration. The results showed that complete stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e preceded the appearance of embolism in the leaves and the stem by several days. Basal leaves were more vulnerable to xylem embolism than apical leaves and, once embolized, were shed, thereby preventing further water loss and protecting the hydraulic integrity of younger leaves and the stem. As a result, embolism in the stem was minimal even when drought led to complete leaf shedding. These findings suggest that grapevine avoids xylem embolism rather than tolerates it.</p>

Is it safe to preserve the deltoid when resecting the proximal humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Resection of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humerus for the primary malignant bone   tumour sometimes requires <i>en bloc</i> resection of the   deltoid. However, there is no information in the literature which   helps a surgeon decide whether to preserve the deltoid or not. The   aim of this study was to determine whether retaining the deltoid   at the time of resection would increase the rate of local recurrence.   We also sought to identify the variables that persuade expert surgeons   to choose a deltoid sparing rather than deltoid resecting procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 45 patients who had undergone resection of a primary   malignant tumour of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humerus. There were 29 in the deltoid   sparing group and 16 in the deltoid resecting group. Imaging studies   were reviewed to assess tumour extension and soft-tissue involvement.   The presence of a fat rim separating the tumour from the deltoid   on MRI was particularly noted. The cumulative probability of local   recurrence was calculated in a competing risk scenario.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference (adjusted p = 0.89) in the   cumulative probability of local recurrence between the deltoid sparing   (7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 to 20) and the deltoid resecting   group (26%, 95% CI 8 to 50). Patients were more likely to be selected   for a deltoid sparing procedure if they presented with a small tumour   (p = 0.0064) with less bone involvement (p = 0.032) and a continuous   fat rim on MRI (p = 0.002) and if the axillary nerve could be identified   (p = 0.037).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A deltoid sparing procedure can provide good local control after   resection of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour.   A smaller tumour, the presence of a continuous fat rim and the identification   of the axillary nerve on pre-operative MRI will persuade surgeons   to opt for a deltoid resecting procedure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1244–9.</p></sec>

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of open tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in 24 (39%), delayed primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

The diagnostic performance of radiographic criteria to detect aseptic acetabular component loosening after revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of radiographic   criteria to detect aseptic acetabular loosening after revision total   hip arthroplasty (THA). Secondary aims were to determine the predictive   values of different thresholds of migration and to determine the   predictive values of radiolucency criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Acetabular component migration to re-revision was measured retrospectively   using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup) and manual measurements   (Sutherland method) in two groups: Group A, 52 components (48 patients) found   not loose at re-revision and Group B, 42 components (36 patients)   found loose at re-revision between 1980 and 2015. The presence and   extent of radiolucent lines was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using EBRA, both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al translation and sagittal rotation were   excellent diagnostic tests for detecting aseptic loosening. The   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was   0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The thresholds of 2.5 mm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al translation   or 2° sagittal rotation (EBRA) in combination with radiolucency   criteria had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88% to detect   aseptic loosening. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive   value and negative predictive value (NPV) of radiolucency criteria   were 41%, 100%, 100% and 68% respectively. Manual measurements of   both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al translation and sagittal rotation were very good diagnostic tests.   The area under the ROC curve was 0.86 and 0.92 respectively. However,   manual measurements had a decreased specificity compared with EBRA.   Radiolucency criteria had a poor sensitivity and NPV of 41% and   68% respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that EBRA and manual migration measurements   can be used as accurate diagnostic tools to detect aseptic loosening   of cementless acetabular components used at revision THA. Radiolucency   criteria should not be used in isolation to exclude loosening of   cementless acetabular components used at revision THA given their poor   sensitivity and NPV.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:458–64.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Loss or absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al femoral bone in revision total hip   arthroplasty (THA) remains a significant challenge. While the main   indication for the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al femoral replacements (PFRs) is   in the treatment of malignant disease, they have a valuable role   in revision THA for loosening, fracture and infection in patients   with bone loss.

Complexes of Usher proteins preassemble at the endoplasmic reticulum and are required for trafficking and ER homeostasis
<p>Usher syndrome (USH), the leading cause of hereditary combined hearing and vision loss, is characterized by sensorineural deafness and progressive retinal degeneration. Mutations in several different genes produce USH, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al cause of sensory cell death remains mysterious. We adapted a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>ity ligation assay to analyze associations among three of the USH proteins, Cdh23, Harmonin and Myo7aa, and the microtubule-based transporter Ift88 in zebrafish inner ear mechanosensory hair cells. We found that the proteins are in close enough <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>ity to form complexes and that these complexes preassemble at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Defects in any one of the three USH proteins disrupt formation and trafficking of the complex and result in diminished levels of the other proteins, generalized trafficking defects and ER stress that triggers apoptosis. ER stress, thus, contributes to sensory hair cell loss and provides a new target to explore for protective therapies for USH.</p>

Slowing blood flow to fight viral infection
<p>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes are the assassins of the immune system, delivering cell death through direct interactions with virally infected or cancerous cells. To successfully execute their mission, these CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells must navigate a number of key steps, including sensing and entering infected tissues, locating infected cells in the vast tissue space, and supplying the precise mediators or interactions needed to elicit target cell death. Failure, or viral interference, at any of these steps can have devastating consequences for the host, including the establishment of viral persistence. Although some of the pathways and mechanisms involved in T cell purging of viral infection are well understood, the rate of local blood flow in the infected tissue has not been carefully explored as a factor mediating viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clearanc</span></strong>e. On page 639 of this issue, Cox <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) demonstrate that T cells express the prototypical neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), which dilates blood vessels, slowing blood flow enough to enhance T cell entry into infected tissues and ultimately allowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clearanc</span></strong>e of chronic viral infection.</p>

Recurrent infection progressively disables host protection against intestinal inflammation
<p>Intestinal inflammation is the central pathological feature of colitis and the inflammatory bowel diseases. These syndromes arise from unidentified environmental factors. We found that recurrent nonlethal gastric infections of Gram-negative <i>Salmonella enterica</i> Typhimurium (ST), a major source of human food poisoning, caused inflammation of murine intestinal tissue, predominantly the colon, which persisted after pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clearanc</span></strong>e and irreversibly escalated in severity with repeated infections. ST progressively disabled a host mechanism of protection by inducing endogenous neuraminidase activity, which accelerated the molecular aging and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clearanc</span></strong>e of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP). Disease was linked to a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–dependent mechanism of IAP desialylation with accumulation of the IAP substrate and TLR4 ligand, lipopolysaccharide-phosphate. The administration of IAP or the antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir was therapeutic by maintaining IAP abundance and function.</p>

Mouse models of acute and chronic hepacivirus infection
<p>An estimated 71 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The lack of small-animal models has impeded studies of antiviral immune mechanisms. Here we show that an HCV-related hepacivirus discovered in Norway rats can establish high-titer hepatotropic infections in laboratory mice with immunological features resembling those seen in human viral hepatitis. Whereas immune-compromised mice developed persistent infection, immune-competent mice cleared the virus within 3 to 5 weeks. Acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clearanc</span></strong>e was T cell dependent and associated with liver injury.

An adipo-biliary-uridine axis that regulates energy homeostasis
<p>Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside present at high levels in the plasma of rodents and humans, is critical for RNA synthesis, glycogen deposition, and many other essential cellular processes. It also contributes to systemic metabolism, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We found that plasma uridine levels are regulated by fasting and refeeding in mice, rats, and humans. Fasting increases plasma uridine levels, and this increase relies largely on adipocytes. In contrast, refeeding reduces plasma uridine levels through biliary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clearanc</span></strong>e. Elevation of plasma uridine is required for the drop in body temperature that occurs during fasting. Further, feeding-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clearanc</span></strong>e of plasma uridine improves glucose metabolism. We also present findings that implicate leptin signaling in uridine homeostasis and consequent metabolic control and thermoregulation. Our results indicate that plasma uridine governs energy homeostasis and thermoregulation in a mechanism involving adipocyte-dependent uridine biosynthesis and leptin signaling.</p>

SULTR3s Function in Chloroplast Sulfate Uptake and Affect ABA Biosynthesis and the Stress Response
<p>Plants are major sulfur reducers in the global sulfur cycle. Sulfate, the major natural sulfur source in soil, is absorbed by plant roots and transported into plastids, where it is reduced and assimilated into Cys for further metabolic processes. Despite its importance, how sulfate is transported into plastids is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated using single Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genetic mutants that each member of the sulfate transporter (SULTR) subfamily 3 was able to transport sulfate across the chloroplast envelope membrane. To resolve the function of SULTR3s, we constructed a <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant completely knocking out all five members of the subfamily. Here we report that all members of the <i>SULTR3</i> subfamily show chloroplast membrane localization. Sulfate uptake by chloroplasts of the quintuple mutant is reduced by more than 50% compared with the wild type. Consequently, Cys and abscisic acid (ABA) content are reduced to ∼67 and ∼20% of the wild-type level, respectively, and strong positive correlations are found among sulfate, Cys, and ABA content. The <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant shows obvious growth retardation with smaller rosettes and shorter roots. Seed germination of the <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and salt stress, but is rescued by sulfide supplementation. Furthermore, sulfate-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e is abolished in the quintuple mutant, strongly suggesting that chloroplast sulfate is required for stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e. Our genetic analyses unequivocally demonstrate that sulfate transporter subfamily 3 is responsible for more than half of the chloroplast sulfate uptake and influences downstream sulfate assimilation and ABA biosynthesis.</p>

Hydraulics Regulate Stomatal Responses to Changes in Leaf Water Status in the Fern <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>
<p>Stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status are important for the diurnal regulation of gas exchange and the survival of plants during drought. These stomatal responses in angiosperm species are well characterized, yet in species of nonseed plants, an ongoing debate surrounds the role of metabolism, particularly the role of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), in functionally regulating stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status. Here, we measured the stomatal response to changes in vapor pressure difference (VPD) in two natural forms of the fern species <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>, recently suggested to have stomata that are regulated by ABA. The two forms measured had considerable differences in key hydraulic traits, including leaf hydraulic conductance and capacitance, as well as the kinetics of stomatal response to changes in VPD. In both forms, the stomatal responses to VPD could be accurately predicted by a dynamic, mechanistic model that assumes guard cell turgor changes in concert with leaf turgor in the light, and not via metabolic processes including the level of ABA. During drought, endogenous ABA did not play a role in stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e, and exogenous ABA applied to live, intact leaves did not induce stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e. Our results indicate that functional stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status in ferns are regulated by leaf hydraulics and not metabolism. With ferns being sister to seed plants, this result has implications for the evolutionary reconstruction of functional stomatal responses across vascular land plant lineages.</p>

RNA Polymerase II Read-Through Promotes Expression of Neighboring Genes in SAL1-PAP-XRN Retrograde Signaling
<p>In plants, the molecular function(s) of the nucleus-localized 5′-3′ EXORIBONUCLEASES (XRNs) are unclear; however, their activity is reported to have a significant effect on gene expression and SAL1-mediated retrograde signaling. Using parallel analysis of RNA ends, we documented a dramatic increase in uncapped RNA substrates of the XRNs in both <i>sal1</i> and <i>xrn2xrn3</i> mutants. We found that a major consequence of reducing SAL1 or XRN activity was RNA Polymerase II 3′ read-through. This occurred at 72% of expressed genes, demonstrating a major genome-wide role for the XRN-torpedo model of transcription termination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Read-through is speculated to have a negative effect on transcript abundance; however, we did not observe this. Rather, we identified a strong association between read-through and increased transcript abundance of tandemly orientated downstream genes, strongly correlated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>ity (less than 1,000 bp) and expression of the upstream gene. We observed read-through in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>ity of 903 genes up-regulated in the <i>sal1-8</i> retrograde signaling mutant; thus, this phenomenon may account directly for up to 23% of genes up-regulated in <i>sal1-8</i>. Using <i>APX2</i> and <i>AT5G43770</i> as exemplars, we genetically uncoupled read-through loci from downstream genes to validate the principle of read-through-mediated mRNA regulation, providing one mechanism by which an ostensibly posttranscriptional exoribonuclease that targets uncapped RNAs could modulate gene expression.</p>

Actin Reorganization Triggers Rapid Cell Elongation in Roots
<p>Root growth is controlled by mechanisms underlying cell division and cell elongation, which respond to various internal and external factors. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), cells produced in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al meristem (PM) elongate and differentiate in the transition zone (TZ) and the elongation/differentiation zone (EDZ). Previous studies have demonstrated that endoreplication is involved in root cell elongation; however, the manner by which cells increase in length by more than 2-fold remains unknown. Here, we show that epidermal and cortical cells in Arabidopsis roots undergo two modes of rapid cell elongation: the first rapid cell elongation occurs at the border of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al meristem and the TZ, and the second mode occurs during the transition from the TZ to the EDZ. Our previous study showed that cytokinin signaling promotes endoreplication, which triggers the first rapid cell elongation. Our cytological and genetic data revealed that the second rapid cell elongation involves dynamic actin reorganization independent of endoreplication. Cytokinins promote actin bundling and the resultant second rapid cell elongation through activating the signaling pathway involving the cytokinin receptors ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE3 (AHK3) and AHK4 and the B-type transcription factor ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR2. Our results suggest that cytokinins promote the two modes of rapid cell elongation by controlling distinct cellular events: endoreplication and actin reorganization.</p>

Carbonic Anhydrase Mutants in <i>Zea mays</i> Have Altered Stomatal Responses to Environmental Signals
<p>Stomata regulate transpirational water loss and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis in response to changing environmental conditions. Research investigating stomatal movement has mostly been conducted in C<sub>3</sub> eudicot species, which have very different CO<sub>2</sub> requirements for photosynthesis relative to C<sub>4</sub> grasses. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub>, and its activity has been linked to stomatal aperture regulation in eudicots. The number of <i>Ca</i> genes and their evolutionary history differ between monocots and dicots, and many questions remain unanswered about potential neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization of grass <i>Ca</i> paralogs and their roles in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. To investigate the roles of different <i>Ca</i> genes in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we examined stomatal responses in <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants as well as a <i>ca1ca2</i> double mutant. The <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants had 10% and 87% of the CA activity exhibited by the wild type, respectively, while <i>ca1ca2</i> had less than 5% of wild-type CA activity. The <i>ca</i> mutants had higher stomatal conductance than the wild type and slower stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in response to increases in CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure. Contrary to previous reports in eudicots, <i>ca</i> mutants showed slowed stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in response to the light-dark transition and did not show differences in stomatal density compared with the wild type. These results implicate CA-mediated signaling in the control of stomatal movement but not stomatal development. Drought experiments with <i>ca1ca2</i> mutant plants suggest a role for CA in water-use efficiency and reveal that <i>Z. mays</i> is not optimized for water-use efficiency under well-watered conditions.</p>

Calcium Pumps and Interacting BON1 Protein Modulate Calcium Signature, Stomatal Closure, and Plant Immunity
<p>Calcium signaling is essential for environmental responses including immune responses. Here, we provide evidence that the evolutionarily conserved protein BONZAI1 (BON1) functions together with autoinhibited calcium ATPase10 (ACA10) and ACA8 to regulate calcium signals in Arabidopsis. BON1 is a plasma membrane localized protein that negatively regulates the expression of immune receptor genes and positively regulates stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e. We found that BON1 interacts with the autoinhibitory domains of ACA10 and ACA8, and the <i>aca10</i> loss-of-function (LOF) mutants have an autoimmune phenotype similar to that of the <i>bon1</i> LOF mutants. Genetic evidences indicate that BON1 positively regulates the activities of ACA10 and ACA8. Consistent with this idea, the steady level of calcium concentration is increased in both <i>aca10</i> and <i>bon1</i> mutants. Most strikingly, cytosolic calcium oscillation imposed by external calcium treatment was altered in <i>aca10</i>, <i>aca8</i>, and <i>bon1</i> mutants in guard cells. In addition, calcium- and pathogen-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e was compromised in the <i>aca10</i> and <i>bon1</i> mutants. Taken together, this study indicates that ACA10/8 and BON1 physically interact on plasma membrane and function in the generation of cytosol calcium signatures that are critical for stomatal movement and impact plant immunity.</p>

A Dual Role for the OsK5.2 Ion Channel in Stomatal Movements and K<sup>+</sup> Loading into Xylem Sap<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The roles of potassium channels from the Shaker family in stomatal movements have been investigated by reverse genetics analyses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but corresponding information is lacking outside this model species. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and other cereals possess stomata that are more complex than those of Arabidopsis. We examined the role of the outward Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel gene <i>OsK5.2.</i> Expression of the <i>OsK5.2</i> gene (<i>GUS</i> reporter strategy) was observed in the whole stomatal complex (guard cells and subsidiary cells), root vasculature, and root cortex. In stomata, loss of <i>OsK5.2</i> functional expression resulted in lack of time-dependent outward potassium currents in guard cells, higher rates of water loss through transpiration, and severe slowdown of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e. In line with the expression of OsK5.2 in the plant vasculature, mutant plants displayed a reduced K<sup>+</sup> translocation from the root system toward the leaves via the xylem. The comparison between rice and Arabidopsis show that despite the strong conservation of Shaker family in plants, substantial differences can exist between the physiological roles of seemingly orthologous genes, as xylem loading depends on SKOR and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e on GORK in Arabidopsis, whereas both functions are executed by the single OsK5.2 Shaker in rice.</p>

The Role of ENHANCED RESPONSES TO ABA1 (ERA1) in Arabidopsis Stomatal Responses Is Beyond ABA Signaling
<p>Proper stomatal responses are essential for plant function in an altered environment. The core signaling pathway for abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e involves perception of the hormone that leads to the activation of guard cell anion channels by the protein kinase OPEN STOMATA1. Several other regulators are suggested to modulate the ABA signaling pathway, including the protein ENHANCED RESPONSE TO ABA1 (ERA1), that encodes the farnesyl transferase β-subunit. The <i>era1</i> mutant is hypersensitive to ABA during seed germination and shows a more closed stomata phenotype. Using a genetics approach with the double mutants <i>era1 abi1-1</i> and <i>era1 ost1</i>, we show that while <i>era1</i> suppressed the high stomatal conductance of <i>abi1-1</i> and <i>ost1</i>, the ERA1 function was not required for stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in response to ABA and environmental factors. Further experiments indicated a role for ERA1 in blue light-induced stomatal opening. In addition, we show that ERA1 function in disease resistance was independent of its role in stomatal regulation. Our results indicate a function for ERA1 in stomatal opening and pathogen immunity.</p>

Fern Stomatal Responses to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> Depend on Species and Growth Conditions
<p>Changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, climate, and air humidity affect plant gas exchange that is controlled by stomata, small pores on plant leaves and stems formed by guard cells. Evolution has shaped the morphology and regulatory mechanisms governing stomatal movements to correspond to the needs of various land plant groups over the past 400 million years. Stomata close in response to the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and reduced air humidity. Whether the active regulatory mechanisms that control stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in response to these stimuli are present already in mosses, the oldest plant group with stomata, or were acquired more recently in angiosperms remains controversial. It has been suggested that the stomata of the basal vascular plants, such as ferns and lycophytes, close solely hydropassively. On the other hand, active stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in response to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> was found in several moss, lycophyte, and fern species. Here, we show that the stomata of two temperate fern species respond to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> and that an active mechanism of stomatal regulation in response to reduced air humidity is present in some ferns. Importantly, fern stomatal responses depend on growth conditions. The data indicate that the stomatal behavior of ferns is more complex than anticipated before, and active stomatal regulation is present in some ferns and has possibly been lost in others. Further analysis that takes into account fern species, life history, evolutionary age, and growth conditions is required to gain insight into the evolution of land plant stomatal responses.</p>

Evolutionary Conservation of ABA Signaling for Stomatal Closure<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA)-driven stomatal regulation reportedly evolved after the divergence of ferns, during the early evolution of seed plants ap<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>ately 360 million years ago. This hypothesis is based on the observation that the stomata of certain fern species are unresponsive to ABA, but exhibit passive hydraulic control. However, ABA-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e was detected in some mosses and lycophytes. Here, we observed that a number of ABA signaling and membrane transporter protein families diversified over the evolutionary history of land plants. The aquatic ferns <i>Azolla filiculoides</i> and <i>Salvinia cucullata</i> have representatives of 23 families of proteins orthologous to those of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and all other land plant species studied. Phylogenetic analysis of the key ABA signaling proteins indicates an evolutionarily conserved stomatal response to ABA. Moreover, comparative transcriptomic analysis has identified a suite of ABA-responsive genes that differentially expressed in a terrestrial fern species, <i>Polystichum proliferum</i>. These genes encode proteins associated with ABA biosynthesis, transport, reception, transcription, signaling, and ion and sugar transport, which fit the general ABA signaling pathway constructed from Arabidopsis and <i>Hordeum vulgare</i>. The retention of these key ABA-responsive genes could have had a profound effect on the adaptation of ferns to dry conditions. Furthermore, stomatal assays have shown the primary evidence for ABA-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e of stomata in two terrestrial fern species <i>P</i>. <i>proliferum</i> and <i>Nephrolepis exaltata</i>. In summary, we report, to our knowledge, new molecular and physiological evidence for the presence of active stomatal control in ferns.</p>

Two Chloroplast Proteins Suppress Drought Resistance by Affecting ROS Production in Guard Cells
<p>Chloroplast as the site for photosynthesis is an essential organelle in plants, but little is known about its role in stomatal regulation and drought resistance. In this study, we show that two chloroplastic proteins essential for thylakoid formation negatively regulate drought resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). By screening a mutant pool with T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes encoding chloroplastic proteins, we identified an <i>HCF106</i> knockdown mutant exhibiting increased resistance to drought stress. The <i>hcf106</i> mutant displayed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, improved stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e, and reduced water loss under drought conditions. The HCF106 protein was found to physically interact with THF1, a previously identified chloroplastic protein crucial for thylakoid formation. The <i>thf1</i> mutant phenotypically resembled the <i>hcf106</i> mutant and displayed more ROS accumulation in guard cells, increased stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e, reduced water loss, and drought resistant phenotypes compared to the wild type. The <i>hcf106thf1</i> double mutant behaved similarly as the <i>thf1</i> single mutant. These results suggest that HCF106 and THF1 form a complex to modulate chloroplast function and that the complex is important for ROS production in guard cells and stomatal control in response to environmental stresses. Our results also suggest that modulating chloroplastic proteins could be a way for improving drought resistance in crops.</p>

Regulation of Stomatal Defense by Air Relative Humidity
<p>It has long been observed that environmental conditions play crucial roles in modulating immunity and disease in plants and animals. For instance, many bacterial plant disease outbreaks occur after periods of high humidity and rain. A critical step in bacterial infection is entry into the plant interior through wounds and natural openings, such as stomata, which are adjustable microscopic pores in the epidermal tissue. Several studies have shown that stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e is an integral part of the plant immune response to reduce pathogen invasion. In this study, we found that high humidity can effectively compromise <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>-triggered stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in both <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), which is accompanied by early up-regulation of the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway and simultaneous down-regulation of salicylic acid (SA) pathway in guard cells. Furthermore, SA-dependent response, but not JA-dependent response, is faster in guard cells than in whole leaves, suggesting that the SA signaling in guard cells may be independent from other cell types. Thus, we conclude that high humidity, a well-known disease-promoting environmental condition, acts in part by suppressing stomatal defense and is linked to hormone signaling in guard cells.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to observe an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental population genetic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clearanc</span></strong>e rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding mutations including common mutations outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clearanc</span></strong>e rate. Mutations were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of mutation and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid mutations confer resistance providing a large mutational target—we estimate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population mutation parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be estimated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> estimated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously underestimated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may underestimate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously estimated.</p>

Total hip arthroplasty using a monobloc cementless femoral stem for patients with childhood Perthes’ disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Modular or custom-made femoral components have been preferred   for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with a history of Perthes’   disease because of the distortion in the anatomy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al   femur. However, it has not been established whether a monobloc cementless   stem will fit the distorted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al femur or whether the results   of the procedure are satisfactory in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 68 consecutive patients who had undergone THA for   childhood Perthes’ disease between June 2003 and December 2008.   There were 35 men and 33 women with a mean age of 48 years (16 to   73) at the time of index arthroplasty. Their mean body mass index   was 24.4 (18.3 to 32.9). Of the 68 hips, 32 were classified as Stulberg   class III and 36 as class IV. The mean pre-operative shortening   of the affected leg was 17.2 mm (5 to 34). The minimum follow-up   was five years (mean 8.5 years; 5.2 to 10).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>An intra-operative calcar fracture occurred in eight hips (11.8%)   and was successfully treated by cerclage wiring. The mean stem version   was 14.6° (-2.3 to 30; standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 7.3). The   mean acetabular component abduction was 40.2° (23.7 to 56.0; <sc>sd</sc> 6.5)   and the mean anteversion 28.3° (6.4 to 43.0; <sc>sd</sc> 7.6), respectively.   The mean follow-up was 8.5 years (5.2 to 10). No dislocations occurred   and no hips were revised during the course of the study. At final   follow-up, the mean Harris Hip Score was 91 points (59 to 100) and   the mean University of California, Los Angeles activity score was   3.2 (2 to 8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Monobloc cementless stems reliably restore the anatomy in Perthes’   disease at THA without the need for custom-made or modular implants.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:440–444.</p></sec>

Proximal femoral resection without post-operative traction for the painful dislocated hip in young patients with cerebral palsy
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al femoral resection (PFR) is a proven   pain-relieving procedure for the management of patients with severe cerebral   palsy and a painful displaced hip. Previous authors have recommended   post-operative traction or immobilisation to prevent a recurrence   of pain due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al migration of the femoral stump. We present   a series of 79 PFRs in 63 patients, age 14.7 years (10 to 26; 35   male, 28 female), none of whom had post-operative traction or immobilisation.</p><p>A total of 71 hips (89.6%) were reported to be pain free or to   have mild pain following surgery. Four children underwent further   resection for persistent pain; of these, three had successful resolution   of pain and one had no benefit. A total of 16 hips (20.2%) showed   radiographic evidence of heterotopic ossification, all of which   had formed within one year of surgery. Four patients had a wound   infection, one of which needed debridement; all recovered fully.   A total of 59 patients (94%) reported improvements in seating and   hygiene.</p><p>The results are as good as or better than the historical results   of using traction or immobilisation. We recommend that following   PFR, children can be managed without traction or immobilisation,   and can be discharged earlier and with fewer complications. However,   care should be taken with severely dystonic patients, in whom more   extensive femoral resection should be considered in combination   with management of the increased tone.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:701–6.</p>

Monostotic fibrous dysplasia of the proximal femur
<p>Monostotic fibrous dysplasia of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al   femur has a variable clinical course, despite its reported limited tendency   to progress.</p><p>We investigated the natural history and predisposing factors   for progression of dysplasia in a group of 76 patients with a mean   follow-up of 8.5 years (2.0 to 15.2). Of these, 31 (41%) presented   with an asymptomatic incidental lesion while 45 (59%) presented   with pain or a pathological fracture. A group of 23 patients (30%)   underwent early operative treatment for pain (19: 25%) or pathological   fracture (4: 5%).</p><p>Of the 53 patients who were initially treated non-operatively,   45 (85%) remained asymptomatic but eight (15%) needed surgery because   of pain or fracture. The progression-free survival of the observation   group was 81% (<sc>sd</sc> 6.4%) at five-years follow-up. An initial   presentation of pain (p < 0.001), a limp (p < 0.001), radiological   evidence of microfracture (p = 0.001) and younger age (< 17 years)   (p = 0.016) were significant predisposing factors for disease progression.</p><p>The risk of experiencing pain or pathological fracture is considerable   in monostotic fibrous dysplasia of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al femur. Patients   presenting with pain, a limp or radiological evidence of microfracture   have a high chance of needing surgical treatment.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:673–6.</p>

Hemiarthroplasty proximal femoral endoprostheses following tumour reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Dislocation rates are reportedly lower in patients requiring   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al femoral hemiarthroplasty than for patients undergoing hip   arthroplasty for neoplasia. Without acetabular replacement, pain   due to acetabular wear necessitating revision surgery has been described.   We aimed to determine whether wear of the native acetabulum following   hemiarthroplasty necessitates revision surgery with secondary replacement   of the acetabulum after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al femoral replacement (PFR) for tumour   reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 100 consecutive PFRs performed between January 2003   and January 2013 without acetabular resurfacing. The procedure was   undertaken in 74 patients with metastases, for a primary bone tumour   in 20 and for myeloma in six. There were 48 male and 52 female patients,   with a mean age of 61.4 years (19 to 85) and median follow-up of   two years (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5 to 3.7 years). In total,   52 patients presented with a pathological fracture and six presented   with failed fixation of a previously instrumented pathological fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All patients underwent reconstruction with either a unipolar   (n = 64) or bipolar (n = 36) articulation. There were no dislocations   and no acetabular resurfacings. Articular wear was graded using   the criteria of Baker et al from 0 to 3, where by 0 is normal; grade   1 represents a narrowing of articular cartilage and no bone erosion;   grade 2 represents acetabular bone erosion and early migration;   and grade 3 represents protrusio acetabuli. Of the 49 patients with radiological   follow-up greater than one year, six demonstrated grade 1 acetabular   wear and two demonstrated grade 2 acetabular wear. The remainder   demonstrated no radiographic evidence of wear. Median medial migration was   0.3 mm (IQR -0.2 to 0.7) and superior migration was 0.3 mm (IQR   -0.2 to 0.6). No relationship between unipolar <i>versus</i> bipolar   articulations and wear was evident.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Hemiarthroplasty PFRs for tumour reconstruction eliminate joint   instability and, in the short to medium term, do not lead to native   acetabular wear necessitating later acetabular resurfacing.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100B:101–8.</p></sec>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap junction remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>ity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral gap junction proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were identified as novel mRNA targets of FXR1 by using a BioID <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>ity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and stabilization of its mRNA targets in heart muscle. In addition, introduction of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of gap junctions and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in disease progression by regulating gap junction remodeling. Together this study provides a novel function of FXR1, namely, that it directly regulates major gap junction components, contributing to proper cell-cell communication in the heart.</p></sec>

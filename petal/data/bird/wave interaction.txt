Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host gene-NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in causing disease. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Systematic analysis of complex genetic interactions
<p>To systematically explore complex genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, we constructed ~200,000 yeast triple mutants and scored negative trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. We selected double-mutant query genes across a broad spectrum of biological processes, spanning a range of quantitative features of the global digenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network and tested for a genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with a third mutation. Trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic network. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. We estimate that the global trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network is ~100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions to affect the biology of inheritance, including the genotype-to-phenotype relationship.</p>

A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring diagram of cellular function
<p>We generated a global genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. This comprehensive network maps genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>es corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality.

Generation of specific inhibitors of SUMO-1– and SUMO-2/3–mediated protein-protein interactions using Affimer (Adhiron) technology
<p>Because protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions underpin most biological processes, developing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the development of therapeutics is an important task. SUMOylation is the posttranslational covalent attachment of proteins in the SUMO family (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3), and it regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated proteins are recognized by proteins with SUMO-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion motifs (SIMs) that facilitate noncovalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with SUMO. We describe the use of the Affimer system of peptide display for the rapid isolation of synthetic binding proteins that inhibit SUMO-dependent protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions mediated by SIMs both in vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic proteins did not prevent SUMO conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific analysis of SUMO-mediated protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. Furthermore, through structural analysis and molecular modeling, we explored the molecular mechanisms that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO-1–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions mediated by either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Not only will these reagents enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, but the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding proteins could also be exploited to design or validate reagents or therapeutics that target other protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions.</p>

RAF1/BRAF dimerization integrates the signal from RAS to ERK and ROKα
<p>Downstream of growth factor receptors and of the guanine triphosphatase (GTPase) RAS, heterodimers of the serine/threonine kinases BRAF and RAF1 are critical upstream kinases and activators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e containing the mitogen-activated and extracellular signal–regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and their targets, the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) family. Either direct or scaffold protein–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions among the components of the ERK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e (the MAPKKKs BRAF and RAF1, MEK, and ERK) facilitate signal transmission. RAF1 also has essential functions in the control of tumorigenesis and migration that are mediated through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with the kinase ROKα, an effector of the GTPase RHO and regulator of cytoskeletal rearrangements. We combined mutational and kinetic analysis with mathematical modeling to show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of RAF1 with ROKα is coordinated with the role of RAF1 in the ERK pathway. We found that the phosphorylated form of RAF1 that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with and inhibited ROKα was generated during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of RAF1 with the ERK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e. This mechanism adds plasticity to the ERK pathway, enabling signal diversification at the level of both ERK and RAF. Furthermore, by connecting ERK activation with the regulation of ROKα and cytoskeletal rearrangements by RAF1, this mechanism has the potential to precisely coordinate the proper timing of proliferation with changes in cell shape, adhesion, or motility.</p>

Isoscapes resolve species-specific spatial patterns in plant–plant interactions in an invaded Mediterranean dune ecosystem
<p>Environmental heterogeneity and plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions are key factors shaping plant communities. However, the spatial dimension of plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions has seldom been addressed in field studies. This is at least partially rooted in a lack of methods that can accurately resolve functional processes in a spatially explicit manner. Isoscapes, that is, spatially explicit representations of stable isotope data, provide a versatile means to trace functional changes on spatial scales, for example, related to N-cycling (foliar δ<sup>15</sup>N) and water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub>, foliar δ<sup>13</sup>C). In a case study in a nutrient-depleted Mediterranean dune ecosystem, we analysed the spatial impact of the invasive N<sub>2</sub>-fixing <i>Acacia longifolia</i> on three native species of different functional types using δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Isoscapes revealed strong spatial patterns in δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C with pronounced species-specific differences, demonstrating distinct spatial ranges of plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. A coniferous tree and an ericaceous dwarf shrub showed significant enrichment in δ<sup>15</sup>N within a range of 5–8 m surrounding the canopy of <i>A. longifolia</i>, indicating input of N originating from symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation by the invader. In the dwarf shrub, which was most responsive to invader influence, enrichment in δ<sup>13</sup>C additionally demonstrated spatially explicit changes to WUE<sub>i</sub>, while a native N<sub>2</sub>-fixer was unresponsive to the presence of the invader. Furthermore, δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes yielded different patterns, indicating that plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions can have distinct spatial distributions and ranges based on the process measured. Additionally, the magnitude of the effect differed between field situations with high and low invasion pressure. This study highlights that the spatial scale must be accounted for when assessing the effects and outcome of species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. Functional tracers such as stable isotopes enable us to quantify spatial ranges of plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, providing empirical data that can help to better understand and predict complex species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in multifaceted natural environments.</p>

Microtubule structures underlying the sarcoplasmic reticulum support peripheral coupling sites to regulate smooth muscle contractility
<p>Junctional membrane complexes facilitate excitation-contraction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells by forming subcellular invaginations that maintain close (≤20 nm) proximity of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the plasma membrane. In fully differentiated smooth muscle cells, junctional membrane complexes occur as distributed sites of peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. We investigated the role of the cytoskeleton in maintaining peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing and associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling networks within native smooth muscle cells of mouse and rat cerebral arteries. Using live-cell confocal and superresolution microscopy, we found that the tight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions between the SR and the plasma membrane in these cells relied on arching microtubule structures present at the periphery of smooth muscle cells and were independent of the actin cytoskeleton. Loss of peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing associated with microtubule depolymerization altered the spatiotemporal properties of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks generated by the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through type 2 RyRs (RyR2s) on the SR and decreased the number of sites of colocalization between RyR2s and large-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channels. The reduced BK channel activity associated with the loss of SR–plasma membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions was accompanied by increased pressure–induced constriction of cerebral resistance arteries. We conclude that microtubule structures maintain peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing in contractile smooth muscle cells, which is crucial for the regulation of contractility and cerebral vascular tone.</p>

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression
<p>Ion channels regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in normal and neoplastic cells through cell-cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) transmembrane receptors called integrins. K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human ether-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) channel shapes action potential firing in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in tumors, where it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human cancer cells. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion. Although open hERG1 channels did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed channels, current flow through hERG1 channels was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and cancer cells. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in breast cancer cells expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas metastasis of breast cancer cells was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion was disrupted. We conclude that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 channels in cancer cells stimulated distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of tumor progression.</p>

pTAC10, a Key Subunit of Plastid-Encoded RNA Polymerase, Promotes Chloroplast Development
<p>Regulation of photosynthetic gene expression by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) is essential for chloroplast development. The activity of PEP largely relies on at least 12 PEP-associated proteins (PAPs) encoded in the nuclear genome of plant cells. A recent model proposed that these PAPs regulate the establishment of the PEP complex through broad PAP-PEP or PAP-PAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. In this study, we identified the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedling-lethal mutant <i>ptac10-1</i>, which has defects in chloroplast development, and found that the mutant phenotype is caused by the suppression of <i>PLASTID S1 RNA-BINDING DOMAIN PROTEIN</i> (<i>pTAC10/PAP3</i>). Analysis of the heterozygous mutant and <i>pTAC10</i>-overexpressing transgenic plants indicated that the expression level of <i>pTAC10</i> is tightly linked to chloroplast development. Characterization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of pTAC10 with PAPs revealed that pTAC10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>s with other PAPs, such as FSD2, FSD3, TrxZ, pTAC7, and pTAC14, but it does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with PEP core enzymes, such as rpoA and rpoB. Analysis of pTAC10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions using truncated pTAC10 proteins showed that the pTAC10 carboxyl-terminal region downstream of the S1 domain is involved in the pTAC10-PAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion. Furthermore, overexpression of truncated <i>pTAC10s</i> lacking the C-terminal regions downstream of the S1 domain could not rescue the <i>ptac10-1</i> mutant phenotype and induced an abnormal whitening phenotype in Columbia-0 plants. Our observations suggested that these pTAC10-PAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions are essential for the formation of the PEP complex and chloroplast development.</p>

Structure of the C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor module of Trio in an autoinhibited conformation reveals its oncogenic potential
<p>The C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e of Trio (TrioC) transfers signals from the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins to the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RhoA, enabling Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptors (GPCRs) to control downstream events, such as cell motility and gene transcription. This conserved signal transduction axis is crucial for tumor growth in uveal melanoma. Previous studies indicate that the GEF activity of the TrioC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e is autoinhibited, with release of autoinhibition upon Gα<sub>q/11</sub> binding. Here, we determined the crystal structure of TrioC in its basal state and found that the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>s with the Dbl homology (DH) domain in a manner that occludes the Rho GTPase binding site, thereby suggesting the molecular basis of TrioC autoinhibition. Biochemical and biophysical assays revealed that disruption of the autoinhibited conformation destabilized and activated the TrioC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e in vitro. Last, mutations in the DH-PH interface found in patients with cancer activated TrioC and, in the context of full-length Trio, led to increased abundance of guanosine triphosphate–bound RhoA (RhoA·GTP) in human cells. These mutations increase mitogenic signaling through the RhoA axis and, therefore, may represent cancer drivers operating in a Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-independent manner.</p>

Release of Gβγ subunits from activated G proteins decreases the activity of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs), decreasing excitability. A less understood Gβγ-mediated mechanism downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is the binding of Gβγ to SNARE complexes, which facilitate the fusion of vesicles with the cell plasma membrane in exocytosis. Here, we generated mice expressing a form of the SNARE protein SNAP25 with premature truncation of the C terminus and that were therefore partially deficient in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion. SNAP25Δ3 homozygote mice exhibited normal presynaptic inhibition by GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, which inhibit VGCCs, but defective presynaptic inhibition by receptors that work directly on the SNARE complex, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 5-HT<sub>1b</sub> receptors and adrenergic α<sub>2a</sub> receptors. Simultaneously stimulating receptors that act through both mechanisms showed synergistic inhibitory effects.

Oligomerization of MrgC11 and μ-opioid receptors in sensory neurons enhances morphine analgesia
<p>The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist morphine is commonly used for pain management, but it has severe adverse effects and produces analgesic tolerance. Thus, alternative ways of stimulating MOR activity are needed. We found that MrgC11, a sensory neuron–specific G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptor, may form heteromeric complexes with MOR. Peptide-mediated activation of MrgC11 enhanced MOR recycling by inducing coendocytosis and sorting of MOR for membrane reinsertion. MrgC11 activation also inhibited the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing of MOR to β-arrestin-2 and enhanced the morphine-dependent inhibition of cAMP production. Intrathecal coadministration of a low dose of an MrgC agonist potentiated acute morphine analgesia and reduced chronic morphine tolerance in wild-type mice but not in <i>Mrg</i>-cluster knockout (Mrg KO) mice. BAM22, a bivalent agonist of MrgC and opioid receptors, enhanced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between MrgC11 and MOR and produced stronger analgesia than did the individual monovalent agonists. Morphine-induced neuronal and pain inhibition was reduced in Mrg KO mice compared to that in wild-type mice. Our results uncover MrgC11-MOR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions that lead to positive functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of MOR. MrgC shares genetic homogeneity and functional similarity with human MrgX1. Thus, harnessing this positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of MOR function by Mrg signaling may enhance morphine analgesia in a sensory neuron–specific fashion to limit central side effects.</p>

The process starts by regioselective phosphorus substitution of the C–H bonds para to nitrogen in two successive heterocycles; ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing is then triggered via acidic alcohol solutions to form the heterobiaryl bond. Mechanistic studies imply that ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing is an asynchronous process involving migration of one heterocycle to the ipso position of the other around a central pentacoordinate P(V) atom. The strategy can be applied to complex drug-like molecules containing multiple reactive sites and polar functional groups, and also enables convergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing of drug fragments and late-stage heteroarylation of pharmaceuticals.</p>

If two deletions don't stop growth, try three
<p>How many and which genes does an organism need at a minimum to sustain growth? With the identification of essential genes in a variety of organisms such as yeast (<i>1</i>), worms (<i>2</i>), and human cultured cells (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>), the answer may seem obvious: Remove all nonessential genes, and the organism should be able to continue to survive and grow. In the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the workhorse of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion mapping, ∼1000 of the ∼6000 (∼17%) protein-coding genes are essential for viability (<i>1</i>). So theoretically, one might think that one could remove the other ∼5000 nonessential genes and still have a growing yeast. The reason this does not work is that genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with each other to drive different traits, including viability and growth. On page 283 of this issue, Kuzmin <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) provide the first systematic analysis of trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in yeast in which three gene deletions are combined in individual strains in order to ascertain the importance of multigene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions for growth. This study shows that higher-order genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions are abundant, which has implications for the interpretation of human gene variants that may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> to affect health and disease.</p>

Thermal proximity coaggregation for system-wide profiling of protein complex dynamics in cells
<p>Proteins differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with each other across cellular states and conditions, but an efficient proteome-wide strategy to monitor them is lacking. We report the application of thermal proximity coaggregation (TPCA) for high-throughput intracellular monitoring of protein complex dynamics. Significant TPCA signatures observed among well-validated protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions correlate positively with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion stoichiometry and are statistically observable in more than 350 annotated human protein complexes.

Comparison of six cell lines by TPCA revealed cell-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions even in fundamental cellular processes.

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-phonon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-phonon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “coherent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-phonon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions.</p>

A dedicated network for social interaction processing in the primate brain

Exclusivity of specialization was found for no other function anywhere in the brain. Two additional networks, a parieto-premotor and a temporal one, exhibited both social and physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion preference, which, in the temporal lobe, mapped onto a fine-grain pattern of object, body, and face selectivity.

SIPP, a Novel Mitochondrial Phosphate Carrier, Mediates in Self-Incompatibility
<p>In Solanaceae, the <i>S</i>-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between the pistil S-RNase and the pollen <i>S</i>-Locus F-box protein controls self-incompatibility (SI). Although this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion defines the specificity of the pollen rejection response, the identification of three pistil essential modifier genes unlinked to the <i>S</i>-locus (<i>HT-B</i>, <i>120K</i>, and <i>NaStEP</i>) unveils a higher degree of complexity in the pollen rejection pathway. We showed previously that NaStEP, a stigma protein with homology with Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, is essential to SI in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. During pollination, NaStEP is taken up by pollen tubes, where potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with pollen tube proteins might underlie its function. Here, we identified NaSIPP, a mitochondrial protein with phosphate transporter activity, as a novel NaStEP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing protein. Coexpression of NaStEP and NaSIPP in pollen tubes showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion in the mitochondria, although when expressed alone, NaStEP remains mostly cytosolic, implicating NaSIPP-mediated translocation of NaStEP into the organelle. The <i>NaSIPP</i> transcript is detected specifically in mature pollen of <i>Nicotiana</i> spp.; however, in self-compatible plants, this gene has accumulated mutations, so its coding region is unlikely to produce a functional protein. RNA interference suppression of NaSIPP in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. pollen grains disrupts the SI by preventing pollen tube inhibition. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model whereby the NaStEP and NaSIPP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion, in incompatible pollen tubes, might destabilize the mitochondria and contribute to arrest pollen tube growth.</p>

A coupled-clock system drives the automaticity of human sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells
<p>The spontaneous rhythmic action potentials generated by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker in the heart, dictate the regular and optimal cardiac contractions that pump blood around the body. Although the heart rate of humans is substantially slower than that of smaller experimental animals, current perspectives on the biophysical mechanisms underlying the automaticity of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells (SANCs) have been gleaned largely from studies of animal hearts. Using human SANCs, we demonstrated that spontaneous rhythmic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases generated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> clock were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed to electrogenic surface membrane molecules (the M clock) to trigger rhythmic action potentials, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup>–cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling regulated clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. When these clocks became un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed, SANCs failed to generate spontaneous action potentials, showing a depolarized membrane potential and disorganized local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases that failed to activate the M clock. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, which increases cAMP concentrations and clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing in other species, restored spontaneous, rhythmic action potentials in some nonbeating “arrested” human SANCs by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and synchronizing diastolic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases. When β-AR stimulation was withdrawn, the clocks again became un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed, and SANCs reverted to a nonbeating arrested state. Thus, automaticity of human pacemaker cells is driven by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed-clock system driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling. Extreme clock un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing led to failure of spontaneous action potential generation, which was restored by re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing of the clocks. Clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing and action potential firing in some of these arrested cells can be restored by β-AR stimulation–induced augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling.</p>

The DUF1669 domain of FAM83 family proteins anchor casein kinase 1 isoforms
<p>Members of the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of serine-threonine protein kinases are implicated in the regulation of many cellular processes, including the cell cycle, circadian rhythms, and Wnt and Hedgehog signaling. Because these kinases exhibit constitutive activity in biochemical assays, it is likely that their activity in cells is controlled by subcellular localization, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with inhibitory proteins, targeted degradation, or combinations of these mechanisms. We identified members of the FAM83 family of proteins as partners of CK1 in cells. All eight members of the FAM83 family (FAM83A to FAM83H) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the α and α-like isoforms of CK1; FAM83A, FAM83B, FAM83E, and FAM83H also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the δ and ε isoforms of CK1. We detected no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between any FAM83 member and the related CK1γ1, CK1γ2, and CK1γ3 isoforms. Each FAM83 protein exhibited a distinct pattern of subcellular distribution and colocalized with the CK1 isoform(s) to which it bound. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of FAM83 proteins with CK1 isoforms was mediated by the conserved domain of unknown function 1669 (DUF1669) that characterizes the FAM83 family. Mutations in FAM83 proteins that prevented them from binding to CK1 interfered with the proper subcellular localization and cellular functions of both the FAM83 proteins and their CK1 binding partners. On the basis of its function, we propose that DUF1669 be renamed the polypeptide anchor of CK1 domain.</p>

Global assessment of its network dynamics reveals that the kinase Plk1 inhibits the phosphatase PP6 to promote Aurora A activity
<p>Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an essential protein kinase that promotes faithful mitotic progression in eukaryotes. The subcellular localization and substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions of Plk1 are tightly controlled and require its binding to phosphorylated residues. To identify phosphorylation-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions within the Plk1 network in human mitotic cells, we performed quantitative proteomics on HeLa cells cultured with kinase inhibitors or expressing a Plk1 mutant that was deficient in phosphorylation-dependent substrate binding. We found that many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions were abolished upon kinase inhibition; however, a subset was protected from phosphatase opposition or was unopposed, resulting in persistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of the substrate with Plk1. This subset includes phosphoprotein phosphatase 6 (PP6), whose activity toward Aurora kinase A (Aurora A) was inhibited by Plk1. Our data suggest that this Plk1-PP6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion generates a feedback loop that coordinates and reinforces the activities of Plk1 and Aurora A during mitotic entry and is terminated by the degradation of Plk1 during mitotic exit. Thus, we have identified a mechanism for the previously puzzling observation of the Plk1-dependent regulation of Aurora A.</p>

Rapid change of superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling through critical doping in Bi-2212

Induction of CD4 T cell memory by local cellular collectivity

BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 Associates with Immune Receptors and Is Required for Immune Responses
<p>Plants utilize cell surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMP/DAMPs) and initiate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Here, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 (BSK5), a member of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily XII, in PRR-initiated immunity. BSK5 localized to the plant cell periphery, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed in yeast and in planta with multiple receptor-like kinases, including the ELONGATION FACTOR-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and PEP1 RECEPTOR1 (PEPR1) PRRs, and was phosphorylated in vitro by PEPR1 and EFR in the kinase activation loop. Consistent with a role in PTI, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants displayed enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and to the fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Furthermore, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants were impaired in several immune responses induced by the elf18, pep1, and flg22 PAMP/DAMPs, including resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>B. cinerea</i>, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition at the cell wall, and enhanced <i>PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1</i> gene expression. However, <i>bsk5</i> plants were not affected in PAMP/DAMP activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and expression of the <i>FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> or the WRKY domain-containing gene <i>WRKY29</i>. BSK5 variants mutated in the BSK5 myristoylation site, ATP-binding site, and kinase activation loop failed to complement defective PTI phenotypes of <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants, suggesting that localization to the cell periphery, kinase activity, and phosphorylation by PRRs are critical for the function of BSK5 in PTI. These findings demonstrate that BSK5 plays a role in PTI by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing with multiple immune receptors.</p>

In filamentous fungi, chromatin modifications regulate secondary metabolism. In this study we investigated how the absence of histone deacetylase HDA-2 in the <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> strain Δ<i>hda-2</i> impacts its effect on a host, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The production of VOCs and their impact on plant growth and development were assessed as well. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> strain was impaired in its ability to colonize Arabidopsis roots, thus affecting the promotion of plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of plant defenses against foliar pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, which normally result from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with <i>T. atroviride</i>. Furthermore, Δ<i>hda-2</i> VOCs were incapable of triggering plant defenses to counterattack foliar pathogens. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> overproduced the VOC 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP), which resulted in enhanced root branching and differentially regulated phytohormone-related genes. Analysis of ten VOCs (including 6-PP) revealed that three of them positively regulated plant growth, whereas six had the opposite effect. Assessment of secondary metabolites, detoxification, and communication with plant-related genes showed a dual role for HDA-2 in <i>T. atroviride</i> gene expression regulation during its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 on the promoters of plant-responsive genes in Δ<i>hda-2</i> showed, in the presence of Arabidopsis, low levels of <i>epl-1</i> and <i>abc-2</i> compared with that in the wild type; whereas <i>ctf-1</i> presented high constitutive levels, supporting a dual role of HDA-2 in gene regulation.

ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 Coordinates CONSTANS to Delay Flowering by Recruiting the Transcriptional Corepressor TPR2
<p>ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 (AFP2) negatively regulates the abscisic acid signal by accelerating ABI5 degradation during seed germination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The abscisic acid signal is reported to delay flowering by up-regulating <i>Flowering Locus C</i> expression, but the role of AFP2 in regulating flowering time is unknown. Here, we found that flowering time was markedly delayed and <i>CONSTANS</i> (<i>CO</i>) expression was reduced in a transgenic Arabidopsis line overexpressing <i>AFP2</i> under LD conditions. Conversely, the loss-of-function <i>afp2</i> mutant showed slightly earlier flowering, with higher <i>CO</i> expression. These data suggest that <i>AFP2</i> negatively regulates photoperiod-dependent flowering time by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ating the CO signal. We then found that <i>AFP2</i> exhibited circadian expression rhythms that peaked during the night. Furthermore, the C-terminus of AFP2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with CO, while its N-terminal ethylene response factor–associated amphiphilic repression motif <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the transcriptional corepressor TOPLESS-related protein2 (TPR2). Thus, AFP2 bridges CO and TPR2 to form the CO-AFP2-TPR2 complex. Biochemical and genetic analyses showed that AFP2 mediated CO degradation during the night. AFP2 also recruited histone deacetylase activity at <i>Flowering Locus T</i> chromatin through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with TPR2.

The Extra-Pathway Interactome of the TCA Cycle: Expected and Unexpected Metabolic Interactions
<p>The plant tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle provides essential precursors for respiration, amino acid biosynthesis, and general nitrogen metabolism; moreover, it is closely involved in biotic stress responses and cellular redox homeostasis. To further understand the in vivo function of the TCA cycle enzymes, we combined affinity purification with proteomics to generate a comprehensive extra-pathway protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network of the plant TCA cycle. We identified 125 extra-pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mostly related to the mitochondrial electron transport complex/ATP synthesis and amino acid metabolism but also to proteins associated with redox stress. We chose three high-scoring and two low-scoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions for complementary bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays, which highlighted the reliability of our approach, supported the intimate involvement of TCA cycle enzymes within many biological processes, and reflected metabolic changes reported previously for the corresponding mutant lines. To analyze the function of a subset of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, we selected two mutants of mitochondrial glutaredoxin S15 and Amidase, which have not yet been analyzed with respect to their TCA cycle function, and performed metabolite profiling and flux analysis. Consistent with their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions identified in this study, TCA cycle metabolites and the relative TCA flux of the two mutants were altered significantly.</p>

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with elongation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial gradients for elongation rate, osmotic pressure, cell wall thickness, and wall mechanical compliances and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the polysaccharide composition, mobility, hydration, and intermolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions of the inflorescence cell wall using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing. Force-extension curves revealed a gradient, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing curves showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal gradient in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

Acyl-CoA-Binding Protein ACBP1 Modulates Sterol Synthesis during Embryogenesis
<p>Fatty acids (FAs) and sterols are primary metabolites that exert interrelated functions as structural and signaling lipids. Despite their common syntheses from acetyl-coenzyme A, homeostatic cross talk remains enigmatic. Six Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) acyl-coenzyme A-binding proteins (ACBPs) are involved in FA metabolism. ACBP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>s with PHOSPHOLIPASE Dα1 and regulates phospholipid composition. Here, its specific role in the negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of sterol synthesis during embryogenesis is reported. ACBP1, likely in a liganded state, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>s with STEROL C4-METHYL OXIDASE1-1 (SMO1-1), a rate-limiting enzyme in the sterol pathway. Proembryo abortion in the double mutant indicated that the ACBP1-SMO1-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion is synthetic lethal, corroborating with their strong promoter activities in developing ovules. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed quantitative and compositional changes in FAs and sterols upon overexpression or mutation of <i>ACBP1</i> and/or <i>SMO1-1</i>. Aberrant levels of these metabolites may account for the downstream defect in lipid signaling. <i>GLABRA2</i> (<i>GL2</i>), encoding a phospholipid/sterol-binding homeodomain transcription factor, was up-regulated in developing seeds of <i>acbp1</i>, <i>smo1-1</i>, and <i>ACBP1</i>+/−<i>smo1-1</i> in comparison with the wild type. Consistent with the corresponding transcriptional alteration of GL2 targets, high-oil, low-mucilage phenotypes of <i>gl2</i> were phenocopied in <i>ACBP1</i>+/−<i>smo1-1</i>. Thus, ACBP1 appears to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ate the metabolism of two important lipid classes (FAs and sterols) influencing cellular signaling.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 protein of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein family, which also includes the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible proteins, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix proteins and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible proteins. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion, and integration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion analyses suggest the direct physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their protein products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Detailed Echocardiographic Phenotyping in Breast Cancer Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease in patients with breast cancer is of growing concern. The longitudinal effects of commonly used therapies, including doxorubicin and trastuzumab, on cardiac remodeling and function remain unknown in this population. We aimed to define the changes in echocardiographic parameters of structure, function, and ventricular-arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing, and their associations with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and heart failure symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a longitudinal prospective cohort study of 277 breast cancer participants receiving doxorubicin (Dox), trastuzumab (Tras), or both (Dox+Tras), we obtained 1249 echocardiograms over a median follow-up of 2.0 (interquartile range, 1.0–3.0) years. Left ventricular structure, diastolic and contractile function, and ventricular-arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing measures were quantified in a core laboratory blinded to participant characteristics. We evaluated changes in echocardiographic parameters over time, and used repeated-measures regression models to define their association with LVEF decline and recovery.

With Dox, there was a sustained, modest decrease in LVEF over the follow-up duration (1-year change in LVEF –3.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], –4.4% to –2.8%; 3-year change –3.8%; 95% CI, –5.1% to –2.5%). With Tras, a similar LVEF decline was observed at 1 year (–4.5%; 95% CI, –6.0% to –2.9%) and 3 years (–2.8%; 95%CI, –5.3 to –0.4%).

Gating of social reward by oxytocin in the ventral tegmental area
<p>The reward generated by social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions is critical for promoting prosocial behaviors. Here we present evidence that oxytocin (OXT) release in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key node of the brain’s reward circuitry, is necessary to elicit social reward. During social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, activity in paraventricular nucleus (PVN) OXT neurons increased. Direct activation of these neurons in the PVN or their terminals in the VTA enhanced prosocial behaviors. Conversely, inhibition of PVN OXT axon terminals in the VTA decreased social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. OXT increased excitatory drive onto reward-specific VTA dopamine (DA) neurons. These results demonstrate that OXT promotes prosocial behavior through direct effects on VTA DA neurons, thus providing mechanistic insight into how social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions can generate rewarding experiences.</p>

Characteristic signatures in energy and time, predicted by the standard model for this process, were observed in high signal-to-background conditions.

Higher predation risk for insect prey at low latitudes and elevations

We tested the hypothesis that biotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion strength increases toward the equator, using a global experiment with model caterpillars to measure predation risk. Across an 11,660-kilometer latitudinal gradient spanning six continents, we found increasing predation toward the equator, with a parallel pattern of increasing predation toward lower elevations. Patterns across both latitude and elevation were driven by arthropod predators, with no systematic trend in attack rates by birds or mammals. These matching gradients at global and regional scales suggest consistent drivers of biotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion strength, a finding that needs to be integrated into general theories of herbivory, community organization, and life-history evolution.</p>

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within communities can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> to organize their behavior. It has been unclear whether such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the behavior of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm communities undergoing metabolic oscillations can become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase oscillations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their behavior to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

RPA binds histone H3-H4 and functions in DNA replication–coupled nucleosome assembly
<p>DNA replication–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed nucleosome assembly is essential to maintain genome integrity and retain epigenetic information. Multiple involved histone chaperones have been identified, but how nucleosome assembly is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed to DNA replication remains elusive. Here we show that replication protein A (RPA), an essential replisome component that binds single-stranded DNA, has a role in replication-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed nucleosome assembly. RPA directly binds free H3-H4. Assays using a synthetic sequence that mimics freshly unwound single-stranded DNA at replication fork showed that RPA promotes DNA-(H3-H4) complex formation immediately adjacent to double-stranded DNA. Further, an RPA mutant defective in H3-H4 binding exhibited attenuated nucleosome assembly on nascent chromatin. Thus, we propose that RPA functions as a platform for targeting histone deposition to replication fork, through which RPA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>es nucleosome assembly with ongoing DNA replication.</p>

Mechanistic basis for a molecular triage reaction
<p>Newly synthesized proteins are triaged between biosynthesis and degradation to maintain cellular homeostasis, but the decision-making mechanisms are unclear.

Client-SGTA engagement of the targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e induces rapid, private, and committed client transfer to TRC40 for successful biosynthesis.

<i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> HtpG Interaction with nsLTP AsE246 Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation

The Role of Gβ Protein in Controlling Cell Expansion via Potential Interaction with Lipid Metabolic Pathways
<p>Heterotrimeric G-proteins influence almost all aspects of plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants, likely via their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with specific effectors. However, the identity of such effectors and their mechanism of action are mostly unknown. While investigating the roles of different G-protein subunits in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ating the oil content in Camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>), an oil seed crop, we uncovered a role of Gβ proteins in controlling anisotropic cell expansion. Knockdown of <i>Gβ</i> genes causes reduced longitudinal and enhanced transverse expansion, resulting in altered cell, tissue, and organ shapes in transgenic plants during vegetative and reproductive development. These plants also exhibited substantial changes in their fatty acid and phospholipid profiles, which possibly leads to the increased oil content of the transgenic seeds. This increase is potentially caused by the direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of Gβ proteins with a specific patatin-like phospholipase, pPLAIIIδ. Camelina plants with suppressed <i>Gβ</i> expression exhibit higher lipase activity, and show phenotypes similar to plants overexpressing <i>pPLAIIIδ</i>, suggesting that the Gβ proteins are negative regulators of pPLAIIIδ. These results reveal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions between the G-protein–mediated and lipid signaling/metabolic pathways, where specific phospholipases may act as effectors that control key developmental and environmental responses of plants.</p>

Analysis of single recessive mutations in <i>rel2</i> revealed an array of vegetative and reproductive phenotypes, many related to defects in meristem initiation and maintenance. To better understand how REL2-mediated transcriptional complexes relate to <i>rel2</i> phenotypes, we performed protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion assays and transcriptional profiling of mutant inflorescences, leading to the identification of different maize transcription factors and regulatory pathways that employ REL2 repression to control traits directly impacting maize yields. In addition, we used our REL2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion data to catalog conserved repression motifs present on REL2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ors and showed that two of these, RLFGV- and DLN-type motifs, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with the C-terminal WD40 domain of REL2 rather than the N terminus, which is known to bind LxLxL EAR motifs.

Membrane depolarization activates BK channels through ROCK-mediated β1 subunit surface trafficking to limit vasoconstriction
<p>Membrane depolarization of smooth muscle cells (myocytes) in the small arteries that regulate regional organ blood flow leads to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion. Membrane depolarization also activates large-conductance calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)–activated potassium (BK) channels, which limits Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion, thus leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasodil</span></strong>ation. We showed that in human and rat arterial myocytes, membrane depolarization rapidly increased the cell surface abundance of auxiliary BK β1 subunits but not that of the pore-forming BKα channels. Membrane depolarization stimulated voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the activation of Rho kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2. ROCK1/2-mediated activation of Rab11A promoted the delivery of β1 subunits to the plasma membrane by Rab11A-positive recycling endosomes. These additional β1 subunits associated with BKα channels already at the plasma membrane, leading to an increase in apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and activation of the channels in pressurized arterial myocytes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasodil</span></strong>ation. Thus, membrane depolarization activates BK channels through stimulation of ROCK- and Rab11A-dependent trafficking of β1 subunits to the surface of arterial myocytes.</p>

PIEZOs mediate neuronal sensing of blood pressure and the baroreceptor reflex
<p>Activation of stretch-sensitive baroreceptor neurons exerts acute control over heart rate and blood pressure. Although this homeostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> has been described for more than 80 years, the molecular identity of baroreceptor mechanosensitivity remains unknown. We discovered that mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are together required for baroreception. Genetic ablation of both <i>Piezo1</i> and <i>Piezo2</i> in the nodose and petrosal sensory ganglia of mice abolished drug-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> and aortic depressor nerve activity. Awake, behaving animals that lack <i>Piezos</i> had labile hypertension and increased blood pressure variability, consistent with phenotypes in baroreceptor-denervated animals and humans with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> failure. Optogenetic activation of <i>Piezo2</i>-positive sensory afferents was sufficient to initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> in mice. These findings suggest that PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are the long-sought baroreceptor mechanosensors critical for acute blood pressure control.</p>

RSK2 contributes to myogenic vasoconstriction of resistance arteries by activating smooth muscle myosin and the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger
<p>Smooth muscle contraction is triggered when Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylates the regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC<sub>20</sub>). However, blood vessels from <i>Mlck</i>-deficient mouse embryos retain the ability to contract, suggesting the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms. We showed that the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) also phosphorylated RLC<sub>20</sub> to promote smooth muscle contractility. Active, phosphorylated RSK2 was present in mouse resistance arteries under normal basal tone, and phosphorylation of RSK2 increased with myogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion or agonist stimulation. Resistance arteries from <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice were dilated and showed reduced myogenic tone and RLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation. RSK2 phosphorylated Ser<sup>19</sup> in RLC in vitro. In addition, RSK2 phosphorylated an activating site in the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (NHE-1), resulting in cytosolic alkalinization and an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion. NHE-1 activity increased upon myogenic constriction, and the increase in intracellular pH was suppressed in <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice. In pressured arteries, RSK2-dependent activation of NHE-1 was associated with increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which would be expected to increase MLCK activity, thereby contributing to basal tone and myogenic responses. Accordingly, <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice had lower blood pressure than normal littermates. Thus, RSK2 mediates a procontractile signaling pathway that contributes to the regulation of basal vascular tone, myogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion, and blood pressure and may be a potential therapeutic target in smooth muscle contractility disorders.</p>

Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation by PKA stimulates the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and vasoconstriction during acute hyperglycemia and diabetes
<p>Hypercontractility of arterial myocytes and enhanced vascular tone during diabetes are, in part, attributed to the effects of increased glucose (hyperglycemia) on L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. In murine arterial myocytes, kinase-dependent mechanisms mediate the increase in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity in response to increased extracellular glucose. We identified a subpopulation of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel pore-forming subunit (α1<sub>C</sub>) within nanometer proximity of protein kinase A (PKA) at the sarcolemma of murine and human arterial myocytes. This arrangement depended upon scaffolding of PKA by an A-kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150) in mice. Glucose-mediated increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activity were associated with PKA activity, leading to α1<sub>C</sub> phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1928</sup>. Compared to arteries from low-fat diet (LFD)–fed mice and nondiabetic patients, arteries from high-fat diet (HFD)–fed mice and from diabetic patients had increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity. Arterial myocytes and arteries from mice lacking AKAP150 or expressing mutant AKAP150 unable to bind PKA did not exhibit increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current density in response to increased glucose or to HFD. Consistent with a functional role for Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, arterial myocytes and arteries from knockin mice expressing a Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 with Ser<sup>1928</sup> mutated to alanine (S1928A) lacked glucose-mediated increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion. Furthermore, the HFD-induced increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current density and myogenic tone were prevented in S1928A knockin mice. These findings reveal an essential role for α1<sub>C</sub> phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1928</sup> in stimulating Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion by AKAP-targeted PKA upon exposure to increased glucose and in diabetes.</p>

Nitrite and <i>S</i>-Nitrosohemoglobin Exchange Across the Human Cerebral and Femoral Circulation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying red blood cell (RBC)–mediated hypoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasodil</span></strong>ation remain controversial, with separate roles for nitrite ([Formula]) and <i>S</i>-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb) widely contested given their ability to transduce nitric oxide bioactivity within the microcirculation. To establish their relative contribution in vivo, we quantified arterial-venous concentration gradients across the human cerebral and femoral circulation at rest and during exercise, an ideal model system characterized by physiological extremes of O<sub>2</sub> tension and blood flow.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Ten healthy participants (5 men, 5 women) aged 24±4 (mean±SD) years old were randomly assigned to a normoxic (21% O<sub>2</sub>) and hypoxic (10% O<sub>2</sub>) trial with measurements performed at rest and after 30 minutes of cycling at 70% of maximal power output in hypoxia and equivalent relative and absolute intensities in normoxia. Blood was sampled simultaneously from the brachial artery and internal jugular and femoral veins with plasma and RBC nitric oxide metabolites measured by tri-iodide reductive chemiluminescence. Blood flow was determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (cerebral blood flow) and constant infusion thermodilution (femoral blood flow) with net exchange calculated via the Fick principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Hypoxia was associated with a mild increase in both cerebral blood flow and femoral blood flow (<i>P</i><0.05 versus normoxia) with further, more pronounced increases observed in femoral blood flow during exercise (<i>P</i><0.05 versus rest) in proportion to the reduction in RBC oxygenation (<i>r</i>=0.680–0.769, <i>P</i><0.001). Plasma [Formula] gradients reflecting consumption (arterial>venous; <i>P</i><0.05) were accompanied by RBC iron nitrosylhemoglobin formation (venous>arterial; <i>P</i><0.05) at rest in normoxia, during hypoxia (<i>P</i><0.05 versus normoxia), and especially during exercise (<i>P</i><0.05 versus rest), with the most pronounced gradients observed across the bioenergetically more active, hypoxemic, and acidotic femoral circulation (<i>P</i><0.05 versus cerebral). In contrast, we failed to observe any gradients consistent with RBC SNO-Hb consumption and corresponding delivery of plasma <i>S</i>-nitrosothiols (<i>P</i>>0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings suggest that hypoxia and, to a far greater extent, exercise independently promote arterial-venous delivery gradients of intravascular nitric oxide, with deoxyhemoglobin-mediated [Formula] reduction identified as the dominant mechanism underlying hypoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasodil</span></strong>ation.</p></sec>

Fire Simulation and Cardiovascular Health in Firefighters

After each exposure, ex vivo thrombus formation, fibrinolysis, platelet activation, and forearm blood flow in response to intra-arterial infusions of endothelial-dependent and -independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasodil</span></strong>ators were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After fire simulation training, core temperature increased (1.0±0.1°C) and weight reduced (0.46±0.14 kg, <i>P</i><0.001 for both). In comparison with control, exposure to fire simulation increased thrombus formation under low-shear (73±14%) and high-shear (66±14%) conditions (<i>P</i><0.001 for both) and increased platelet-monocyte binding (7±10%, <i>P</i>=0.03).

The LKB1–AMPK-α1 signaling pathway triggers hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction downstream of mitochondria
<p>Hypoxic pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion (HPV), which aids ventilation-perfusion matching in the lungs, is triggered by mechanisms intrinsic to pulmonary arterial smooth muscles. The unique sensitivity of these muscles to hypoxia is conferred by mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 2, the inhibition of which has been proposed to trigger HPV through increased generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Contrary to this model, we have shown that the LKB1–AMPK-α1 signaling pathway is critical to HPV. Spectral Doppler ultrasound revealed that deletion of the AMPK-α1 catalytic subunit blocked HPV in mice during mild (8% O<sub>2</sub>) and severe (5% O<sub>2</sub>) hypoxia, whereas AMPK-α2 deletion attenuated HPV only during severe hypoxia. By contrast, neither of these genetic manipulations affected serotonin-induced reductions in pulmonary vascular flow. HPV was also attenuated by reduced expression of LKB1, a kinase that activates AMPK during energy stress, but not after deletion of CaMKK2, a kinase that activates AMPK in response to increases in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Fluorescence imaging of acutely isolated pulmonary arterial myocytes revealed that AMPK-α1 or AMPK-α2 deletion did not affect mitochondrial membrane potential during normoxia or hypoxia. However, deletion of AMPK-α1, but not of AMPK-α2, blocked hypoxia from inhibiting K<sub>V</sub>1.5, the classical “oxygen-sensing” K<sup>+</sup> channel in pulmonary arterial myocytes. We conclude that LKB1–AMPK-α1 signaling pathways downstream of mitochondria are critical for the induction of HPV, in a manner also supported by AMPK-α2 during severe hypoxia.</p>

Voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into smooth muscle during contraction promotes endothelium-mediated feedback vasodilation in arterioles
<p>Vascular smooth muscle contraction is suppressed by feedback dilation mediated by the endothelium. In skeletal muscle arterioles, this feedback can be activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals passing from smooth muscle through gap junctions to endothelial cells, which protrude through holes in the internal elastic lamina to make contact with vascular smooth muscle cells. Although hypothetically either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) may provide the intercellular signal, it is generally thought that IP<sub>3</sub> diffusion is responsible. We provide evidence that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCCs) in vascular smooth muscle can pass to the endothelium through positions aligned with holes in the internal elastic lamina in amounts sufficient to activate endothelial cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. In endothelial cells in which IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs) were blocked, VDCC-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were transient and localized to the endothelium that protrudes through the internal elastic lamina to contact vascular smooth muscle cells. In endothelial cells in which IP<sub>3</sub>Rs were not blocked, VDCC-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in endothelial cells were amplified to form propagating waves. These waves activated voltage-insensitive, intermediate-conductance, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (IK<sub>Ca</sub>) channels, thereby providing feedback that effectively suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion and enabled cycles of constriction and dilation called vasomotion. Thus, agonists that stimulate vascular smooth muscle depolarization provide Ca<sup>2+</sup> to endothelial cells to activate a feedback circuit that protects tissue blood flow.</p>

Choline acetyltransferase–expressing T cells are required to control chronic viral infection
<p>Although widely studied as a neurotransmitter, T cell–derived acetylcholine (ACh) has recently been reported to play an important role in regulating immunity. However, the role of lymphocyte-derived ACh in viral infection is unknown. Here, we show that the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of ACh production, is robustly induced in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in an IL-21–dependent manner. Deletion of <i>Chat</i> within the T cell compartment in mice ablated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasodil</span></strong>ation in response to infection, impaired the migration of antiviral T cells into infected tissues, and ultimately compromised the control of chronic LCMV clone 13 infection. Our results reveal a genetic proof of function for ChAT in T cells during viral infection and identify a pathway of T cell migration that sustains antiviral immunity.</p>

Mental Stress–Induced-Myocardial Ischemia in Young Patients With Recent Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received <sup>99m</sup>Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22–61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22% versus 11%, <i>P</i>=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, <i>P</i>=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women’s proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.</p></sec>

Pharmacodynamic Effects of Switching From Ticagrelor to Clopidogrel in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Switching between different classes of P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, including de-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel, commonly occurs in clinical practice. However, the pharmacodynamic profiles of this strategy have been poorly explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, open-label study conducted in patients on maintenance dosing (MD) of aspirin (81 mg/d) and clopidogrel (75 mg/d). After a 7-day run-in with ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose [LD] followed by 90 mg twice daily MD), patients (n=80) were randomized into 1 of 4 groups: group A, clopidogrel 600 mg LD 24 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-600 mg-24h); group B, clopidogrel 600 mg LD 12 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-600 mg-12h); group C, clopidogrel 75 mg/d MD 24 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-75 mg-24h); and group D, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily MD (T-90 mg twice daily). MD of the randomized treatment was maintained for 10±3 days. Pharmacodynamic assessments were performed at baseline, after run-in, and at 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours and 10 days with P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction units by VerifyNow; platelet reactivity index was assessed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasodil</span></strong>ator-stimulated phosphoprotein; and maximal platelet aggregation was determined by light transmittance aggregometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>T-90 mg twice daily led to lower platelet reactivity than any clopidogrel regimen using all assays at all time points. P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction unit levels were similar between the C-600 mg-24h (group A) and the C-75 mg-24h (group C) (<i>P</i>=0.29), including at 48 hours (primary end point; least mean difference, −6.9; 95% confidence interval, −38.1 to 24.3; <i>P</i>=0.66). P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction unit levels were lower with C-600 mg-12h (group B) than with C-75 mg-24h (group C; <i>P</i>=0.024). Maximal platelet aggregation over time was lower with both C-600 mg-24h (group A; <i>P</i>=0.041) and C-600 mg-12h (group B; <i>P</i>=0.028) compared with C-75 mg-24h (group C). Platelet reactivity index profiles paralleled those observed with P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction units. There were no pharmacodynamic differences for all tests between C-600 mg-24h (group A) and C-600 mg-12h (group B). In group C (C-75 mg-24h), platelet reactivity increased compared with baseline as early as 24 hours, reaching statistical significance at 48 and 72 hours and up to 10 days. These pharmacodynamic findings were delayed and blunted in magnitude with the administration of an LD, regardless of the timing of administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>De-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel therapy is associated with an increase in platelet reactivity. The use of an LD before the initiation of an MD regimen of clopidogrel mitigates these observations, although this is not affected by the timing of its administration after ticagrelor discontinuation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

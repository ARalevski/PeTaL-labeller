Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s cooperatively emit photons. Demonstrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of controlled collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s has resulted from the ability to directly imprint correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> superradiance: Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with predefined correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s). Enhanced collective photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> number was less than unity. The correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> among single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s was achieved by nanometer-precis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> control and phase-aligned state manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s by using a nanohole-array aperture. Our results demonstrate a platform for phase-controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other mon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Hyperfine interaction of individual atoms on a surface
<p>Taking advantage of nuclear spins for electronic structure analysis, magnetic resonance imaging, and quantum devices hinges on knowledge and control of the surrounding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic-scale environment. We measured and manipulated the hyperfine interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of individual iron and titanium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s placed on a magnesium oxide surface by using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy in combinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> electron spin resonance. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to move single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, we found that the hyperfine interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> strongly depended on the binding configurat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>. We could extract <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>- and posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-dependent informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> about the electronic ground state, the state mixing with neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, and properties of the nuclear spin. Thus, the hyperfine spectrum becomes a powerful probe of the chemical environment of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and nanostructures.</p>

Large-amplitude transfer motion of hydrated excess protons mapped by ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy
<p>Solvat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and transport of excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s in aqueous systems play a fundamental role in acid-base chemistry and biochemical processes. We mapped ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> excurs<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfer coordinate by means of two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al infrared spectroscopy, both in bulk water and in a Zundel cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup> motif selectively prepared in acetonitrile. Electric fields from the environment and stochastic hydrogen bond mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s induce fluctuat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> double-minimum potential. Within the lifetime of a particular hydrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> geometry, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> explores a multitude of posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s on a sub-100-femtosecond time scale.

Creation of a Bose-condensed gas of <sup>87</sup>Rb by laser cooling
<p>Protocols for attaining quantum degeneracy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic gases almost exclusively rely on evaporative cooling, a time-consuming final step associated with substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. We demonstrate direct laser cooling of a gas of rubidium-87 (<sup>87</sup>Rb) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s to quantum degeneracy. The method is fast and induces little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s are trapped in a two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al optical lattice that enables cycles of compress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to increase the density, followed by Raman sideband cooling to decrease the temperature. From a starting number of 2000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, 1400 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s reach quantum degeneracy in 300 milliseconds, as confirmed by a bimodal velocity distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The method should be broadly applicable to many bosonic and ferm<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic species and to systems where evaporative cooling is not possible.</p>

Atom-by-atom assembly of defect-free one-dimensional cold atom arrays
<p>The realizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of large-scale fully controllable quantum systems is an exciting frontier in modern physical science. We use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> assembly to implement a platform for the deterministic preparat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of regular one-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al arrays of individually controlled cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. In our approach, a measurement and feedback procedure eliminates the entropy associated with probabilistic trap occupat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and results in defect-free arrays of more than 50 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in less than 400 milliseconds. The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers, which we use to arrange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in desired geometric patterns and to maintain these configurat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s by replacing lost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with surplus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s from a reservoir. This bottom-up approach may enable controlled engineering of scalable many-body systems for quantum informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> processing, quantum simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, and precis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> measurements.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolyte with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents.

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s approaching the size of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and water molecules. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic plane from a bulk crystal. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, molecular separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair. The dynamic, reversible format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multinuclear sites from mobilized single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s represents a distinct phenomenon that falls outside the convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al boundaries of a heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst.</p>

Synthesis of FeH<sub>5</sub>: A layered structure with atomic hydrogen slabs
<p>High pressure promotes the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of polyhydrides with unusually high hydrogen-to-metal ratios.

We synthesized iron pentahydride (FeH<sub>5</sub>) by a direct react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between iron and H<sub>2</sub> above 130 gigapascals in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. FeH<sub>5</sub> exhibits a structure built of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic hydrogen only. It consists of intercalated layers of quasicubic FeH<sub>3</sub> units and four-plane slabs of thin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic hydrogen. The distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valenc</span></strong>e electron density indicates a bonding between hydrogen and iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s but none between hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, presenting a two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al metallic character.

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters
<p>Cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> (NHX-type) antiporters are important regulators of intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and are critical for cell expans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and plant stress acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and pH homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth phenotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar pH and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles. These results highlight the importance of NHX-type cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the maintenance of cellular cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and in growth and development.</p>

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

<p>It has long been an aspirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al goal to create artificial structures that allow fast permeat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of water but reject even the smallest hydrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, replicating the feat achieved by nature in protein channels (e.g., aquaporins). Despite recent progress in creating nanoscale pores and capillaries, these structures still remain distinctly larger than protein channels. We report capillaries made by effectively extracting one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic plane from bulk crystals, which leaves a two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al slit of a few angstroms in height. Water moves through these capillaries with little resistance, whereas no permeat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> could be detected even for such small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s as Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>. Only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s (H<sup>+</sup>) can diffuse through monolayer water inside the capillaries. These observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s improve our understanding of molecular transport at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic scale.</p>

The Rydberg constant and proton size from atomic hydrogen
<p>At the core of the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> radius puzzle” is a four–standard deviat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> discrepancy between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> root-mean-square charge radii (<i>r</i><sub>p</sub>) determined from the regular hydrogen (H) and the muonic hydrogen (µp) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. Using a cryogenic beam of H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, we measured the 2S-4P transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> frequency in H, yielding the values of the Rydberg constant <i>R</i><sub>∞</sub> = 10973731.568076(96) per meter<sup></sup>and <i>r</i><sub>p</sub> = 0.8335(95) femtometer. Our <i>r</i><sub>p</sub> value is 3.3 combined standard deviat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s smaller than the previous H world data, but in good agreement with the µp value. We motivate an asymmetric fit funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, which eliminates line shifts from quantum interference of neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic resonances.</p>

Quantized thermal transport in single-atom junctions
<p>Thermal transport in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic junct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and chains is of great fundamental interest because of the distinctive quantum effects expected to arise in them. By using novel, custom-fabricated, picowatt-resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> calorimetric scanning probes, we measured the thermal conductance of gold and platinum metallic wires down to single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> junct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Our work reveals that the thermal conductance of gold single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> junct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s is quantized at room temperature and shows that the Wiedemann-Franz law relating thermal and electrical conductance is satisfied even in single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> contacts. Furthermore, we quantitatively explain our experimental results within the Landauer framework for quantum thermal transport. The experimental techniques reported here will enable thermal transport studies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic and molecular chains, which will be key to investigating numerous fundamental issues that thus far have remained experimentally inaccessible.</p>

An atom-by-atom assembler of defect-free arbitrary two-dimensional atomic arrays
<p>Large arrays of individually controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s trapped in optical tweezers are a very promising platform for quantum engineering applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. However, deterministic loading of the traps is experimentally challenging. We demonstrate the preparat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of fully loaded two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al arrays of up to ~50 microtraps, each containing a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> and arranged in arbitrary geometries. Starting from initially larger, half-filled matrices of randomly loaded traps, we obtain user-defined target arrays at unit filling. This is achieved with a real-time control system and a moving optical tweezers, which together enable a sequence of rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> moves depending on the initial distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in the arrays.

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration
<p>Nanoporous two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al materials are attractive for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic and molecular nanofiltrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> but limited by insufficient mechanical strength over large areas. We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water molecules while blocking solute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s or molecules to enable size-selective separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The SWNT network physically separates the GNM into microsized islands and acts as the microscopic framework to support the GNM, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin GNM. The resulting GNM/SWNT membranes show high water permeance and a high reject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> ratio for salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s or organic molecules, and they retain stable separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> performance in tubular modules.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma

Atomic model for the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> region of mitochondrial ATP synthase
<p>Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase produces the majority of ATP in eukaryotic cells, and its dimerizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is necessary to create the inner membrane folds, or cristae, characteristic of mitochondria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> translocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> through the membrane-embedded F<sub>O</sub> reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> turns the rotor that drives ATP synthesis in the soluble F<sub>1</sub> reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Although crystal structures of the F<sub>1</sub> reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> have illustrated how this rotat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> leads to ATP synthesis, understanding how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> translocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> produces the rotat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> has been impeded by the lack of an experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic model for the F<sub>O</sub> reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

Angular momentum–induced delays in solid-state photoemission enhanced by intra-atomic interactions
<p>Attosecond time-resolved photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy reveals that photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from solids is not yet fully understood. The relative emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> delays between four photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels measured for the van der Waals crystal tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) can only be explained by accounting for both propagat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic delays. The intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic delay depends on the angular momentum of the initial localized state and is determined by intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. For the studied case of WSe<sub>2</sub>, the photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> events are time ordered with rising initial-state angular momentum. Including intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic electron-electron interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and angular momentum of the initial localized state yields excellent agreement between theory and experiment. This has required a revis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of existing models for solid-state photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and thus, attosecond time-resolved photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from solids provides important benchmarks for improved future photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> models.</p>

Femtosecond x-ray spectroscopy of an electrocyclic ring-opening reaction
<p>The ultrafast light-activated electrocyclic ring-opening react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a fundamental prototype of photochemical pericyclic react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Generally, these react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are thought to proceed through an intermediate excited-state minimum (the so-called pericyclic minimum), which leads to isomerizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> via nonadiabatic relaxat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to the ground state of the photoproduct. Here, we used femtosecond (fs) soft x-ray spectroscopy near the carbon K-edge (~284 electron volts) on a table-top apparatus to directly reveal the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valenc</span></strong>e electronic structure of this transient intermediate state. The core-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valenc</span></strong>e spectroscopic signature of the pericyclic minimum observed in the experiment was characterized, in combinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with time-dependent density funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al theory calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, to reveal overlap and mixing of the frontier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valenc</span></strong>e orbital energy levels.

Single-molecule optomechanics in “picocavities”
<p>Trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> limit and can confine light to volumes typically on the order of 30 cubic nanometers. We found that individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features inside the gap of a plasmonic nanoassembly can localize light to volumes well below 1 cubic nanometer (“picocavities”), enabling optical experiments on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic scale. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features are dynamically formed and disassembled by laser irradiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Although unstable at room temperature, picocavities can be stabilized at cryogenic temperatures, allowing single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic cavities to be probed for many minutes. Unlike tradit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al optomechanical resonators, such extreme optical confinement yields a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> enhancement of optomechanical coupling between the picocavity field and vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of individual molecular bonds.

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Orientation-dependent stereo Wigner time delay and electron localization in a small molecule
<p>Attosecond metrology of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s has accessed the time scale of the most fundamental processes in quantum mechanics.

Here we show that orientat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>- and energy-resolved measurements characterize the molecular stereo Wigner time delay. This observable provides direct informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> on the localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the excited electron wave packet within the molecular potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that photoelectrons resulting from the dissociative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> process of the CO molecule are preferentially emitted from the carbon end for dissociative <sup>2</sup>Σ states and from the center and oxygen end for the <sup>2</sup>Π states of the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures
<p>Magnetic multilayer devices that exploit magnetoresistance are the backbone of magnetic sensing and data storage technologies.

We demonstrate tunneling magnetoresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for magnetic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures.

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms

Energy powerhouses of cells come into focus
<p>In every kingdom of life, rotary adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthases and adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) play key roles in cellular energy generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and release processes. In mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria, F-type (F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>) ATP synthases synthesize ATP using energy from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> gradient. They are also able to perform the reverse process, generating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> gradients by ATP hydrolysis. The related V-type (V<sub>1</sub>V<sub>o</sub>) ATPases have similar structures and serve as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> pumps. Two articles in this issue report structures of membrane-embedded ATP synthases from yeast mitochondria [Srivastava <i>et al.</i>, page 619, (<i>1</i>)] and spinach chloroplasts [Hahn <i>et al.</i>, page 620, (<i>2</i>)]. Together with other recent structures, these articles define core design principles of rotary ATP synthases and ATPases but also highlight organism-specific differences.</p>

Toward an optically controlled brain
<p>Neurons can be modified with light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels, which cause them to become excited upon illuminat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). This discovery has given rise to the field of optogenetics, with impressive examples such as triggering the beat of a heart with light (<i>3</i>). There is, however, one technical limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>: Light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels are typically stimulated with blue-green light, which is heavily scattered by tissue. Thus, deep brain stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, focused on small reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, is a major challenge. On page 679 of this issue, Chen <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) use transgenic mice implanted with upconverting nanoparticles (NPs) to locally activate light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels and modulate neuronal activity, even deep inside the brain. This method might eventually lead the way for clinical applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to optically control neuronal dysfunct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, such as Parkinson's disease or even paralysis.</p>

Signatures of exciton condensation in a transition metal dichalcogenide
<p>Bose condensat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> has shaped our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic gases, and liquid helium. Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to condense into either a superfluid or an insulating electronic crystal. Using the recently developed technique of momentum‐resolved electron energy‐loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied electronic collective modes in the transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1<i>T</i>‐TiSe<sub>2</sub>. Near the phase-transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the electronic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and crystallizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valenc</span></strong>e electrons into an exciton condensate. Our study provides compelling evidence for exciton condensat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in a three-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al solid and establishes M-EELS as a versatile technique sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valenc</span></strong>e band excitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in quantum materials.</p>

Double-trap measurement of the proton magnetic moment at 0.3 parts per billion precision
<p>Precise knowledge of the fundamental properties of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> is essential for our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic structure as well as for precise tests of fundamental symmetries. We report on a direct high-precis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> measurement of the magnetic moment μ<sub>p</sub> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> in units of the nuclear magneton μ<sub>N</sub>. The result, μ<sub>p</sub> = 2.79284734462 (±0.00000000082) μ<sub>N</sub>, has a fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al precis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of 0.3 parts per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, improves the previous best measurement by a factor of 11, and is consistent with the currently accepted value. This was achieved with the use of an optimized double–Penning trap technique. Provided a similar measurement of the anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> magnetic moment can be performed, this result will enable a test of the fundamental symmetry between matter and antimatter in the baryonic sector at the 10<sup>−10</sup> level.</p>

A Fermi-degenerate three-dimensional optical lattice clock
<p>Strontium optical lattice clocks have the potential to simultaneously interrogate mill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with a high spectroscopic quality factor of 4 × 10<sup>17</sup>. Previously, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s have forced a compromise between clock stability, which benefits from a large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, and accuracy, which suffers from density-dependent frequency shifts. Here we demonstrate a scalable solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that takes advantage of the high, correlated density of a degenerate Fermi gas in a three-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al (3D) optical lattice to guard against on-site interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> shifts. We show that contact interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are resolved so that their contribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to clock shifts is orders of magnitude lower than in previous experiments. A synchronous clock comparison between two reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the 3D lattice yields a measurement precis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of 5 × 10<sup>–19</sup> in 1 hour of averaging time.</p>

Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments on lens tissue show colloidal gels of S-crystallins at all radial posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Sparse lens materials form via low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valenc</span></strong>e linkages between disordered loops protruding from the protein surface.

Iodide management in formamidinium-lead-halide–based perovskite layers for efficient solar cells

Arylation of hydrocarbons enabled by organosilicon reagents and weakly coordinating anions

Although these examples have inspired several theoretical and mechanistic studies, aryl cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> equivalents have received limited attent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in organic methodology. Their high-energy, promiscuous reactivity profiles have hampered applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in selective intermolecular processes. We report a react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> design that overcomes these challenges. Specifically, we found that β-silicon–stabilized aryl cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> equivalents, generated via silylium-mediated fluoride activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, undergo insert<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> into sp<sup>3</sup> and sp<sup>2</sup> C–H bonds. This react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> manifold provides a framework for the catalytic arylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of hydrocarbons, including simple alkanes such as methane. This process uses low loadings of Earth-abundant initiators (1 to 5 mole percent) and occurs under mild condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (30° to 100°C).</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing metallic hydrogen has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. Metallic hydrogen may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, hydrogen becomes metallic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic density. The properties are those of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic metal. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington dissociative transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic metallic hydrogen in the laboratory.</p>

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom
<p>Integrated nonreciprocal optical components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, are key for routing signals in photonic circuits. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum optical circulator operated by a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> controls the operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level.

Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of its operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al states and may become a key element for quantum informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> processing in scalable integrated optical circuits.</p>

Spectroscopic snapshots of the proton-transfer mechanism in water
<p>The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> mobility in water as a sequence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfers along a hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) network.

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements

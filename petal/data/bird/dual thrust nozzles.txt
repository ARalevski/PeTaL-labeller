Phosphorylation of SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE by the MPK3/6 Kinase Is Required for Anther Development
<p>Germ cells are indispensable carriers of genetic information from one generation to the next. In contrast to the well-understood process in animals, information on the mechanism of germ cell initiation in plants is very limited. <i>SPOROCYTELESS</i>/<i>NOZZLE</i> was previously identified as an essential regulator of diploid germ cell (archesporial cell) differentiation in the stamens and ovules of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Although <i>SPOROCYTELESS</i> (<i>SPL</i>) transcription is activated by the floral organ identity regulator AGAMOUS and epigenetically regulated by SET DOMAIN GROUP2, little is known about the regulation of the SPL protein. Here, we report that the protein kinases MPK3 and MPK6 can both interact with SPL in vitro and in vivo and can phosphorylate the SPL protein in vitro. In addition, phosphorylation of the SPL protein by MPK3/6 is required for SPL function in the Arabidopsis anther, as measured by its effect on archesporial cell differentiation. We further demonstrate that phosphorylation enhances SPL protein stability. This work not only uncovers the importance of SPL phosphorylation for its regulatory role in Arabidopsis anther development, but also supports the hypothesis that the regulation of precise spatiotemporal patterning of germ cell initiation and that differentiation is achieved progressively through multiple levels of regulation, including transcriptional and posttranslational modification.</p>

Large Numbers of Novel miRNAs Originate from DNA Transposons and Are Coincident with a Large Species Radiation in Bats
<p>Vesper bats (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a rapid adaptive radiation beginning around 36 Ma that resulted in the second most species-rich mammalian family (>400 species). Coincident with that radiation was an initial burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present in some species. Such extensive and recent DNA transposon activity has not been seen in any other extant mammal. Indeed, retrotransposon activity is much more common in all other sequenced mammal genomes. Deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction from a vespertilionid bat, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, as well as a dog and horse revealed large numbers of 17â€“24 bp putative miRNAs (p/miRNAs). Although the origination rate of p/miRNAs is similar in all three taxa, 61.1% of postdivergence p/miRNAs in <i>Eptesicus</i> are derived from transposable elements (TEs) compared with only 23.9% and 16.5% in the dog and horse, respectively. Not surprisingly, given the retrotransposon bias of dog and horse, the majority of TE-derived p/miRNAs are associated with retrotransposons. In <i>Eptesicus</i>, however, 58.7% of the TE-derived and 35.9% of the total p/miRNAs arose not from retrotransposons but from bat-specific DNA transposons. Notably, we observe that the timing of the DNA transposon expansion and the resulting introduction of novel p/miRNAs coincide with the rapid diversification of the family Vespertilionidae. Furthermore, potential targets of the DNA transposon-derived p/miRNAs are identifiable and enriched for genes that are important for regulation of transcription. We propose that lineage-specific DNA transposon activity lead to the rapid and repeated introduction of novel p/miRNAs. Some of these p/miRNAs are likely functional miRNAs and potentially influenced the diversification of Vespertilionidae. Our observations suggest a mechanism for introducing functional genomic variation rapidly through the expansion of DNA transposons that fits within the TE-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrust</span></strong> hypothesis.</p>

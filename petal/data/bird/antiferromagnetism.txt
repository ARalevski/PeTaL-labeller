Control and local measurement of the spin chemical potential in a magnetic insulator
<p>The spin chemical potential characterizes the tendency of spins to diffuse. Probing this quantity could provide insight into materials such as magnetic insulators and spin liquids and aid optimization of spintronic devices. Here we introduce single-spin magnetometry as a generic platform for nonperturbative, nanoscale characterization of spin chemical potentials. We experimentally realize this platform using diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers and use it to investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnon</span></strong>s in a magnetic insulator, finding that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnon</span></strong> chemical potential can be controlled by driving the system’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic resonance. We introduce a symmetry-based two-fluid theory describing the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnon</span></strong> processes, measure the local thermo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnon</span></strong>ic torque, and illustrate the detection sensitivity using electrically controlled spin injection. Our results pave the way for nanoscale control and imaging of spin transport in mesoscopic systems.</p>

All-oxide–based synthetic antiferromagnets exhibiting layer-resolved magnetization reversal
<p>Synthesizing anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>s with correlated oxides has been challenging, owing partly to the markedly degraded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ism of the magnetic layer at nanoscale thicknesses. Here we report on the engineering of an anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic interlayer exchange coupling (AF-IEC) between ultrathin but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic La<sub>2/3</sub>Ca<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> layers across an insulating CaRu<sub>1/2</sub>Ti<sub>1/2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> spacer. The layer-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic switch</span></strong>ing leads to sharp steplike <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hysteresi</span></strong>s loops with magnetization plateaus depending on the repetition number of the stacking bilayers. The magnetization configurations can be switched at moderate fields of hundreds of oersted. Moreover, the AF-IEC can also be realized with an alternative magnetic layer of La<sub>2/3</sub>Sr<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> that possesses a Curie temperature near room temperature. The findings will add functionalities to devices with correlated-oxide interfaces.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D materials at the nanoscale with single-spin microscopy
<p>The discovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals has generated widespread interest. Making further progress in this area requires quantitative knowledge of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic properti</span></strong>es of vdW magnets at the nanoscale. We used scanning single-spin magnetometry based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers to image the magnetization, localized defects, and magnetic domains of atomically thin crystals of the vdW magnet chromium(III) iodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>). We determined the magnetization of CrI<sub>3</sub> monolayers to be ≈16 Bohr magnetons per square nanometer, with comparable values in samples with odd numbers of layers; however, the magnetization vanishes when the number of layers is even. We also found that structural modifications can induce switching between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic interlayer ordering. These results demonstrate the benefit of using single-spin scanning magnetometry to study the magnetism of 2D vdW magnets.</p>

Electrical generation and detection of spin waves in a quantum Hall ferromagnet
<p>Spin waves are collective excitations of magnetic systems. An attractive setting for studying long-lived spin-wave physics is the quantum Hall (QH) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>, which forms spontaneously in clean two-dimensional electron systems at low temperature and in a perpendicular magnetic field. We used out-of-equilibrium occupation of QH edge channels in graphene to excite and detect spin waves in magnetically ordered QH states. Our experiments provide direct evidence for long-distance spin-wave propagation through different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic phases in the <i>N</i> = 0 Landau level, as well as across the insulating canted anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic phase. Our results will enable experimental investigation of the fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic properti</span></strong>es of these exotic two-dimensional electron systems.</p>

Observation of Dicke cooperativity in magnetic interactions
<p>The interaction of <i>N</i> two-level atoms with a single-mode light field is an extensively studied many-body problem in quantum optics, first analyzed by Dicke in the context of superradiance. A characteristic of such systems is the cooperative enhancement of the coupling strength by a factor of [Formula]. In this study, we extended this cooperatively enhanced coupling to a solid-state system, demonstrating that it also occurs in a magnetic solid in the form of matter-matter interaction. Specifically, the exchange interaction of <i>N</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paramagnet</span></strong>ic erbium(III) (Er<sup>3+</sup>) spins with an iron(III) (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnon</span></strong> field in erbium orthoferrite (ErFeO<sub>3</sub>) exhibits a vacuum Rabi splitting whose magnitude is proportional to [Formula]. Our results provide a route for understanding, controlling, and predicting novel phases of condensed matter using concepts and tools available in quantum optics.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D van der Waals crystalline insulators via electron tunneling
<p>Magnetic insulators are a key resource for next-generation spintronic and topological devices. The family of layered metal halides promises varied magnetic states, including ultrathin insulating multiferroics, spin liquids, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>s, but device-oriented characterization methods are needed to unlock their potential. Here, we report tunneling through the layered magnetic insulator CrI<sub>3</sub> as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. We electrically detect the magnetic ground state and interlayer coupling and observe a field-induced metamagnetic transition. The metamagnetic transition results in magnetoresistances of 95, 300, and 550% for bilayer, trilayer, and tetralayer CrI<sub>3</sub> barriers, respectively. We further measure inelastic tunneling spectra for our junctions, unveiling a rich spectrum consistent with collective magnetic excitations (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnon</span></strong>s) in CrI<sub>3</sub>.</p>

Two-dimensional sp<sup>2</sup> carbon–conjugated covalent organic frameworks
<p>We synthesized a two-dimensional (2D) crystalline covalent organic framework (sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF) that was designed to be fully π-conjugated and constructed from all sp<sup>2</sup> carbons by C=C condensation reactions of tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene and 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile. The C=C linkages topologically connect pyrene knots at regular intervals into a 2D lattice with π conjugations extended along both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions and develop an eclipsed layer framework rather than the more conventionally obtained disordered structures. The sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF is a semiconductor with a discrete band gap of 1.9 electron volts and can be chemically oxidized to enhance conductivity by 12 orders of magnitude. The generated radicals are confined on the pyrene knots, enabling the formation of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paramagnet</span></strong>ic carbon structure with high spin density. The sp<sup>2</sup> carbon framework induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic phase transition to develop spin-spin coherence and align spins unidirectionally across the material.</p>

Temporal and spatial patterns of internal and external stem CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in a sub-Mediterranean oak
<p>To accurately estimate stem respiration (<i>R</i><sub>S</sub>), measurements of both carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) efflux to the atmosphere (<i>E</i><sub>A</sub>) and internal CO<sub>2</sub> flux through xylem (<i>F</i><sub>T</sub>) are needed because xylem sap transports respired CO<sub>2</sub> upward. However, reports of seasonal dynamics of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> are scarce and no studies exist in Mediterranean species under drought stress conditions. Internal and external CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes at three stem heights, together with radial stem growth, temperature, sap flow and shoot water potential, were measured in <i>Quercus pyrenaica</i> Willd. in four measurement campaigns during one growing season. Substantial daytime depressions in temperature-normalized <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> were observed throughout the experiment, including prior to budburst, indicating that diel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hysteresi</span></strong>s between stem temperature and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> cannot be uniquely ascribed to diversion of CO<sub>2</sub> in the transpiration stream. Low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] (<0.5%) resulted in low contributions of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> throughout the growing season, and <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> was mainly explained by <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> (>90%). Internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] was found to vary vertically along the stems. Seasonality in resistance to radial CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion was related to shoot water potential. The low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] and <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> observed in our study may result from the downregulation of xylem respiration in response to a legacy of coppicing as well as high radial diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> through cambium, phloem and bark tissues, which was related to low water content of stems. Long-term studies analyzing temporal and spatial variation in internal and external CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and their interactions are needed to mechanistically understand and model respiration of woody tissues.</p>

Particulate methane monooxygenase contains only mononuclear copper centers
<p>Bacteria that oxidize methane to methanol are central to mitigating emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The nature of the copper active site in the primary metabolic enzyme of these bacteria, particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), has been controversial owing to seemingly contradictory biochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic results. We present biochemical and electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paramagnet</span></strong>ic resonance spectroscopic characterization most consistent with two monocopper sites within pMMO: one in the soluble PmoB subunit at the previously assigned active site (Cu<sub>B</sub>) and one ~2 nanometers away in the membrane-bound PmoC subunit (Cu<sub>C</sub>). On the basis of these results, we propose that a monocopper site is able to catalyze methane oxidation in pMMO.</p>

Phase transitions in a programmable quantum spin glass simulator
<p>Understanding magnetic phases in quantum mechanical systems is one of the essential goals in condensed matter physics, and the advent of prototype quantum simulation hardware has provided new tools for experimentally probing such systems. We report on the experimental realization of a quantum simulation of interacting Ising spins on three-dimensional cubic lattices up to dimensions 8 × 8 × 8 on a D-Wave processor (D-Wave Systems, Burnaby, Canada). The ability to control and read out the state of individual spins provides direct access to several order parameters, which we used to determine the lattice’s magnetic phases as well as critical disorder and one of its universal exponents. By tuning the degree of disorder and effective transverse magnetic field, we observed phase transitions between a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paramagnet</span></strong>ic, an anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic, and a spin-glass phase.</p>

Chiromagnetic nanoparticles and gels
<p>Chiral inorganic nanostructures have high circular dichroism, but real-time control of their optical activity has so far been achieved only by irreversible chemical changes. Field modulation is a far more desirable path to chiroptical devices. We hypothesized that magnetic field modulation can be attained for chiral nanostructures with large contributions of the magnetic transition dipole moments to polarization rotation. We found that dispersions and gels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paramagnet</span></strong>ic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with chiral distortions of the crystal lattices exhibited chiroptical activity in the visible range that was 10 times as strong as that of non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paramagnet</span></strong>ic nanoparticles of comparable size. Transparency of the nanoparticle gels to circularly polarized light beams in the ultraviolet range was reversibly modulated by magnetic fields. These phenomena were also observed for other nanoscale metal oxides with lattice distortions from imprinted amino acids and other chiral ligands. The large family of chiral ceramic nanostructures and gels can be pivotal for new technologies and knowledge at the nexus of chirality and magnetism.</p>

Tough adhesives for diverse wet surfaces
<p>Adhesion to wet and dynamic surfaces, including biological tissues, is important in many fields but has proven to be extremely challenging. Existing adhesives are cytotoxic, adhere weakly to tissues, or cannot be used in wet environments. We report a bioinspired design for adhesives consisting of two layers: an adhesive surface and a dissipative matrix. The former adheres to the substrate by electrostatic interactions, covalent bonds, and physical interpenetration. The latter amplifies energy dissipation through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hysteresi</span></strong>s. The two layers synergistically lead to higher adhesion energies on wet surfaces as compared with those of existing adhesives. Adhesion occurs within minutes, independent of blood exposure and compatible with in vivo dynamic movements. This family of adhesives may be useful in many areas of application, including tissue adhesives, wound dressings, and tissue repair.</p>

Volcanic tremor and plume height hysteresis from Pavlof Volcano, Alaska
<p>The March 2016 eruption of Pavlof Volcano, Alaska, produced an ash plume that caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights in North America. The eruption generated strong tremor that was recorded by seismic and remote low-frequency acoustic (infrasound) stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array. The relationship between the tremor amplitudes and plume height changes considerably between the waxing and waning portions of the eruption. Similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hysteresi</span></strong>s has been observed between seismic river noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and erosional processes in both rivers and volcanoes can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in geophysical data. We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the tremor source related to volcanic vent erosion. This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity.</p>

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The dynamics of many-body systems spanning condensed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase transitions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose condensates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives condensates across an effectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the condensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this compound in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidation. Both compounds preserved linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of lipids, carnosic acid was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical quencher of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paramagnet</span></strong>ic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 extracted from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of grasses, but its specific binding target is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 binding to sequentially extracted maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily binds glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix polysaccharide in grass CWs. This binding is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 binding, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paramagnet</span></strong>ic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By mixing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were observed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially binds GAX. In contrast, no PRE was observed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the rigid fraction of GAX became more rigid upon EXPB1 binding while the dynamic fraction became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens grass CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which binds cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s target in grass CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand binding for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

Antifreeze proteins in the primary urine of larvae of the beetle <i>Dendroides canadensis</i>
<p>To avoid freezing while overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, <i>Dendroides canadensis</i> (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) larvae produce a family of antifreeze proteins (DAFPs) that are transcribed in specific tissues and have specific compartmental fates. DAFPs and associated thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hysteresi</span></strong>s activity (THA) have been shown previously in hemolymph and midgut fluid, but the presence of DAFPs has not been explored in primary urine, a potentially important site that can contain endogenous ice-nucleating compounds that could induce freezing. A maximum mean THA of 2.65±0.33°C was observed in primary urine of winter-collected <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae. THA in primary urine increased significantly through autumn, peaked in the winter and decreased through spring to levels of 0.2–0.3°C in summer, in a pattern similar to that of hemolymph and midgut fluid. THA was also found in hindgut fluid and excreted rectal fluid, suggesting that these larvae not only concentrate AFPs in the hindgut, but also excrete AFPs from the rectal cavity. Based on <i>dafp</i> transcripts isolated from Malpighian tubule epithelia, cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, identifying the presence of transcripts encoding 24 DAFP isoforms. Six of these Malpighian tubule DAFPs were known previously, but 18 are new. We also provide functional evidence that DAFPs can inhibit ice nucleators present in insect primary urine. This is potentially critical because <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae die if frozen, and therefore ice formation in any body fluid, including the urine, would be lethal.</p>

Polarity compensation mechanisms on the perovskite surface KTaO<sub>3</sub>(001)
<p>The stacking of alternating charged planes in ionic crystals creates a diverging electrostatic energy—a “polar catastrophe”—that must be compensated at the surface. We used scanning probe microscopies and density functional theory to study compensation mechanisms at the perovskite potassium tantalate<i> </i>(KTaO<sub>3</sub>) (001) surface as increasing degrees of freedom were enabled. The as-cleaved surface in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> is frozen in place but immediately responds with an insulator-to-metal transition and possibly ferroelectric lattice distortions. Annealing in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> allows the formation of isolated oxygen vacancies, followed by a complete rearrangement of the top layers into an ordered pattern of KO and TaO<sub>2</sub> stripes. The optimal solution is found after exposure to water vapor through the formation of a hydroxylated overlayer with ideal geometry and charge.</p>

Magneto-Seebeck tunneling on the atomic scale
<p>The tunneling of spin-polarized electrons across a magnetic tunnel junction driven by a temperature gradient is a fundamental process for the thermal control of electron spin transport. We experimentally investigated the atomic-scale details of this magneto-Seebeck tunneling by placing a magnetic probe tip in close proximity to a magnetic sample at cryogenic temperature, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> as the tunneling barrier. Heating the tip and measuring the thermopower of the junction while scanning across the spin texture of the sample lead to spin-resolved Seebeck coefficients that can be mapped at atomic-scale lateral resolution. We propose a spin detector for spintronics applications that is driven solely by waste heat, using magneto-Seebeck tunneling to convert spin information into a voltage that can be used for further data processing.</p>

Double-negative-index ceramic aerogels for thermal superinsulation
<p>Ceramic aerogels are attractive for thermal insulation but plagued by poor mechanical stability and degradation under thermal shock. In this study, we designed and synthesized hyperbolic architectured ceramic aerogels with nanolayered double-pane walls with a negative Poisson’s ratio (−0.25) and a negative linear thermal expansion coefficient (−1.8 × 10<sup>−6</sup> per °C). Our aerogels display robust mechanical and thermal stability and feature ultralow densities down to ~0.1 milligram per cubic centimeter, superelasticity up to 95%, and near-zero strength loss after sharp thermal shocks (275°C per second) or intense thermal stress at 1400°C, as well as ultralow thermal conductivity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> [~2.4 milliwatts per meter-kelvin (mW/m·K)] and in air (~20 mW/m·K). This robust material system is ideal for thermal superinsulation under extreme conditions, such as those encountered by spacecraft.</p>

U.N. HIV/AIDS agency assailed for culture of harassment
<p>An independent panel that evaluated sexual harassment, bullying, and abuses of power at the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) issued a blistering report that called for a change in leadership to address what it called a "<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> of accountability." UNAIDS, based in Geneva, Switzerland, is the global command center in the fight against HIV/AIDS, issuing authoritative epidemiological updates and staging campaigns to improve prevention and treatment—and, ironically, to promote human rights. But the panel report says there's a "boy's club" culture at UNAIDS, and it strongly faults the executive director, Michel Sidibé, for fostering a patriarchal environment that is marred further by nepotism and retaliation against employees who complain. Sidibé requested that the panel convene after two staffers were accused of sexual harassment and there was criticism of his handling of the incidents. The Programme Coordinating Board that oversees UNAIDS is meeting this week and reviewing the panel's recommendations.</p>

Observation of Dicke cooperativity in magnetic interactions
<p>The interaction of <i>N</i> two-level atoms with a single-mode light field is an extensively studied many-body problem in quantum optics, first analyzed by Dicke in the context of superradiance. A characteristic of such systems is the cooperative enhancement of the coupling strength by a factor of [Formula]. In this study, we extended this cooperatively enhanced coupling to a solid-state system, demonstrating that it also occurs in a magnetic solid in the form of matter-matter interaction. Specifically, the exchange interaction of <i>N</i> paramagnetic erbium(III) (Er<sup>3+</sup>) spins with an iron(III) (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) magnon field in erbium orthoferrite (ErFeO<sub>3</sub>) exhibits a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> Rabi splitting whose magnitude is proportional to [Formula]. Our results provide a route for understanding, controlling, and predicting novel phases of condensed matter using concepts and tools available in quantum optics.</p>

Maxima in the thermodynamic response and correlation functions of deeply supercooled water
<p>Femtosecond x-ray laser pulses were used to probe micrometer-sized water droplets that were cooled down to 227 kelvin in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong>. Isothermal compressibility and correlation length were extracted from x-ray scattering at the low–momentum transfer region. The temperature dependence of these thermodynamic response and correlation functions shows maxima at 229 kelvin for water and 233 kelvin for heavy water. In addition, we observed that the liquids undergo the fastest growth of tetrahedral structures at similar temperatures. These observations point to the existence of a Widom line, defined as the locus of maximum correlation length emanating from a critical point at positive pressures in the deeply supercooled regime. The difference in the maximum value of the isothermal compressibility between the two isotopes shows the importance of nuclear quantum effects.</p>

Full momentum- and energy-resolved spectral function of a 2D electronic system
<p>The single-particle spectral function measures the density of electronic states in a material as a function of both momentum and energy, providing central insights into strongly correlated electron phenomena. Here we demonstrate a high-resolution method for measuring the full momentum- and energy-resolved electronic spectral function of a two-dimensional (2D) electronic system embedded in a semiconductor. The technique remains operational in the presence of large externally applied magnetic fields and functions even for electronic systems with zero electrical conductivity or with zero electron density. Using the technique on a prototypical 2D system, a GaAs quantum well, we uncover signatures of many-body effects involving electron-phonon interactions, plasmons, polarons, and a phonon analog of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> Rabi splitting in atomic systems.</p>

Strong coupling of a single electron in silicon to a microwave photon
<p>Silicon is vital to the computing industry because of the high quality of its native oxide and well-established doping technologies. Isotopic purification has enabled quantum coherence times on the order of seconds, thereby placing silicon at the forefront of efforts to create a solid-state quantum processor. We demonstrate strong coupling of a single electron in a silicon double quantum dot to the photonic field of a microwave cavity, as shown by the observation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> Rabi splitting. Strong coupling of a quantum dot electron to a cavity photon would allow for long-range qubit coupling and the long-range entanglement of electrons in semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Simple Method for Measuring Apoplast Hydration and Collecting Apoplast Contents
<p>The plant leaf apoplast is a dynamic environment subject to a variety of both internal and external stimuli. In addition to being a conduit for water vapor and gas exchange involved in transpiration and photosynthesis, the apoplast also accumulates many nutrients transported from the soil as well as those produced through photosynthesis. The internal leaf also provides a protective environment for endophytic and pathogenic microbes alike. Given the diverse array of physiological processes occurring in the apoplast, it is expedient to develop methods to study its contents. Many established methods rely on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> infiltration of an apoplast wash solution followed by centrifugation. In this study, we describe a refined method optimized for maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seedling leaves, which not only provides a simple procedure for obtaining apoplast fluid, but also allows direct calculation of apoplast hydration at the time of harvest for every sample. In addition, we describe an abbreviated method for estimating apoplast hydration if the full apoplast extraction is not necessary. Finally, we show the applicability of this optimized apoplast extraction procedure for plants infected with the maize pathogen <i>Pantoea stewartii</i> ssp <i>stewartii</i>, including the efficient isolation of bacteria previously residing in the apoplast. The approaches to establishing this method should make it generally applicable to other types of plants.</p>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision   arthroplasty surgery. Proprietary cement preparations containing   vancomycin are available, but are significantly more expensive.   We investigated whether the elution of antibiotic from ‘home-made’   cement containing vancomycin was comparable with more expensive   commercially available vancomycin impregnated cement.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 18 cement discs containing either proprietary CopalG+V;   or ‘home-made’ CopalR+G with vancomycin added by hand, were made.   Each disc contained the same amount of antibiotic (0.5 g gentamycin,   2 g vancomycin) and was immersed in ammonium acetate buffer in a   sealed container. Fluid from each container was sampled at eight   time points over a two-week period. The concentrations of gentamicin   and vancomycin in the fluid were analysed using high performance   liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The highest peak concentrations of antibiotic were observed from   the ‘home-made’ cements containing vancomycin, added as in the operating   theatre. The overall elution of antibiotic was, fivefold (vancomycin)   and twofold (gentamicin) greater from the ‘home-made’ mix compared   with the commercially mixed cement. The use of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> during mixing   had no significant effect on antibiotic elution in any of the samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that the addition of 2 g vancomycin powder   to gentamicin-impregnated bone cement by hand significantly increases   the elution of both antibiotics compared with commercially prepared   cements containing vancomycin. We found no significant advantages   of using expensive commercially produced vancomycin-impregnated cement   and recommend the addition of vancomycin powder by hand in the operating theatre.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:73–7.</p></sec>

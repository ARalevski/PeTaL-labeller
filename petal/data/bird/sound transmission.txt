Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and water use efficiencies. To improve water use efficiency, mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance, water use efficiency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance and water use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing water use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance.</p>

Beyond Porosity: 3D Leaf Intercellular Airspace Traits That Impact Mesophyll Conductance
<p>The leaf intercellular airspace (IAS) is generally considered to have high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion relative to the liquid phase. While previous studies accounted for leaf-level variation in porosity and mesophyll thickness, they omitted 3D IAS traits that potentially influence IAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (g<sub>IAS</sub>). Here, we reevaluated the standard equation for g<sub>IAS</sub> by incorporating tortuosity, lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong> lengthening, and IAS connectivity. We measured and spatially mapped these geometric IAS traits for 19 Bromeliaceae species with Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) or C3 photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ways using x-ray microcomputed tomography imaging and a novel computational approach. We found substantial variation in porosity (0.04–0.73 m<sup>3</sup> m<sup>−3</sup>), tortuosity (1.09–3.33 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>), lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong> lengthening (1.12–3.19 m m<sup>−1</sup>), and IAS connectivity (0.81–0.97 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>) across all bromeliad leaves. The revised g<sub>IAS</sub> model predicted significantly lower g<sub>IAS</sub> in CAM (0.01–0.19 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) than in C3 (0.41–2.38 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) plants due to a coordinated decline in these IAS traits. Our reevaluated equation also generally predicted lower g<sub>IAS</sub> values than the former one. Moreover, we observed high spatial heterogeneity in these IAS geometric traits throughout the mesophyll, especially within CAM leaves. Our data show that IAS traits that better capture the 3D complexity of leaves strongly influence g<sub>IAS</sub> and that the impact of the IAS on mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance should be carefully considered with respect to leaf anatomy. We provide a simple function to estimate tortuosity and lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong> lengthening in the absence of access to imaging tools such as x-ray microcomputed tomography or other novel 3D image-processing techniques.</p>

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% loss of stem hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% loss of hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (change in percentage loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its hydraulic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong> problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>s through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong> while opening a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong> in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>s through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong> but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

Genomic and epidemiological monitoring of yellow fever virus transmission potential
<p>The yellow fever virus (YFV) epidemic in Brazil is the largest in decades. The recent discovery of YFV in Brazilian <i>Aedes</i> species mosquitos highlights a need to monitor the risk of reestablishment of urban YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in the Americas. We use a suite of epidemiological, spatial, and genomic approaches to characterize YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. We show that the age and sex distribution of human cases is characteristic of sylvatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Analysis of YFV cases combined with genomes generated locally reveals an early phase of sylvatic YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and spatial expansion toward previously YFV-free areas, followed by a rise in viral spillover to humans in late 2016. Our results establish a framework for monitoring YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in real time that will contribute to a global strategy to eliminate future YFV epidemics.</p>

Experimental observation of high thermal conductivity in boron arsenide
<p>Improving the thermal management of small-scale devices requires developing materials with high thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivities. The semi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>or boron arsenide (BAs) is an attractive target because of ab initio calculation indicating that single crystals have an ultrahigh thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity. We synthesized BAs single crystals without detectable defects and measured a room-temperature thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity of 1300 watts per meter-kelvin. Our spectroscopy study, in conjunction with atomistic theory, reveals that the distinctive band structure of BAs allows for very long phonon mean free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>s and strong high-order anharmonicity through the four-phonon process. The single-crystal BAs has better thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity than other metals and semi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ors. Our study establishes BAs as a benchmark material for thermal management applications and exemplifies the power of combining experiments and ab initio theory in new materials discovery.</p>

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The influence of the dynamics of leaf hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) diurnally and during dehydration on stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance and photosynthesis remains unclear. Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during dehydration; (2) its basis in the hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its dynamics on irradiance; (4) its impact on diurnal patterns of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas exchange and survival under simulated drought regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong vulnerability to dehydration diurnally in both gas exchange and hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced sensitivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to dehydration. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher irradiance in well-hydrated leaves across the full range of water potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> vulnerability was observed. Modeling indicated that responses to dehydration and irradiance are likely attributable to changes in membrane permeability and that a dynamic <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> would contribute strongly to stomatal closure, improving performance, survival, and efficient water use during drought. These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in hydraulic traits and their influence on gas exchange during dehydration.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both intestinal water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased activity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion increased neuronal excitability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic excitability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance SK-type and large-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic excitability, reduced GABAergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased activity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF exposure. Activating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA activity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic excitability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated disorders.</p>

Unusual high thermal conductivity in boron arsenide bulk crystals
<p>Conventional theory predicts that ultrahigh lattice thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity can only occur in crystals composed of strongly bonded light elements, and that it is limited by anharmonic three-phonon processes. We report experimental evidence that departs from these long-held criteria. We measured a local room-temperature thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity exceeding 1000 watts per meter-kelvin and an average bulk value reaching 900 watts per meter-kelvin in bulk boron arsenide (BAs) crystals, where boron and arsenic are light and heavy elements, respectively. The high values are consistent with a proposal for phonon-band engineering and can only be explained by higher-order phonon processes. These findings yield insight into the physics of heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ion in solids and show BAs to be the only known semi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>or with ultrahigh thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity.</p>

The thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity of BAs, 1000 ± 90 watts per meter per kelvin meter-kelvin, is higher than that of silicon carbide by a factor of 3 and is surpassed only by diamond and the basal-plane value of graphite.

Reactivation of recall-induced neurons contributes to remote fear memory attenuation
<p>Whether fear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation is mediated by inhibition of the original memory trace of fear with a new memory trace of safety or by updating of the original fear trace toward safety has been a long-standing question in neuroscience and psychology alike.

We found—chemogenetically and in an engram-specific manner—that effective remote fear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation is accompanied by the reactivation of memory recall–induced neurons in the dentate gyrus and that the continued activity of these neurons is critical for fear reduction.

A <i>LIMA1</i> variant promotes low plasma LDL cholesterol and decreases intestinal cholesterol absorption

Similar to the human phenotype, <i>Lima1</i>-deficient mice displayed reduced cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion and were resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Through our study of both mice and humans, we identify LIMA1 as a key protein regulating intestinal cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion.</p>

A nonconjugated radical polymer glass with high electrical conductivity

Anomalously low electronic thermal conductivity in metallic vanadium dioxide

We report an order-of-magnitude breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law at high temperatures ranging from 240 to 340 kelvin in metallic vanadium dioxide in the vicinity of its metal-insulator transition. Different from previously established mechanisms, the unusually low electronic thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity is a signature of the absence of quasiparticles in a strongly correlated electron fluid where heat and charge diffuse independently.</p>

The Potato MAP3K StVIK Is Required for the <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> RXLR Effector Pi17316 to Promote Disease
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ogens deliver effectors to manipulate processes in their hosts, creating a suitable environment for invasion and proliferation. Yet, little is known about the host proteins that are targeted by effectors from filamentous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ogens. Here, we show that stable transgenic expression in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) and transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> of the arginine-any amino acid-leucine-arginine effector Pi17316 enhances leaf colonization by the late blight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>. Expression of Pi17316 also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ates cell death triggered by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ogen-associated molecular pattern Infestin1 (INF1), indicating that the effector suppresses pattern-triggered immunity. However, this effector does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ate cell death triggered by a range of resistance proteins, showing that it specifically suppresses INF1-triggered cell death (ICD). In yeast two-hybrid assays, Pi17316 interacts directly with the potato ortholog of VASCULAR HIGHWAY1-interacting kinase (StVIK), encoding a predicted MEK kinase (MAP3K). Interaction in planta was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and occurs at the plant plasma membrane. Virus-induced gene silencing of <i>VIK</i> in <i>N. benthamiana</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated <i>P. infestans</i> colonization, whereas transient overexpression of <i>StVIK</i> enhanced colonization, indicating that this host protein acts as a susceptibility factor. Moreover, <i>VIK</i> overexpression specifically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated ICD, indicating that it is a negative regulator of immunity. The abilities of Pi17316 to enhance <i>P. infestans</i> colonization or suppress ICD were compromised significantly in <i>NbVIK</i>-silenced plants, demonstrating that the effector activity of Pi17316 is mediated by this MAP3K. Thus, StVIK is exploited by <i>P. infestans</i> as a susceptibility factor to promote late blight disease.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Osmotic and hydraulic adjustment of mangrove saplings to extreme salinity
<p>Salinity tolerance in plant species varies widely due to adaptation and acclimation processes at the cellular and whole-plant scales. In mangroves, extreme substrate salinity induces hydraulic failure and ion excess toxicity and reduces growth and survival, thus suggesting a potentially critical role for physiological acclimation to salinity. We tested the hypothesis that osmotic adjustment, a key type of plasticity that mitigates salinity shock, would take place in coordination with declines in whole-plant hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance in a common garden experiment using saplings of three mangrove species with different salinity tolerances (<i>Avicennia germinans</i> L., <i>Rhizophora mangle</i> L. and <i>Laguncularia racemosa</i> (L.) C.F. Gaertn., ordered from higher to lower salinity tolerance). For each mangrove species, four salinity treatments (1, 10, 30 and 50 practical salinity units) were established and the time trajectories were determined for leaf osmotic potential (Ψ<sub>s</sub>), stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), whole-plant hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (<i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>) and predawn disequilibrium between xylem and substrate water potentials (Ψ<sub>pdd</sub>). We expected that, for all three species, salinity increments would result in coordinated declines in Ψ<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, and that the Ψ<sub>pdd</sub> would increase with substrate salinity and time of exposure. In concordance with our predictions, reductions in substrate water potential promoted a coordinated decline in Ψ<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, whereas the Ψ<sub>pdd</sub> increased substantially during the first 4 days but dissipated after 7 days, indicating a time lag for equilibration after a change in substratum salinity. Our results show that mangroves confront and partially ameliorate acute salinity stress via simultaneous reductions in Ψ<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, thus developing synergistic physiological responses at the cell and whole-plant scales.</p>

Size-dependent enhancement of water relations during post-fire resprouting
<p>In resprouting species, fire-induced topkill causes a reduction in height and leaf area without a comparable reduction in the size of the root system, which should lead to an increase in the efficiency of water transport after fire. However, large plants undergo a greater relative reduction in size, compared with small plants, so we hypothesized that this enhancement in hydraulic efficiency would be greatest among large growth forms. In the ecotone between long-leaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i> Mill.) savannas and wetlands, we measured stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), mid-day leaf water potential (<i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>), leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (<i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>), leaf area and height of 10 species covering a range of growth forms in burned and unburned sites. As predicted, <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was higher in post-fire resprouts than in unburned plants, and the post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was positively related to plant size. Specifically, large-statured species tended to undergo the greatest relative reductions in leaf area and height, and correspondingly experienced the greatest increases in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>. The post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was smaller than expected, however, due to a decrease in absolute root hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (i.e., not scaled to leaf area). The higher <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> in burned sites was manifested as an increase in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> rather than an increase in <i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>. Post-fire increases in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> should promote high rates of photosynthesis for recovery of carbohydrate reserves and aboveground biomass, which is particularly important for large-statured species that require more time to recover their pre-fire size.</p>

Atomically dispersed Fe<sup>3+</sup> sites catalyze efficient CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction to CO

Operando x-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion spectroscopy revealed the active sites to be discrete Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions, coordinated to pyrrolic nitrogen (N) atoms of the N-doped carbon support, that maintain their +3 oxidation state during electrocatalysis, probably through electronic coupling to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ive carbon support.

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet
<p>Stellar heating causes atmospheres of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape.

We report the detection of the near-infrared triplet of neutral helium in the transiting warm Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-11b by using ground-based, high-resolution observations. The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion depth of 1.08 ± 0.05%. Interpreting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion spectra with three-dimensional simulations of the planet’s upper atmosphere suggests that it extends beyond 5 planetary radii, with a large-scale height and a helium mass loss rate of ≲3 × 10<sup>5</sup> grams per second.

Social network plasticity decreases disease transmission in a eusocial insect

By incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, we generated a hyper–interferon-sensitive (HIS) virus as a vaccine candidate. HIS virus is highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses, elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges.

Spindle asymmetry drives non-Mendelian chromosome segregation
<p>Genetic elements compete for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion through meiosis, when haploid gametes are created from a diploid parent. Selfish elements can enhance their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion through a process known as meiotic drive. In female meiosis, selfish elements drive by preferentially attaching to the egg side of the spindle. This implies some asymmetry between the two sides of the spindle, but the molecular mechanisms underlying spindle asymmetry are unknown. Here we found that CDC42 signaling from the cell cortex regulated microtubule tyrosination to induce spindle asymmetry and that non-Mendelian segregation depended on this asymmetry. Cortical CDC42 depends on polarization directed by chromosomes, which are positioned near the cortex to allow the asymmetric cell division. Thus, selfish meiotic drivers exploit the asymmetry inherent in female meiosis to bias their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion.</p>

Acoustic mirrors as sensory traps for bats
<p>Sensory traps pose a considerable and often fatal risk for animals, leading them to misinterpret their environment. Bats predominantly rely on their echolocation system to forage, orientate, and navigate. We found that bats can mistake smooth, vertical surfaces as clear flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>s, repeatedly colliding with them, likely as a result of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic mirror properties. The probability of collision is influenced by the number of echolocation calls and by the amount of time spent in front of the surface. The echolocation call analysis corroborates that bats perceive smooth, vertical surfaces as open flyways. Reporting on occurrences with different species in the wild, we argue that it is necessary to more closely monitor potentially dangerous locations with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic mirror properties (such as glass fronts) to assess the true frequency of fatalities around these sensory traps.</p>

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally transmitted Zika virus has been documented in the United States this year, a reflection of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with efforts to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid spread of the virus through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population immune. This so-called "herd immunity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika virus to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a vaccine against Zika, which caused widespread alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain deformities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the virus while they were pregnant. But with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in the region becoming scarce, it does complicate efforts of clinical trials that hope to show lower rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and disease in vaccinated people.

Restoring auditory cortex plasticity in adult mice by restricting thalamic adenosine signaling
<p>Circuits in the auditory cortex are highly susceptible to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic influences during an early postnatal critical period. The auditory cortex selectively expands neural representations of enriched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic stimuli, a process important for human language acquisition. Adults lack this plasticity. Here we show in the murine auditory cortex that juvenile plasticity can be reestablished in adulthood if <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic stimuli are paired with disruption of ecto-5′-nucleotidase–dependent adenosine production or A<sub>1</sub>–adenosine receptor signaling in the auditory thalamus. This plasticity occurs at the level of cortical maps and individual neurons in the auditory cortex of awake adult mice and is associated with long-term improvement of tone-discrimination abilities. We conclude that, in adult mice, disrupting adenosine signaling in the thalamus rejuvenates plasticity in the auditory cortex and improves auditory perception.</p>

We detected prominent H<sub>2</sub>O <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion bands with a maximum base-to-peak amplitude of 525 parts per million in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion spectrum. Using the water abundance as a proxy for metallicity, we measured HAT-P-26b’s atmospheric heavy element content ([Formula] times solar). This likely indicates that HAT-P-26b’s atmosphere is primordial and obtained its gaseous envelope late in its disk lifetime, with little contamination from metal-rich planetesimals.</p>

Quantized thermal transport in single-atom junctions
<p>Thermal transport in individual atomic junctions and chains is of great fundamental interest because of the distinctive quantum effects expected to arise in them. By using novel, custom-fabricated, picowatt-resolution calorimetric scanning probes, we measured the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance of gold and platinum metallic wires down to single-atom junctions. Our work reveals that the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance of gold single-atom junctions is quantized at room temperature and shows that the Wiedemann-Franz law relating thermal and electrical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance is satisfied even in single-atom contacts. Furthermore, we quantitatively explain our experimental results within the Landauer framework for quantum thermal transport. The experimental techniques reported here will enable thermal transport studies in atomic and molecular chains, which will be key to investigating numerous fundamental issues that thus far have remained experimentally inaccessible.</p>

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-loading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>way has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-loading types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. However, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the structure of PD has not been considered, even though it could impact permeability, and functional data are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, structure, and function using data from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ed for all relevant cell–cell interfaces in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-loading types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell interfaces in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-loading type. PD density data of single interfaces, even combined with PD diameter and length data, did not correlate with the intercellular diffusion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD substructure not visible on standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results support a proposed passive symplasmic loading mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD structure differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-loading species.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As water often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant water capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of water across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root water transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ways and root radial hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream hydraulic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of water-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of water flow across roots. The explicit root hydraulic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root water relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root hydraulics.</p>

Carbonic Anhydrase Mutants in <i>Zea mays</i> Have Altered Stomatal Responses to Environmental Signals
<p>Stomata regulate transpirational water loss and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis in response to changing environmental conditions. Research investigating stomatal movement has mostly been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ed in C<sub>3</sub> eudicot species, which have very different CO<sub>2</sub> requirements for photosynthesis relative to C<sub>4</sub> grasses. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub>, and its activity has been linked to stomatal aperture regulation in eudicots. The number of <i>Ca</i> genes and their evolutionary history differ between monocots and dicots, and many questions remain unanswered about potential neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization of grass <i>Ca</i> paralogs and their roles in photosynthesis and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance. To investigate the roles of different <i>Ca</i> genes in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we examined stomatal responses in <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants as well as a <i>ca1ca2</i> double mutant. The <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants had 10% and 87% of the CA activity exhibited by the wild type, respectively, while <i>ca1ca2</i> had less than 5% of wild-type CA activity. The <i>ca</i> mutants had higher stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance than the wild type and slower stomatal closure in response to increases in CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure. Contrary to previous reports in eudicots, <i>ca</i> mutants showed slowed stomatal closure in response to the light-dark transition and did not show differences in stomatal density compared with the wild type. These results implicate CA-mediated signaling in the control of stomatal movement but not stomatal development. Drought experiments with <i>ca1ca2</i> mutant plants suggest a role for CA in water-use efficiency and reveal that <i>Z. mays</i> is not optimized for water-use efficiency under well-watered conditions.</p>

Stomatal VPD Response: There Is More to the Story Than ABA
<p>Guard cells shrink and close stomatal pores when air humidity decreases (i.e. when the difference between the vapor pressures of leaf and atmosphere [VPD] increases). The role of abscisic acid (ABA) in VPD-induced stomatal closure has been studied using ABA-related mutants that respond to VPD in some studies and not in others. The importance of ABA biosynthesis in guard cells versus vasculature for whole-plant stomatal regulation is unclear as well. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines carrying mutations in different steps of ABA biosynthesis as well as pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <i>wilty</i> and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>flacca</i> ABA-deficient mutants had higher stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance compared with wild-type plants. To characterize the role of ABA production in different cells, we generated transgenic plants where ABA biosynthesis was rescued in guard cells or phloem companion cells of an ABA-deficient mutant. In both cases, the whole-plant stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance, stunted growth phenotype, and leaf ABA level were restored to wild-type values, pointing to the redundancy of ABA sources and to the effectiveness of leaf ABA transport. All ABA-deficient lines closed their stomata rapidly and extensively in response to high VPD, whereas plants with mutated protein kinase OST1 showed stunted VPD-induced responses. Another strongly ABA-insensitive mutant, defective in the six ABA PYR/RCAR receptors, responded to changes in VPD in both directions strongly and symmetrically, indicating that its VPD-induced closure could be passive hydraulic. We discuss that both the VPD-induced passive hydraulic stomatal closure and the stomatal VPD regulation of ABA-deficient mutants may be conditional on the initial pretreatment stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance.</p>

The Polycomb-Group Repressor MEDEA Attenuates Pathogen Defense
<p>Plants recruit positive and negative regulators for fine tuning the balance between growth and development. Negative regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ogen defense generally modulate defense hormone biosynthesis and signaling. Here, we report a mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation of the defense response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), which is mediated by the polycomb-group repressor MEDEA (MEA). Our results showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ogen inoculation or exogenous application of salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, or the bacterial 22-amino acid domain of flagellin peptide induces the expression of <i>MEA</i>. <i>MEA</i> expression was higher when plants were inoculated with the avirulent strain of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) carrying the <i>AvrRpt2</i> effector (<i>Pst-AvrRpt2</i>) compared to the virulent <i>Pst</i> strain. <i>MEA</i> remains suppressed during the vegetative phase via DNA and histone (H3K27) methylation, and only the maternal copy is expressed in the female gametophyte and endosperm via histone and DNA demethylation. In contrast, <i>Pst-AvrRpt2</i> induces high levels of <i>MEA</i> expression via hyper-accumulation of H3K4me3 at the <i>MEA</i> locus. <i>MEA</i>-overexpressing transgenic plants are susceptible to the fungal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ogen <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ogens <i>Pst</i> and <i>Pst-AvrRpt2</i>, whereas <i>mea</i> mutant plants are more resistant to bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ogens. <i>AvrRpt2</i>-mediated immunity requires the function of RESISTANCE TO P. SYRINGAE2 (RPS2) in Arabidopsis. Using transcriptional analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we established that MEA directly targets <i>RPS2</i> and suppresses its transcription. We screened an Arabidopsis cDNA library using MEA as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay and identified DROUGHT-INDUCED19, a transcription factor that interacts with MEA and recruits it at the <i>RPS2</i> promoter. The results identified a previously unknown mechanism of defense response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation in plants.</p>

Large Crown Root Number Improves Topsoil Foraging and Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>Suboptimal phosphorus (P) availability is a primary constraint to plant growth on Earth. We tested the hypothesis that maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) genotypes with large crown root number (CN) will have shallower rooting depth and improved P acquisition from low-P soils. Maize recombinant inbred lines with contrasting CN were evaluated under suboptimal P availability in greenhouse mesocosms and the field. Under P stress in mesocosms, the large-CN phenotype had 48% greater root respiration, 24% shallower rooting depth, 32% greater root length density in the topsoil, 37% greater leaf P concentration, 48% greater leaf photosynthesis, 33% greater stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance, and 44% greater shoot biomass than the small-CN phenotype. Under P stress in the field, the large-CN phenotype had 32% shallower rooting depth, 51% greater root length density in the topsoil, 44% greater leaf P concentration, 18% greater leaf photosynthesis, 21% greater stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance, 23% greater shoot biomass at anthesis, and 28% greater yield than the small-CN phenotype. These results support the hypothesis that large CN improves plant P acquisition from low-P soils by reducing rooting depth and increasing topsoil foraging. The large-CN phenotype merits consideration as a selection target to improve P capture in maize and possibly other cereal crops.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer drought resistance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in rice, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these plants exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by rice plants under drought stress. The leaves of STTM166 rice plants had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 plants had reduced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified rice <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, rice plants overexpressing a miR166-resistant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 plants, including leaf rolling and higher drought resistance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that drought resistance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic plants’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

Light Signaling-Dependent Regulation of Photoinhibition and Photoprotection in Tomato<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Photoreceptor-mediated light signaling plays a critical role in plant growth, development, and stress responses but its contribution to the spatial regulation of photoinhibition and photoprotection within the canopy remains unclear. Here, we show that low-red/far-red (<i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>) ratio light conditions significantly alleviate PSII and PSI photoinhibition in the shade leaves of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants. This protection is accompanied by a phytochrome A-dependent induction of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). HY5 binds to the promoter of <i>ABA INSENSITIVE</i>5 (<i>ABI5</i>), triggering <i>RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG1</i> (<i>RBOH1</i>)-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the apoplast. Decreased levels of <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcripts increased cold-induced photoinhibition and abolished <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-induced alleviation of photoinhibition. <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> illumination induced nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence and increased the activities of Foyer-Halliwell-Asada cycle enzymes and cyclic electron flux (CEF) around PSI. In contrast, decreased <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcript levels abolished the positive effect of <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> on photoprotection. Loss of <i>PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5</i>-dependent CEF led to increased photoinhibition and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-dependent NPQ. These data demonstrate that HY5 is an important hub in the cross talk between light and cold response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ways, integrating ABA and reactive oxygen species signaling, leading to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation of photoinhibition by enhanced induction of photoprotection in shade leaves.</p>

A Violaxanthin Deepoxidase Interacts with a Viral Suppressor of RNA Silencing to Inhibit Virus Amplification
<p>RNA silencing plays a critical role against viral infection. To counteract this antiviral silencing, viruses have evolved various RNA silencing suppressors. Meanwhile, plants have evolved counter-counter defense strategies against RNA silencing suppression (RSS). In this study, the violaxanthin deepoxidase protein of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), ZmVDE, was shown to interact specifically with the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro; a viral RNA silencing suppressor) of <i>Sugarcane mosaic virus</i> (SCMV) via its mature protein region by yeast two-hybrid assay, which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells. It was demonstrated that amino acids 101 to 460 in HC-Pro and the amino acid glutamine-292 in ZmVDE mature protein were essential for this interaction. The mRNA levels of <i>ZmVDE</i> were down-regulated 75% to 65% at an early stage of SCMV infection. Interestingly, ZmVDE, which normally localized in the chloroplasts and cytoplasm, could relocalize to HC-Pro-containing aggregate bodies in the presence of HC-Pro alone or SCMV infection. In addition, ZmVDE could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ate the RSS activity of HC-Pro in a specific protein interaction-dependent manner. Subsequently, transient silencing of the <i>ZmVDE</i> gene facilitated SCMV RNA and coat protein accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that ZmVDE interacts with SCMV HC-Pro and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ates its RSS activity, contributing to decreased SCMV accumulation. This study demonstrates that a host factor can be involved in secondary defense responses against viral infection in monocot plants.</p>

Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (γ) of xylem sap plays a key role in stabilizing air-water interfaces at the pits between water- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low water potentials. We studied seasonal changes in xylem sap γ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine timberline. We analyzed their vulnerability to drought-induced embolism using solutions of different γ and estimated the potential effect of seasonal changes in γ on hydraulic vulnerability. In both species, xylem sap γ showed distinct seasonal courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. Solutions with low γ caused higher vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism. The water potential at 50% loss of hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was −3.35 and −3.86 MPa at γ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup> but −2.11 and −2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa seasonal variation in 50% loss of hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity. The results revealed pronounced effects of changes in xylem sap γ on the hydraulic safety of trees in situ. These effects also are relevant in vulnerability analyses, where the use of standard solutions with high γ overestimates hydraulic safety. Thus, γ should be considered carefully in hydraulic studies.</p>

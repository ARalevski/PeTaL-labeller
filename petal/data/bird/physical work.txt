Activity levels and return to work following total knee arthroplasty in patients under 65 years of age
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about employment following total knee arthroplasty   (TKA). This study aims to identify factors which predict return   to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> following TKA in patients of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing age in the United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients & Methods</title><p>We prospectively assessed 289 patients (289 TKAs) aged ≤ 65 years   who underwent TKA between 2010 and 2013. There were 148 women. The   following were recorded pre-operatively: age, gender, body mass   index, social deprivation, comorbidities, indication for surgery,   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> status and nature of employment, activity level as assessed by   the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score   and Oxford Knee Score (OKS). The intention of patients to return   to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> or to retire was not assessed pre-operatively. At a mean   of 3.4 years (2 to 4) post-operatively, the return to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> status,   OKS, the EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) score, UCLA activity score   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>, Osteoarthritis and joint-Replacement (WORQ) score were   obtained. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 261 patients (90%) who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing before TKA, 105 (40%)   returned to any job, including 89 (34%) who returned to the same   job at a mean of 13.5 weeks (2 to 104) post-operatively. A total   of 108 (41%) retired following TKA and 18 remained on welfare. Patients   not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing before the operation did not return to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>. Median   UCLA scores improved in 125 patients (58%) from 4 (mild activity)   to 6 (moderate activity) (p < 0.001). Significant    (p < 0.05) factors which were predictive of return to any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>   included age, heavy or moderate manual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>, better post-operative   UCLA, OKS and EQ-5D general health scores. Significant predictive   factors of return to the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> included age, heavy or moderate   manual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> and post-operative OKS.

Infants make more attempts to achieve a goal when they see adults persist
<p>Persistence, above and beyond IQ, is associated with long-term academic outcomes. To look at the effect of adult models on infants’ persistence, we conducted an experiment in which 15-month-olds were assigned to one of three conditions: an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong> condition in which they saw an adult try repeatedly, using various methods, to achieve each of two different goals; a No <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong> condition in which the adult achieved the goals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>lessly; or a Baseline condition. Infants were then given a difficult, novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">task</span></strong>. Across an initial study and two preregistered experiments (<i>N</i> = 262), infants in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong> condition made more attempts to achieve the goal than did infants in the other conditions. Pedagogical cues modulated the effect. The results suggest that adult models causally affect infants’ persistence and that infants can generalize the value of persistence to novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">task</span></strong>s.</p>

Reactivation of latent working memories with transcranial magnetic stimulation
<p>The ability to hold information in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory is fundamental for cognition. Contrary to the long-standing view that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory depends on sustained, elevated activity, we present evidence suggesting that humans can hold information in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory via “activity-silent” synaptic mechanisms. Using multivariate pattern analyses to decode brain activity patterns, we found that the active representation of an item in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory drops to baseline when attention shifts away. A targeted pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation produced a brief reemergence of the item in concurrently measured brain activity. This reactivation effect occurred and influenced memory performance only when the item was potentially relevant later in the trial, which suggests that the representation is dynamic and modifiable via cognitive control. The results support a synaptic theory of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory.</p>

Energy pulses reveal possible new state of memory
<p>Memory researchers have shone light into a cognitive limbo. A new memory—the name of someone you've just met, for example—is held for seconds in so-called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory, as your brain's neurons continue to fire. If the person is important to you, the name will over a few days enter your long-term memory, preserved by permanently altered neural connections. But where does it go during the in-between hours, when it has left your standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory and is not yet embedded in long-term memory? To figure this out, a research team resurrects memories from this limbo. Their observations point to a new form of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory, which they dub prioritized long-term memory, that exists without elevated neural activity. Consistent with other recent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>, the study suggests that information can somehow be held among the synapses that connect neurons, even after conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory has faded. This new memory state could have a range of practical implications, from helping college students learn more efficiently to assisting people with memory-related neurological conditions such as amnesia, epilepsy, and schizophrenia.</p>

Toward a chemical vaccine for malaria
<p>Despite considerable progress in combating malaria, it remains one of the world's most important infectious diseases, with 50% of the world population at risk of developing the disease and a mortality rate of ∼0.5 million annually (<i>1</i>). The lack of an effective vaccine and the relentless ability of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite responsible for malaria to develop drug resistance has contributed to the continuing disease burden (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of current treatment regimens, but decreased effectiveness, particularly in Southeast Asia, threatens our ability to control this disease. A global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong> to develop new drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria is under way but not guaranteed to succeed (<i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s include a systematic attempt to target all life-cycle stages of the parasite to allow combination therapies to be developed, which are also likely to reduce the development of resistance. High-throughput screens (HTSs) designed to identify small drug-like molecules that prevent growth of blood-stage parasites (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and target-based approaches have identified new compounds that are currently in preclinical development and/or various stages of human clinical trials for treatment of malaria (<i>3</i>). Missing from these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s has been a high-throughput technology to find liver stage–specific chemotypes. On page 1129 of this issue, Antonova-Koch <i>et al.</i> (<i>9</i>) report an HTS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong> that has filled this gap. They identify a substantial number of new chemical starting points with potent liver-stage antimalarial activity, promising a new capacity to feed compounds through the drug development pipeline for chemoprotection.</p>

Eradication genomics—lessons for parasite control
<p>Large-scale programs are seeking to control or eliminate infectious diseases with the greatest impact on global health. Many of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s target the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that disproportionately affect the lives of the poor. Often the aim is to eradicate the causative pathogens. The idea—inspired by the success of smallpox eradication in the 1960s and 1970s—is that a large-scale, but time-limited, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong> could eliminate a disease for all successive generations, resulting in an enormous payoff both financially and in improved health. Here, we discuss the value of genomic approaches to support disease eradication <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s, particularly by analogy with how conservation genomics is supporting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s to prevent extinctions.</p>

GTPase activity–coupled treadmilling of the bacterial tubulin FtsZ organizes septal cell wall synthesis
<p>The bacterial tubulin FtsZ is the central component of the cell division machinery, coordinating an ensemble of proteins involved in septal cell wall synthesis to ensure successful constriction. How cells achieve this coordination is unknown. We found that in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells, FtsZ exhibits dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treadmil</span></strong>ling predominantly determined by its guanosine triphosphatase activity. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treadmil</span></strong>ling dynamics direct the processive movement of the septal cell wall synthesis machinery but do not limit the rate of septal synthesis. In FtsZ mutants with severely reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treadmil</span></strong>ling, the spatial distribution of septal synthesis and the molecular composition and ultrastructure of the septal cell wall were substantially altered. Thus, FtsZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treadmil</span></strong>ling provides a mechanism for achieving uniform septal cell wall synthesis to enable correct polar morphology.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Bloomsbury report on mouse embryo phenotyping: recommendations from the IMPC workshop on embryonic lethal screening
<p>Identifying genes that are important for embryo development is a crucial first step towards understanding their many functions in driving the ordered growth, differentiation and organogenesis of embryos. It can also shed light on the origins of developmental disease and congenital abnormalities. Current international <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s to examine gene function in the mouse provide a unique opportunity to pinpoint genes that are involved in embryogenesis, owing to the emergence of embryonic lethal knockout mutants. Through internationally coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) has generated a public resource of mouse knockout strains and, in April 2012, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), supported by the EU InfraCoMP programme, convened a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>shop to discuss developing a phenotyping pipeline for the investigation of embryonic lethal knockout lines. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>shop brought together over 100 scientists, from 13 countries, who are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing in the academic and commercial research sectors, including experts and opinion leaders in the fields of embryology, animal imaging, data capture, quality control and annotation, high-throughput mouse production, phenotyping, and reporter gene analysis. This article summarises the outcome of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>shop, including (1) the vital scientific importance of phenotyping embryonic lethal mouse strains for basic and translational research; (2) a common frame<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> to harmonise international <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s within this context; (3) the types of phenotyping that are likely to be most appropriate for systematic use, with a focus on 3D embryo imaging; (4) the importance of centralising data in a standardised form to facilitate data mining; and (5) the development of online tools to allow open access to and dissemination of the phenotyping data.</p>

Congo rapidly curtails Ebola
<p>An outbreak of Ebola that surfaced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 8 May has petered out and, for the first time, a vaccine may have had a role in containing spread. To date, Ebola has struck 53 people in the DRC's Équateur province, killing 29. Most everyone lived in remote, difficult-to-reach villages, although four cases surfaced in the heavily populated city of Mbandaka, triggering serious concerns of an epidemic exploding. A vigorous, rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong> to contain spread began immediately, with the DRC's Ministry of Public Health <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing with international partners to build treatment facilities, conduct surveillance, and trace contacts of cases. On 21 May, a vaccine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong> began that focused on creating a "ring" around cases by vaccinating people they may have come in contact with directly or indirectly. Some 3300 people received the vaccine, which is still experimental and was given in a clinical trial. But the trial did not have a control group, so it will not be possible to assess the precise role, if any, it played in stopping spread. Then again, no one who received the vaccine developed the disease as of yet, and researchers noted that simply providing it helped with Ebola education.</p>

Bumblebees show cognitive flexibility by improving on an observed complex behavior
<p>We explored bees’ behavioral flexibility in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">task</span></strong> that required transporting a small ball to a defined location to gain a reward. Bees were pretrained to know the correct location of the ball. Subsequently, to obtain a reward, bees had to move a displaced ball to the defined location. Bees that observed demonstration of the technique from a live or model demonstrator learned the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">task</span></strong> more efficiently than did bees observing a “ghost” demonstration (ball moved via magnet) or without demonstration. Instead of copying demonstrators moving balls over long distances, observers solved the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">task</span></strong> more efficiently, using the ball positioned closest to the target, even if it was of a different color than the one previously observed. Such unprecedented cognitive flexibility hints that entirely novel behaviors could emerge relatively swiftly in species whose lifestyle demands advanced learning abilities, should relevant ecological pressures arise.</p>

Treadmilling by FtsZ filaments drives peptidoglycan synthesis and bacterial cell division
<p>The mechanism by which bacteria divide is not well understood. Cell division is mediated by filaments of FtsZ and FtsA (FtsAZ) that recruit septal peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes to the division site. To understand how these components coordinate to divide cells, we visualized their movements relative to the dynamics of cell wall synthesis during cytokinesis. We found that the division septum was built at discrete sites that moved around the division plane. FtsAZ filaments <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treadmil</span></strong>led circumferentially around the division ring and drove the motions of the peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes. The FtsZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treadmil</span></strong>ling rate controlled both the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis and cell division. Thus, FtsZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treadmil</span></strong>ling guides the progressive insertion of new cell wall by building increasingly smaller concentric rings of peptidoglycan to divide the cell.</p>

Protective Effects of Ticagrelor on Myocardial Injury After Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist ticagrelor has been shown to be clinically superior to clopidogrel. Although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, ticagrelor may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exert</span></strong> off-target effects through adenosine-related mechanisms. We aimed to investigate whether ticagrelor reduces myocardial injury to a greater extent than clopidogrel after myocardial infarction (MI) at a similar level of platelet inhibition and to determine the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pigs received the following before MI induction: (1) placebo-control; (2) a loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg); (3) a loading dose of ticagrelor (180 mg); or (4) a loading dose of ticagrelor followed by an adenosine A1/A2-receptor antagonist [8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline, 4 mg/kg intravenous] to determine the potential contribution of adenosine in ticagrelor-related cardioprotection. Animals received the corresponding maintenance doses of the antiplatelet agents during the following 24 hours and underwent 3T-cardiac MRI analysis. Platelet inhibition was monitored by ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In the myocardium, we assessed the expression and activation of proteins known to modulate edema formation, including aquaporin-4 and AMP-activated protein kinase and its downstream effectors CD36 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Clopidogrel and ticagrelor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exert</span></strong>ed a high and consistent antiplatelet effect (68.2% and 62.2% of platelet inhibition, respectively, on challenge with 20 μmol/L ADP) that persisted up to 24 hours post-MI (<i>P</i><0.05). All groups showed comparable myocardial area-at-risk and cardiac worsening after MI induction. 3T-Cardiac MRI analysis revealed that clopidogrel- and ticagrelor-treated animals had a significantly smaller extent of MI than placebo-control animals (15.7 g left ventricle and 12.0 g left ventricle versus 22.8 g left ventricle, respectively). Yet, ticagrelor reduced infarct size to a significantly greater extent than clopidogrel (further 23.5% reduction; <i>P</i>=0.0026), an effect supported by troponin-I assessment and histopathologic analysis (<i>P</i>=0.0021). Furthermore, in comparison with clopidogrel, ticagrelor significantly diminished myocardial edema by 24.5% (<i>P</i>=0.004), which correlated with infarct mass (<i>r</i>=0.73; <i>P</i><0.001). 8-(<i>p</i>-Sulfophenyl)theophylline administration abolished the cardioprotective effects of ticagrelor over clopidogrel. At a molecular level, aquaporin-4 expression decreased and the expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling and cyclooxygenase-2 increased in the ischemic myocardium of ticagrelor- versus clopidogrel-treated animals (<i>P</i><0.05). These protein changes were not observed in those animals administered the adenosine receptor blocker 8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ticagrelor, beyond its antiplatelet efficacy, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exert</span></strong>s cardioprotective effects by reducing necrotic injury and edema formation via adenosine-dependent mechanisms.</p></sec>

Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p>Cell motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and cancer cell invasion. It is generally thought that migrating cells grab and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exert</span></strong> traction force onto the extracellular matrix in order to pull the cell body forward. While previous studies have shown that myosin II deficient cells migrate efficiently, whether these cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exert</span></strong> traction forces during cell migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a force sensor and shRNA specific to each myosin II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how myosin IIA and IIB individually regulate cell migration and traction force generation. Myosin IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction force was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual myosin II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, myosin IIA deficient cells lost actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas myosin IIB deficient cells maintained similar actin organization and focal adhesions as wild-type cells. Interestingly, myosin IIA deficient cells migrated faster than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet myosin IIA deficient cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exert</span></strong>ed significantly less traction force at the leading edge than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells. These results suggest that, in the absence of myosin IIA mediated force-generating machinery, cells move with minimal traction forces at the cell periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of cells to adapt and migrate.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Experiments

Recent years have witnessed intense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s toward exploiting these phenomena in photonics. Here we demonstrate a nonmagnetic topological insulator laser system exhibiting topologically protected transport in the cavity. Its topological properties give rise to single-mode lasing, robustness against defects, and considerably higher slope efficiencies compared to the topologically trivial counterparts. We further exploit the properties of active topological platforms by assembling the system from <i>S</i>-chiral microresonators, enforcing predetermined unidirectional lasing without magnetic fields.

In a proof-of-concept study published in this week's issue of <i>Science</i>, Harvard University's David Liu and Weixin Tang exploit the components of CRISPR to create two new recording systems that they call a CRISPR-mediated analog multievent recording apparatus, or CAMERA for short. One CAMERA system records with the help of plasmids, circular pieces of DNA that float around bacterial cell cytoplasms. In this scheme, CRISPR kicks into action in response to a stimulus like light, an antibiotic, or a virus, directing the destruction of one of two nearly identical "recorder" plasmids. A tilt in the ratio of recorder one to recorder two captures the exposure to the stimulus, even offering details about the duration and intensity of the exposure. The second CAMERA, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>s in mammalian cells as well, uses a CRISPR variant called a base editor to alter the DNA in a "safe harbor" gene that can change its sequence without harming the cell. They show how the changes in the safe harbor gene's sequence can record signals from the cellular processes that a stimulus triggers, such as turning on a cancer-causing biochemical pathway.</p>

A global atlas of the dominant bacteria found in soil
<p>The immense diversity of soil bacterial communities has stymied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s to characterize individual taxa and document their global distributions. We analyzed soils from 237 locations across six continents and found that only 2% of bacterial phylotypes (~500 phylotypes) consistently accounted for almost half of the soil bacterial communities worldwide. Despite the overwhelming diversity of bacterial communities, relatively few bacterial taxa are abundant in soils globally. We clustered these dominant taxa into ecological groups to build the first global atlas of soil bacterial taxa. Our study narrows down the immense number of bacterial taxa to a “most wanted” list that will be fruitful targets for genomic and cultivation-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s aimed at improving our understanding of soil microbes and their contributions to ecosystem functioning.</p>

Ten-month-old infants infer the value of goals from the costs of actions
<p>Infants understand that people pursue goals, but how do they learn which goals people prefer? We tested whether infants solve this problem by inverting a mental model of action planning, trading off the costs of acting against the rewards actions bring. After seeing an agent attain two goals equally often at varying costs, infants expected the agent to prefer the goal it attained through costlier actions. These expectations held across three experiments that conveyed cost through different physical path features (height, width, and incline angle), suggesting that an abstract variable—such as “force,” “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>,” or “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>”—supported infants’ inferences. We modeled infants’ expectations as Bayesian inferences over utility-theoretic calculations, providing a bridge to recent quantitative accounts of action understanding in older children and adults.</p>

Visualizing the function and fate of neutrophils in sterile injury and repair
<p>Neutrophils have been implicated as harmful cells in a variety of inappropriate inflammatory conditions where they injure the host, leading to the death of the neutrophils and their subsequent phagocytosis by monocytes and macrophages. Here we show that in a fully repairing sterile thermal hepatic injury, neutrophils also penetrate the injury site and perform the critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">task</span></strong>s of dismantling injured vessels and creating channels for new vascular regrowth. Upon completion of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">task</span></strong>s, they neither die at the injury site nor are phagocytosed. Instead, many of these neutrophils reenter the vasculature and have a preprogrammed journey that entails a sojourn in the lungs to up-regulate CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4) before entering the bone marrow, where they undergo apoptosis.</p>

Why is the flu vaccine so mediocre?
<p>With flu season around the corner in the United States and Europe, the push has begun once again to encourage people to receive their annual shots. But over the past few years, it's become increasingly clear that the level of protection offered by the vaccine varies widely each flu season, from 10% to 60%. And new research has revealed surprising reasons for its lackluster performance. For decades, it appeared that the vaccine had an efficacy of 70% to 90%, but scientists now know that's because they were using a misleading test—replaced in the 1990s—to assess whether it protected people. The traditional explanation for failure also has been revamped. The flu strains selected for the vaccine change each year based on what's in circulation, and scientists long blamed failure on mutations that occur in the circulating viruses in the 6–8 months that pass between the vaccine being manufactured and used. But these "mismatches" sometimes occur in years when there's solid protection, and some years with lots of failure have good matches. It turns out that other forces at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> include mutations in the strain selected for the vaccine during the manufacturing process, which grows the virus in eggs. People's prior exposure to influenza also can bias their immune system toward a response that undermines that vaccine-triggered immunity. And the vaccine strain selection process itself relies heavily on the ferret animal model, which can mislead, too. There's an increasing call now to improve the vaccine and organize the research community to more collaboratively try to develop a "universal" flu shot that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>s against many strains and lasts for many years, if not a lifetime. </p>

A cargo-sorting DNA robot
<p>Two critical challenges in the design and synthesis of molecular robots are modularity and algorithm simplicity. We demonstrate three modular building blocks for a DNA robot that performs cargo sorting at the molecular level. A simple algorithm encoding recognition between cargos and their destinations allows for a simple robot design: a single-stranded DNA with one leg and two foot domains for walking, and one arm and one hand domain for picking up and dropping off cargos. The robot explores a two-dimensional testing ground on the surface of DNA origami, picks up multiple cargos of two types that are initially at unordered locations, and delivers them to specified destinations until all molecules are sorted into two distinct piles. The robot is designed to perform a random walk without any energy supply. Exploiting this feature, a single robot can repeatedly sort multiple cargos. Localization on DNA origami allows for distinct cargo-sorting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">task</span></strong>s to take place simultaneously in one test tube or for multiple robots to collectively perform the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">task</span></strong>.</p>

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally transmitted Zika virus has been documented in the United States this year, a reflection of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid spread of the virus through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population immune. This so-called "herd immunity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika virus to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of transmission between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a vaccine against Zika, which caused widespread alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain deformities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the virus while they were pregnant. But with transmission in the region becoming scarce, it does complicate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s of clinical trials that hope to show lower rates of transmission and disease in vaccinated people. One such trial is underway right now.</p>

Atomic-layered Au clusters on α-MoC as catalysts for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction
<p>The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (where carbon monoxide plus water yields dihydrogen and carbon dioxide) is an essential process for hydrogen generation and carbon monoxide removal in various energy-related chemical operations. This equilibrium-limited reaction is favored at a low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing temperature. Potential application in fuel cells also requires a WGS catalyst to be highly active, stable, and energy-efficient and to match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing temperature of on-site hydrogen generation and consumption units. We synthesized layered gold (Au) clusters on a molybdenum carbide (α-MoC) substrate to create an interfacial catalyst system for the ultralow-temperature WGS reaction. Water was activated over α-MoC at 303 kelvin, whereas carbon monoxide adsorbed on adjacent Au sites was apt to react with surface hydroxyl groups formed from water splitting, leading to a high WGS activity at low temperatures.</p>

History of winning remodels thalamo-PFC circuit to reinforce social dominance

In vivo optogenetic-based long-term potentiation and depression experiments establish that the mediodorsal thalamic input to the dmPFC mediates long-lasting changes in the social dominance status that are affected by history of winning. The same neural circuit also underlies transfer of dominance between different social contests. These results provide a frame<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> for understanding the circuit basis of adaptive and pathological social behaviors.</p>

Overlapping memory trace indispensable for linking, but not recalling, individual memories
<p>Memories are not stored in isolation from other memories but are integrated into associative net<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>s. However, the mechanisms underlying memory association remain elusive. Using two amygdala-dependent behavioral paradigms—conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and auditory-cued fear conditioning (AFC)—in mice, we found that presenting the conditioned stimulus used for the CTA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">task</span></strong> triggered the conditioned response of the AFC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">task</span></strong> after natural coreactivation of the memories. This was accompanied through an increase in the overlapping neuronal ensemble in the basolateral amygdala. Silencing of the overlapping ensemble suppressed CTA retrieval-induced freezing. However, retrieval of the original CTA or AFC memory was not affected. A small population of coshared neurons thus mediates the link between memories. They are not necessary for recalling individual memories.</p>

A Price to Pay for Adult Neurogenesis
<p>We tend to believe that plasticity is what makes brain circuits adaptable to continuous changes in environmental demands and that greater brain plasticity should result in a better ability to cope with the surrounding world. To adapt to everyday life, animals explore, learn, and remember, and these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">task</span></strong>s make use of various cortical structures, including the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus, part of the hippocampus, is a remarkable structure in that it is one of two areas of the adult mammalian brain, including the human brain, that continue to generate new neurons throughout postnatal life (<i>1</i>). It is well established that adult-born neurons integrate into preexisting neuronal net<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>s and participate in information processing (<i>2</i>). Much evidence accumulated over the past decade supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis itself is a type of circuit plasticity required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory recall.

Leaf and Plant Age Affects Photosynthetic Performance and Photoprotective Capacity
<p>In this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>, we studied the changes in high-light tolerance and photosynthetic activity in leaves of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette throughout the vegetative stage of growth. We implemented an image-analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> flow to analyze the capacity of both the whole plant and individual leaves to cope with excess excitation energy by following the changes in absorbed light energy partitioning. The data show that leaf and plant age are both important factors influencing the fate of excitation energy. During the dark-to-light transition, the age of the plant affects mostly steady-state levels of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching, leading to an increased photosynthetic performance of its leaves. The age of the leaf affects the induction kinetics of nonphotochemical quenching. These observations were confirmed using model selection procedures. We further investigated how different leaves on a rosette acclimate to high light and show that younger leaves are less prone to photoinhibition than older leaves. Our results stress that both plant and leaf age should be taken into consideration during the quantification of photosynthetic and photoprotective traits to produce repeatable and reliable results.</p>

Defining the Diverse Cell Populations Contributing to Lignification in Arabidopsis Stems<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many land plants evolved tall and sturdy growth habits due to specialized cells with thick lignified cell walls: tracheary elements that function in water transport and fibers that function in structural support. The objective of this study was to define how and when diverse cell populations contribute lignin precursors, monolignols, to secondary cell walls during lignification of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inflorescence stem. Previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> demonstrated that, when lignin biosynthesis is suppressed in fiber and tracheary element cells with thickened walls, fibers become lignin-depleted while vascular bundles still lignify, suggesting that nonlignifying neighboring xylem cells are contributing to lignification. In this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>, we dissect the contributions of different cell types, specifically xylary parenchyma and fiber cells, to lignification of the stem using cell-type-specific promoters to either knock down an essential monolignol biosynthetic gene or to introduce novel monolignol conjugates. Analysis of either reductions in lignin in knockdown lines, or the addition of novel monolignol conjugates, directly identifies the xylary parenchyma and fiber cell populations that contribute to the stem lignification and the developmental timing at which each contribution is most important.</p>

Correlations between Circadian Rhythms and Growth in Challenging Environments
<p>In plants, the circadian system controls a plethora of processes, many with agronomic importance, such as photosynthesis, photoprotection, stomatal opening, and photoperiodic development, as well as molecular processes, such as gene expression. It has been suggested that modifying circadian rhythms may be a means to manipulate crops to develop improved plants for agriculture. However, there is very little information on how the clock influences the performance of crop plants. We used a noninvasive, high-throughput technique, based on prompt chlorophyll fluorescence, to measure circadian rhythms and demonstrated that the technique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>s in a range of plants.

Our results show that there is variability for circadian traits in the wild barley lines. We observed that circadian period lengths were correlated with temperature and aspect at the sites of origin of the plants, while the amplitudes of the rhythms were correlated with soil composition. Thus, different environmental parameters may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exert</span></strong> selection on circadian rhythms.</p>

Phloem Transport of the Receptor DWARF14 Protein Is Required for Full Function of Strigolactones<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The cell-to-cell transport of signaling molecules is essential for multicellular organisms to coordinate the action of their cells. Recent studies identified DWARF14 (D14) as a receptor of strigolactones (SLs), molecules that act as plant hormones and inhibit shoot branching. Here, we demonstrate that <i>RAMOSUS3</i>, a pea ortholog of <i>D14</i>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>s as a graft-transmissible signal to suppress shoot branching. In addition, we show that D14 protein is contained in phloem sap and transported through the phloem to axillary buds in rice. SLs are not required for the transport of D14 protein. Disruption of D14 transport weakens the suppression of axillary bud outgrowth of rice. Taken together, we conclude that the D14 protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>s as an intercellular signaling molecule to fine-tune SL function. Our findings provide evidence that the intercellular transport of a receptor can regulate the action of plant hormones.</p>

ZRF1 Chromatin Regulators Have Polycomb Silencing and Independent Roles in Development
<p>Histone H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), catalyzed by Polycomb-Repressive Complex1 (PRC1), is a key epigenetic mark in Polycomb silencing. However, little is known about how H2Aub1 is read to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exert</span></strong> downstream physiological functions. The animal ZUOTIN-RELATED FACTOR1 (ZRF1) has been reported to bind H2Aub1 to promote or repress the expression of varied target genes. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ZRF1 homologs, AtZRF1a and AtZRF1b, are key regulators of multiple processes during plant growth and development. Loss of function of both <i>AtZRF1a</i> and <i>AtZRF1b</i> in <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> mutants causes seed germination delay, small plant size, abnormal meristem activity, abnormal flower development, as well as gametophyte transmission and embryogenesis defects. Some of these defects overlap with those described previously in the PRC1-defective mutants <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i> and <i>atring1a atring1b</i>, but others are specific to <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i>. In line with this, 4,519 genes (representing more than 14% of all genes) within the Arabidopsis genome are found differentially expressed in <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> seedlings, and among them, 114 genes are commonly up-regulated in <i>atring1a atring1b</i> and <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i>. Finally, we show that in both <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> and <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i> seedlings, the seed developmental genes <i>ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3</i>, <i>CRUCIFERIN3</i>, and <i>CHOTTO1</i> are derepressed, in association with the reduced levels of H2Aub1 and histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Collectively, our results indicate that <i>AtZRF1a/b</i> play both PRC1-related and PRC1-unrelated functions in regulating plant growth and development and that <i>AtZRF1a/b</i> promote H2Aub1 and H3K27me3 deposition in gene suppression.

Comparative Genomics of the Pine Pathogens and Beetle Symbionts in the Genus <i>Grosmannia</i>
<p>Studies on beetle/tree fungal symbionts typically characterize the ecological and geographic distributions of the fungal populations. There is limited understanding of the genome-wide evolutionary processes that act within and between species as such fungi adapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess genomic evidence for such evolutionary processes by extending our recent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> on <i>Grosmannia clavigera</i>, which is vectored by the mountain pine beetle and jeffrey pine beetle. We report the genome sequences of an additional 11 <i>G. clavigera</i> (Gc) sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species, <i>Grosmannia</i> sp. (Gs) and Gc. The 12 fungal genomes are structurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between species. We identified 103,430 single-nucleotide variations that separated the <i>Grosmannia</i> strains into divergent Gs and Gc clades, and further divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which may represent an additional species. Comparing variable genes between these lineages, we identified truncated genes and potential pseudogenes, as well as seven genes that show evidence of positive selection. As these variable genes are involved in secondary metabolism and in detoxifying or utilizing host-tree defense chemicals (e.g., polyketide synthases, oxidoreductases, and mono-oxygenases), their variants may reflect adaptation to the specific chemistries of the host trees <i>Pinus contorta</i>, <i>P. ponderosa</i>, and <i>P. jeffreyi</i>. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> provides a comprehensive resource for developing informative markers for landscape population genomics of these ecologically and economically important fungi, and an approach that could be extended to other beetle–tree-associated fungi.</p>

Crohn's Disease Loci Are Common Targets of Protozoa-Driven Selection

Nonetheless, the proportion of risk loci that has been targeted by pathogens and the type of infectious agent(s) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exert</span></strong>ed the strongest pressure remain to be evaluated. We assessed whether different pathogens <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exert</span></strong>ed a pressure on known Crohn's disease (CD) risk variants and demonstrate that these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are preferential targets of protozoa-driven selection (<i>P</i> = 0.008). In particular, 19% of SNPs associated with CD have been subject to protozoa-driven selective pressure. Analysis of <i>P</i> values from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and meta-analyses indicated that protozoan-selected SNPs display significantly stronger association with CD compared with nonselected variants. This same behavior was not observed for GWASs of other autoimmune diseases. Thus, we integrated selection signatures and meta-analysis results to prioritize five genic SNPs for replication in an Italian cohort. Three SNPs were significantly associated with CD risk, and combination with meta-analysis results yielded <i>P</i> values < 4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. The bona fide risk alleles are located in <i>ARHGEF2</i>, an interactor of <i>NOD2, NSF</i>, a gene involved in autophagy, and <i>HEBP1</i>, encoding a possible mediator of inflammation. Pathway analysis indicated that <i>ARHGEF2</i> and <i>NSF</i> participate in a molecular net<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>, which also contains <i>VAMP3</i> (previously associated to CD) and is centered around miR-31 (known to be disregulated in CD).

Arthroscopic decompression not recommended in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Rotator cuff tendinopathy has a multifactorial origin. Rejecting   the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning operative treatment   at initial presentation in the first line. Physiotherapy exercise   programmes are the accepted first line treatment. The aim of this   study was to assess the long-term additional benefits of subacromial decompression   in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This randomised controlled trial of 140 patients (52 men, 88   women, mean age 47.1 years; 18 to 60) with rotator cuff tendinopathy   extended previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> up to a maximum of 13 years. The patients   were randomised into two treatment groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty   and a supervised exercise treatment and a similar supervised exercise   treatment alone. Self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS)   was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures were disability,   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing ability, pain at night, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire   score and the number of painful days during the three months preceding   the final assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 90 patients (64%) returned questionnaires at a mean   12 years after randomisation. On an intention-to-treat basis, both   treatment groups reached statistically significant improvement compared   with the initial VAS for pain, but there was no significant difference   between groups. The same was true in the secondary outcome measures.   Due to group changes, the results were also analysed per protocol:   operated or not. No significant differences between the groups were   found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The natural history of rotator cuff tendinopathy probably plays   a significant role in the results in the long-term. Even though   the patients who underwent operative treatment had a stronger belief   in recovery, which is likely to be surgical and the effect of placebo,   the exercise group obtained similar results. In the future, an optimum   exercise regime should be searched for, as the most clinically and   cost-effective conservative treatment for rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:799–805.</p></sec>

Impact of Regionalization of ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Care on Treatment Times and Outcomes for Emergency Medical Services–Transported Patients Presenting to Hospitals With Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Regional variations in reperfusion times and mortality in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction are influenced by differences in coordinating care between emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals. Building on the Accelerator-1 Project, we hypothesized that time to reperfusion could be further reduced with enhanced regional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between April 2015 and March 2017, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ed with 12 metropolitan regions across the United States with 132 percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals and 946 EMS agencies. Data were collected in the ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Net<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>)-Get With The Guidelines Registry for quarterly Mission: Lifeline reports. The primary end point was the change in the proportion of EMS-transported patients with first medical contact to device time ≤90 minutes from baseline to final quarter. We also compared treatment times and mortality with patients treated in hospitals not participating in the project during the corresponding time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the study period, 10 730 patients were transported to percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals, including 974 in the baseline quarter and 972 in the final quarter who met inclusion criteria. Median age was 61 years; 27% were women, 6% had cardiac arrest, and 6% had shock on admission; 10% were black, 12% were Latino, and 10% were uninsured. By the end of the intervention, all process measures reflecting coordination between EMS and hospitals had improved, including the proportion of patients with a first medical contact to device time of ≤90 minutes (67%–74%; <i>P</i><0.002), a first medical contact to device time to catheterization laboratory activation of ≤20 minutes (38%–56%; <i>P</i><0.0001), and emergency department dwell time of ≤20 minutes (33%–43%; <i>P</i><0.0001). Of the 12 regions, 9 regions reduced first medical contact to device time, and 8 met or exceeded the national goal of 75% of patients treated in ≤90 minutes. Improvements in treatment times corresponded with a significant reduction in mortality (in-hospital death, 4.4%–2.3%; <i>P</i>=0.001) that was not apparent in hospitals not participating in the project during the same time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Organization of care among EMS and hospitals in 12 regions was associated with significant reductions in time to reperfusion in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction as well as in in-hospital mortality. These findings support a more intensive regional approach to emergency care for patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

ICare-ACS (Improving Care Processes for Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s to safely reduce length of stay for emergency department patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have had mixed success. Few system-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effort</span></strong>s affecting multiple hospital emergency departments have ever been evaluated. We evaluated the effectiveness of a nationwide implementation of clinical pathways for potential ACS in disparate hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter pragmatic stepped-wedge before-and-after trial in 7 New Zealand acute care hospitals with 31 332 patients investigated for suspected ACS with serial troponin measurements. The implementation was a clinical pathway for the assessment of patients with suspected ACS that included a clinical pathway document in paper or electronic format, structured risk stratification, specified time points for electrocardiographic and serial troponin testing within 3 hours of arrival, and directions for combining risk stratification and electrocardiographic and troponin testing in an accelerated diagnostic protocol. Implementation was monitored for >4 months and compared with usual care over the preceding 6 months. The main outcome measure was the odds of discharge within 6 hours of presentation</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 11 529 participants in the preimplementation phase (range, 284–3465) and 19 803 in the postimplementation phase (range, 395–5039). Overall, the mean 6-hour discharge rate increased from 8.3% (range, 2.7%–37.7%) to 18.4% (6.8%–43.8%). The odds of being discharged within 6 hours increased after clinical pathway implementation. The odds ratio was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.3–2.6). In patients without ACS, the median length of hospital stays decreased by 2.9 hours (95% confidence interval, 2.4–3.4). For patients discharged within 6 hours, there was no change in 30-day major adverse cardiac event rates (0.52% versus 0.44%; <i>P</i>=0.96). In these patients, no adverse event occurred when clinical pathways were correctly followed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of clinical pathways for suspected ACS reduced the length of stay and increased the proportions of patients safely discharged within 6 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.anzctr.org.au/</ext-link> (Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry).

Human Plasma Thioredoxin-80 Increases With Age and in ApoE<sup>−/−</sup> Mice Induces Inflammation, Angiogenesis, and Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thioredoxin (TRX)-1, a ubiquitous 12-kDa protein, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exert</span></strong>s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, the truncated form, called TRX80, produced by macrophages induces upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. TRX80 also promotes the differentiation of mouse peritoneal and human macrophages toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRX1 and TRX80 plasma levels were determined with a specific ELISA. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein (ADAM)-10, ADAM-17, and ADAM-10 activities were measured with SensoLyte 520 ADAM10 Activity Assay Kit, Fluorimetric, and InnoZyme TACE Activity Kit, respectively. Western immunoblots were performed with specific antibodies to ADAM-10 or ADAM-17. Angiogenesis study was evaluated in vitro with human microvascular endothelial cells-1 and in vivo with the Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in mice. The expression of macrophage phenotype markers was investigated with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Phosphorylation of Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin, and 70S6K was determined with specific antibodies. The effect of TRX80 on NLRP3 inflammasome activity was evaluated by measuring the level of interleukin-1β and -18 in the supernatants of activated macrophages with ELISA. Hearts were used for lesion surface evaluation and immunohistochemical studies, and whole descending aorta were stained with Oil Red O. For transgenic mice generation, the human scavenger receptor (SR-A) promoter/enhancer was used to drive macrophage-specific expression of human TRX80 in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In this study, we observed a significant increase of plasma levels of TRX80 in old subjects compared with healthy young subjects. In parallel, an increase in expression and activity of ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 in old peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with those of young subjects was observed. Furthermore, TRX80 was found to colocalize with tumor necrosis factor-α, a macrophage M1 marker, in human atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, TRX80 induced the expression of murine M1 macrophage markers through Akt2/mechanistic target of rapamycin–C1/70S6K pathway and activated the inflammasome NLRP3, leading to the release of interleukin-1β and -18, potent atherogenic cytokines. Moreover, TRX80 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exert</span></strong>s a powerful angiogenic effect in both in vitro and in vivo mouse studies. Finally, transgenic mice that overexpress human TRX80 specifically in macrophages of apoE<sup>−/−</sup> mice have a significant increase of aortic atherosclerotic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TRX80 showed an age-dependent increase in human plasma. In mouse models, TRX80 was associated with a proinflammatory status and increased atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

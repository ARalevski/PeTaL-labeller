Avian thermoregulation in the heat: phylogenetic variation among avian orders in evaporative cooling capacity and heat tolerance
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Avian evaporative cooling efficiency and heat tolerance display substantial taxonomic variation that are, unexpectedly, not systematically related to the use of panting versus gular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flutter</span></strong> processes.</p>

Avian thermoregulation in the heat: metabolism, evaporative cooling and gular flutter in two small owls
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Small desert owls demonstrate heat tolerance intermediate between that of very heat-tolerant nightjars and less heat-tolerant passerines. The gular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flutter</span></strong> mechanism contributes significantly to cooling efficiency.</p>

Avian thermoregulation in the heat: evaporative cooling capacity of arid-zone Caprimulgiformes from two continents
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Caprimulgiformes demonstrate high heat tolerance that is mediated by low rates of resting metabolism and a very efficient evaporative process that uses a gular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flutter</span></strong> mechanism.</p>

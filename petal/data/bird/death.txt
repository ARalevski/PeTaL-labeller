Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

National Trends in Atrial Fibrillation Hospitalization, Readmission, and Mortality for Medicare Beneficiaries, 1999–2013
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data are lacking on national trends for atrial fibrillation (AF) hospitalization, particularly with regard to long-term outcomes including readmission and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries between 1999 and 2013, and we evaluated rates of hospitalization for AF, in-hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity, length of stay, and hospital payments. We then evaluated rates of long-term outcomes, including 30-day readmission, 30-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity, and 1-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity. To evaluate changes in rates of AF hospitalization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity, we used mixed-effects models, adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidity. To assess changes in rates of 30-day readmission, we constructed a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Adjusted rates of hospitalization for AF increased by ≈1% per year between 1999 and 2013, and although geographic variation was present, this trend was consistent nationwide. Median hospital length of stay remained unchanged at 3.0 (interquartile range 2.0–5.0) days, but median Medicare inpatient expenditure per beneficiary increased from $2932 (interquartile range $2232–$3870) to $4719 (interquartile range $3124–$7209) per stay. During the same period, the rate of inpatient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity during AF hospitalization decreased by 4% per year, and the rate of 30-day readmission decreased by 1% per year. The rates of 30-day and 1-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity decreased more modestly by 0.4% and 0.26% per year, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Between 1999 and 2013, among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, patients were hospitalized more frequently and treated with more costly inpatient therapies such as AF catheter ablation, but this finding was associated with improved outcomes, including lower rates of in-hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity, 30-day readmission, 30-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity, and 1-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity.</p></sec>

Association of Pediatric Medical Emergency Teams With Hospital Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Implementation of medical emergency teams has been identified as a potential strategy to reduce hospital deaths, because these teams respond to patients with acute physiological decline in an effort to prevent in-hospital cardiac arrest. However, prior studies of the association between medical emergency teams and hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity have been limited and typically have not accounted for preimplementation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Within the Pediatric Health Information System for freestanding pediatric hospitals, annual risk-adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity rates were calculated for sites between 2000 and 2015. A random slopes interrupted time series analysis then examined whether implementation of a medical emergency team was associated with lower-than-expected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity rates based on preimplementation trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Across 38 pediatric hospitals, mean annual hospital admission volume was 15 854 (range, 6684–33 024), and there were a total of 1 659 059 hospitalizations preimplementation and 4 392 392 hospitalizations postimplementation. Before medical emergency team implementation, hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity decreased by 6.0% annually (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92–0.96) across all hospitals. After medical emergency team implementation, hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity continued to decrease by 6% annually (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.93–0.95), with no deepening of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity slope (ie, not lower OR) in comparison with the preimplementation trend, for the overall cohort (<i>P</i>=0.98) or when analyzed separately within each of the 38 study hospitals. Five years after medical emergency team implementation across study sites, there was no difference between predicted (hospital mean of 6.18 deaths per 1000 admissions based on preimplementation trends) and actual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity rates (hospital mean of 6.48 deaths per 1000 admissions; <i>P</i>=0.57).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of medical emergency teams in a large sample of pediatric hospitals in the United States was not associated with a reduction in hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity beyond existing preimplementation trends.</p></sec>

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for fractures of the navicular that gives associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es   involving the lateral column due consideration.

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals between PM<sub>2.5</sub> (per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) and heart disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity using the full sample and the sample adults, which have information on additional health variables. Interaction terms were used to examine differences in the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity association by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 65 936 of the full sample died during follow-up, and 22 152 died from heart disease. After adjustment for several factors, we found a significant positive association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.25). This association was similar in sample adults with adjustment for smoking and body mass index (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.31).

Cardioprotective Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 2 by Suppressing Apoptosis and Necroptosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Programmed cell death, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s, mitochondria-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s, and necroptosis, is critically involved in ischemic cardiac injury, pathological cardiac remodeling, and heart failure progression. Whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s and mitochondria-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s signaling is well established, the regulatory mechanisms of necroptosis and its significance in the pathogenesis of heart failure remain elusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined the role of tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s factor receptor-associated factor 2 (Traf2) in regulating myocardial necroptosis and remodeling using genetic mouse models. We also performed molecular and cellular biology studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which Traf2 regulates necroptosis signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified a critical role for Traf2 in myocardial survival and homeostasis by suppressing necroptosis. Cardiac-specific deletion of <i>Traf2</i> in mice triggered necroptotic cardiac cell death, pathological remodeling, and heart failure. Plasma tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s factor α level was significantly elevated in <i>Traf2</i>-deficient mice, and genetic ablation of <i>TNFR1</i> largely abrogated pathological cardiac remodeling and dysfunction associated with Traf2 deletion. Mechanistically, Traf2 critically regulates receptor-interacting proteins 1 and 3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein necroptotic signaling with the adaptor protein tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s factor receptor-associated protein with death domain as an upstream regulator and transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 as a downstream effector. It is important to note that genetic deletion of <i>RIP3</i> largely rescued the cardiac phenotype triggered by Traf2 deletion, validating a critical role of necroptosis in regulating pathological remodeling and heart failure propensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results identify an important Traf2-mediated, NFκB-independent, prosurvival pathway in the heart by suppressing necroptotic signaling, which may serve as a new therapeutic target for pathological remodeling and heart failure.</p></sec>

Integrated Noninvasive Physiological Assessment of Coronary Circulatory Function and Impact on Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is suggested that the integration of maximal myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), termed coronary flow capacity, allows for comprehensive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. Because management decisions are predicated on clinical risk, we sought to determine the independent and integrated value of maximal MBF and CFR for predicting cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MBF and CFR were quantified in 4029 consecutive patients (median age 66 years, 50.5% women) referred for rest/stress myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography scans from January 2006 to December 2013. The primary outcome was cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity. Maximal MBF <1.8 mL·g<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup> and CFR<2 were considered impaired. Four patient groups were identified based on the concordant or discordant impairment of maximal MBF or CFR. Association of maximal MBF and CFR with cardiovascular death was assessed using Cox and Poisson regression analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 392 (9.7%) cardiovascular deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 5.6 years. CFR was a stronger predictor of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity than maximal MBF beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors, left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial scar and ischemia, rate-pressure product, type of radiotracer or stress agent used, and revascularization after scan (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38–2.31; <i>P</i><0.001 per unit decrease in CFR after adjustment for maximal MBF and clinical covariates; and adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.84–1.27; <i>P</i>=0.8 per unit decrease in maximal MBF after adjustment for CFR and clinical covariates). In univariable analyses, patients with concordant impairment of CFR and maximal MBF had high cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity of 3.3% (95% CI, 2.9–3.7) per year. Patients with impaired CFR but preserved maximal MBF had an intermediate cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity of 1.7% (95% CI, 1.3–2.1) per year. These patients were predominantly women (70%). Patients with preserved CFR but impaired maximal MBF had low cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity of 0.9% (95% CI, 0.6–1.6) per year. Patients with concordantly preserved CFR and maximal MBF had the lowest cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity of 0.4% (95 CI, 0.3–0.6) per year. In multivariable analysis, the cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity risk gradient across the 4 concordant or discordant categories was independently driven by impaired CFR irrespective of impairment in maximal MBF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CFR is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity than maximal MBF. Concordant and discordant categories based on integrating CFR and maximal MBF identify unique prognostic phenotypes of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.</p></sec>

A Population-Based Study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Treatment in Finland 2000 to 2014
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the event of rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity is very high. AAA prevalence and incidence of ruptures have been reported to be decreasing. The treatment of AAA has also undergone a change in recent decades with a shift toward endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Our aim was to evaluate how these changes have affected the elective and emergency treatment of AAA and their results in Finland.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for AAA in Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million, during 2000 to 2014 were searched from the registry of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. Data on all patients who had died of AAA during the same time period were obtained from Statistics Finland. The data were combined and analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The annual incidence of ruptured AAA was 16.4 per 100 000 population over 50 years and decreased significantly during the study period. Over half of the 4949 patients who had a ruptured AAA died outside the hospital. Thirty-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity after emergency repair was 39.4%. Intact AAA repairs numbered 4956. The absolute number of annual repairs increased during the study period, and the use of EVAR became the dominant method of elective repair. Thirty-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity in elective AAA repair dropped significantly from 6.3% in 2000 to 2004 to 2.7% in 2010 to 2014 mostly because of the increased number of EVAR procedures with lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity. Long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity in patients treated with EVAR was higher than in patients treated with open repair. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity after elective AAA repair was primarily attributable to cardiovascular causes, but there was a slightly higher proportion of AAA-related late deaths in patients treated with EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ruptured AAA incidence for men >65 years has declined by nearly 30% in Finland, likely because of the decrease in AAA prevalence. The treatment results have improved as well for both elective and emergency repair. Increased use of EVAR has resulted in a decrease of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity after elective AAA repair, but results of open repair have improved as well. However, late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity from elective EVAR is surprisingly high in comparison with open repair, which may have been exaggerated by patient selection.</p></sec>

Population-Based Long-Term Cardiac-Specific Mortality Among 34 489 Five-Year Survivors of Childhood Cancer in Great Britain
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Increased risks of cardiac morbidity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity among childhood cancer survivors have been described previously. However, little is known about the very long-term risks of cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity and whether the risk has decreased among those more recently diagnosed. We investigated the risk of long-term cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity among survivors within the recently extended British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a population-based cohort of 34 489 five-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed from 1940 to 2006 and followed up until February 28, 2014, and is the largest cohort to date to assess late cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity. Standardized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity ratios and absolute excess risks were used to quantify cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity excess risk. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the simultaneous effect of risk factors. Likelihood ratio tests were used to test for heterogeneity and trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 181 cardiac deaths were observed, which was 3.4 times that expected. Survivors were 2.5 times and 5.9 times more at risk of ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy/heart failure death, respectively, than expected. Among those >60 years of age, subsequent primary neoplasms, cardiac disease, and other circulatory conditions accounted for 31%, 22%, and 15% of all excess deaths, respectively, providing clear focus for preventive interventions. The risk of both overall cardiac and cardiomyopathy/heart failure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity was greatest among those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989. Specifically, for cardiomyopathy/heart failure deaths, survivors diagnosed from 1980 to 1989 had 28.9 times the excess number of deaths observed for survivors diagnosed either before 1970 or from 1990 on.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Excess cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer remains increased beyond 50 years of age and has clear messages in terms of prevention strategies. However, the fact that the risk was greatest in those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989 suggests that initiatives to reduce cardiotoxicity among those treated more recently may be having a measurable impact.</p></sec>

The   aim of this study was to examine whether easily identifiable variables   present on admission are associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A consecutive series of 83 elderly patients with a fracture of   the odontoid following a low-impact injury was identified retrospectively.   Data that were collected included demographics, past medical history   and the results of blood tests on admission. Radiological investigations   were used to assess the Anderson and D’Alonzo classification and   displacement of the fracture. The mean age was 82.9 years (65 to   101). Most patients (66; 79.5%) had a type 2 fracture. An associated   neurological deficit was present in 11 (13.3%).

Application of Large-Scale Aptamer-Based Proteomic Profiling to Planned Myocardial Infarctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Emerging proteomic technologies using novel affinity-based reagents allow for efficient multiplexing with high-sample throughput. To identify early biomarkers of myocardial injury, we recently applied an aptamer-based proteomic profiling platform that measures 1129 proteins to samples from patients undergoing septal alcohol ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a human model of planned myocardial injury. Here, we examined the scalability of this approach using a markedly expanded platform to study a far broader range of human proteins in the context of myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a highly multiplexed, expanded proteomic technique that uses single-stranded DNA aptamers to assay 4783 human proteins (4137 distinct human gene targets) to derivation and validation cohorts of planned myocardial injury, individuals with spontaneous myocardial infarction, and at-risk controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found 376 target proteins that significantly changed in the blood after planned myocardial injury in a derivation cohort (n=20; <i>P</i><1.05E-05, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance, Bonferroni threshold). Two hundred forty-seven of these proteins were validated in an independent planned myocardial injury cohort (n=15; <i>P</i><1.33E-04, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance); >90% were directionally consistent and reached nominal significance in the validation cohort. Among the validated proteins that were increased within 1 hour after planned myocardial injury, 29 were also elevated in patients with spontaneous myocardial infarction (n=63; <i>P</i><6.17E-04). Many of the novel markers identified in our study are intracellular proteins not previously identified in the peripheral circulation or have functional roles relevant to myocardial injury. For example, the cardiac LIM protein, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 3, is thought to mediate cardiac mechanotransduction and stress responses, whereas the mitochondrial ATP synthase F<sub>0</sub> subunit component is a vasoactive peptide on its release from cells. Last, we performed aptamer-affinity enrichment coupled with mass spectrometry to technically verify aptamer specificity for a subset of the new biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale aptamer multiplexing at a level that has not previously been reported and with sample throughput that greatly exceeds other existing proteomic methods. The expanded aptamer-based proteomic platform provides a unique opportunity for biomarker and pathway discovery after myocardial injury.</p></sec>

Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction and Myocardial Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are common in clinical practice, but long-term consequences are uncertain. We aimed to define long-term outcomes and explore risk stratification in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified consecutive patients (n=2122) with elevated cardiac troponin I concentrations (≥0.05 µg/L) at a tertiary cardiac center. All diagnoses were adjudicated as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) and noncardiovascular death. To explore competing risks, cause-specific hazard ratios were obtained using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The adjudicated index diagnosis was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively. At 5 years, all-cause death rates were higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (62.5%) or myocardial injury (72.4%) compared with type 1 myocardial infarction (36.7%). The majority of excess deaths in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were because of noncardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.92–2.81 versus type 1 myocardial infarction). Despite this finding, the observed crude major adverse cardiovascular event rates were similar between groups (30.6% versus 32.6%), with differences apparent after adjustment for covariates (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.96). Coronary heart disease was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.24).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite an excess in noncardiovascular death, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury have a similar crude rate of major adverse cardiovascular events as those with type 1 myocardial infarction. Identifying underlying coronary heart disease in this vulnerable population may help target therapies that could modify future risk.</p></sec>

Specialized Adult Congenital Heart Disease Care
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Clinical guidelines recommend specialized care for adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients. In reality, few patients receive such dedicated care. We sought to examine the impact of specialized care on ACHD patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined referral rates to specialized ACHD centers and ACHD patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity rates between 1990 and 2005 in the population-based Quebec Congenital Heart Disease database (n=71 467). This period covers several years before and after the publication of guidelines endorsing specialized care for ACHD patients. A time-series design, based on Joinpoint and Poisson regression analyses, was used to assess the changes in annual referral and patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity rates. The association between specialized ACHD care and all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity was assessed in both case–control and cohort studies. The time-series analysis demonstrated a significant increase in referral rates to specialized ACHD centers in 1997 (rate ratio, +7.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], +6.6% to +8.2%). In parallel, a significant reduction in expected ACHD patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity was observed after year 2000 (rate ratio, −5.0%;95% CI, −10.8% to −0.8%). In exploratory post hoc cohort and case–control analyses, specialized ACHD care was independently associated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.94) and a reduced odds of death (adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.08–0.97), respectively.

Risk of early mortality after cemented compared with cementless total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It has been suggested that cemented fixation of total hip arthroplasty   (THA) is associated with an increased peri-operative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity compared   with cementless THA.

Information about the causes of death, comorbidities, and socioeconomic   background was obtained. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity within the first 90 days after   the operation was the primary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients who underwent cemented THA had an increased risk of   death during the first 14 days compared with the controls (hazard   ratio (HR) 1.3, confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 1.44), corresponding   to an absolute increase in risk of five deaths per 10 000 observations.   No such early increase of risk was seen in those who underwent cementless THA.   Between days 15 and 29 the risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity was decreased for those   with cemented THA (HR 0.7, CI 0.62 to 0.87). Between days 30 and   90 all patients undergoing THA, irrespective of the mode of fixation,   had a lower risk of death than controls. Patients selected for cementless   fixation were younger, healthier and had a higher level of education   and income than those selected for cemented THA. A supplementary   analysis of 16 556 hybrid THAs indicated that cementation of the   femoral component was associated with a slight increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity   up to 15 days, whereas no such increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity was seen in   those with a cemented acetabular component combined with a cementless   femoral component.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This nationwide matched cohort study indicates that patients   receiving cemented THA have a minimally increased relative risk   of early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity that is reversed from day 15 and thereafter.

Pharmacological preconditioning with erythropoietin attenuates the organ injury and dysfunction induced in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock
<p>Pre-treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) has been demonstrated to exert tissue-protective effects against ‘ischemia-reperfusion’-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es. This protection might be mediated by mobilization of bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are thought to secrete paracrine factors. These effects could be exploited to protect against tissue injury induced in cases where hemorrhage is foreseeable, for example, prior to major surgery. Here, we investigate the effects of EPO pre-treatment on the organ injury and dysfunction induced by hemorrhagic shock (HS). Recombinant human EPO (1000 IU/kg/day i.p.) was administered to rats for 3 days. Rats were subjected to HS on day 4 (pre-treatment protocol). Mean arterial pressure was reduced to 35±5 mmHg for 90 minutes, followed by resuscitation with 20 ml/kg Ringer’s lactate for 10 minutes and 50% of the shed blood for 50 minutes. Rats were sacrificed 4 hours after the onset of resuscitation. EPC (CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cell) mobilization was measured following the 3-day pre-treatment with EPO and was significantly increased compared with rats pre-treated with phosphate-buffered saline. EPO pre-treatment significantly attenuated organ injury and dysfunction (renal, hepatic and neuromuscular) caused by HS. In livers from rats subjected to HS, EPO enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt (activation), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β; inhibition) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; activation). In the liver, HS also caused an increase in nuclear translocation of p65 (activation of NF-κB), which was attenuated by EPO. This data suggests that repetitive dosing with EPO prior to injury might protect against the organ injury and dysfunction induced by HS, by a mechanism that might involve mobilization of CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cells, resulting in the activation of the Akt-eNOS survival pathway and inhibition of activation of GSK-3β and NF-κB.</p>

Sex Difference in Patients With Ischemic Heart Failure Undergoing Surgical Revascularization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Female sex is conventionally considered a risk factor for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has been included as a poor prognostic factor in multiple cardiac operative risk evaluation scores. We aimed to investigate the association of sex and the long-term benefit of CABG in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction enrolled in the prospective STICH trial (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure Study).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The STICH trial randomized 1212 patients (148 [12%] women and 1064 [88%] men) with coronary artery disease and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% to CABG+medical therapy (MED) versus MED alone.

Long-Term Potassium Monitoring and Dynamics in Heart Failure and Risk of Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The prognostic value of long-term potassium monitoring and dynamics in heart failure has not been characterized completely. We sought to determine the association between serum potassium values collected at follow-up with all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity in a prospective and consecutive cohort of patients discharged from a previous acute heart failure admission.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Serum potassium was measured at every physician-patient encounter, including hospital admissions and ambulatory settings. The multivariable-adjusted association of serum potassium with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity was assessed by using comprehensive state-of-the-art regression methods that can accommodate time-dependent exposure modeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study sample included 2164 patients with a total of 16 116 potassium observations. Mean potassium at discharge was 4.3±0.48 mEq/L. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L), normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (>5 mEq/L) were observed at the index admission in 77 (3.6%), 1965 (90.8%), and 122 (5.6%) patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 2.8 years (range, 0.03–12.8 years), 1090 patients died (50.4%). On a continuous scale, the multivariable-adjusted association of potassium values and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity revealed a nonlinear association (U-shaped) with higher risk at both ends of its distribution (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.001). Likewise, the adjusted hazard ratios for hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, normokalemia as reference, were 2.35 (95% confidence interval, 1.40–3.93; <i>P</i>=0.001) and 1.55 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.16; <i>P</i>=0.011), respectively (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.0003). Furthermore, dynamic changes in potassium were independently associated with substantial differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity risk. Potassium normalization was independently associated with lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity risk (<i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Either modeled continuously or categorically, serum potassium levels during long-term monitoring were independently associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity in patients with heart failure.

Perioperative Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) seems to be a contributor to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity after noncardiac surgery. Because the vast majority of PMIs are asymptomatic, PMI usually is missed in the absence of systematic screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a prospective diagnostic study enrolling consecutive patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who had a planned postoperative stay of ≥24 hours and were considered at increased cardiovascular risk. All patients received a systematic screening using serial measurements of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T in clinical routine. PMI was defined as an absolute high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T increase of ≥14 ng/L from preoperative to postoperative measurements. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity was compared among patients with PMI not fulfilling additional criteria (ischemic symptoms, new ECG changes, or imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium) required for the diagnosis of spontaneous acute myocardial infarction versus those that did.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 2014 to 2015 we included 2018 consecutive patients undergoing 2546 surgeries. Patients had a median age of 74 years and 42% were women. PMI occurred after 397 of 2546 surgeries (16%; 95% confidence interval, 14%–17%) and was accompanied by typical chest pain in 24 of 397 patients (6%) and any ischemic symptoms in 72 of 397 (18%). Crude 30-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7–12.0) in patients with PMI versus 1.5% (95% CI, 0.9–2.0) in patients without PMI (<i>P</i><0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.5–4.8) for 30-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity. The difference was retained at 1 year with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity rates of 22.5% (95% CI, 17.6–27.4) versus 9.3% (95% CI, 7.9–10.7). Thirty-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity was comparable among patients with PMI not fulfilling any other of the additional criteria required for spontaneous acute myocardial infarction (280/397, 71%) versus those with at least 1 additional criterion (10.4%; 95% CI, 6.7–15.7, versus 8.7%; 95% CI, 4.2–16.7; <i>P</i>=0.684).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PMI is a common complication after noncardiac surgery and, despite early detection during routine clinical screening, is associated with substantial short- and long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity seems comparable in patients with PMI not fulfilling any other of the additional criteria required for spontaneous acute myocardial infarction versus those patients who do.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type I Controls Cardiomyocyte Transforming Growth Factor-β and Cardiac Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Fibrosis is the pathological consequence of stress-induced tissue remodeling and matrix accumulation. Increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) have been shown to promote fibrosis in multiple organ systems. Paradoxically, homozygous genetic deficiency of PAI-1 is associated with spontaneous age-dependent, cardiac-selective fibrosis in mice. We have identified a novel PAI-1-dependent mechanism that regulates cardiomyocyte-derived fibrogenic signals and cardiac transcriptional pathways during injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis in subjects with homozygous mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i> was evaluated with late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A murine cardiac injury model was performed by subcutaneous infusion of either saline or Angiotensin II by osmotic minipumps. We evaluated blood pressure, cardiac function (by echocardiography), fibrosis (with Masson Trichrome staining), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s (with TUNEL staining), and we performed transcriptome analysis (with RNA sequencing). We further evaluated fibrotic signaling in isolated murine primary ventricular myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis was detected in 2 otherwise healthy humans with complete PAI-1 deficiency because of a homozygous frameshift mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i>. In addition to its suppressive role during spontaneous cardiac fibrosis in multiple species, we hypothesized that PAI-1 also regulates fibrosis during cardiac injury. Treatment of young PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice with Angiotensin II induced extensive hypertrophy and fibrotic cardiomyopathy, with increased cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s and both reactive and replacement fibrosis. Although Angiotensin II-induced hypertension was blunted in PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, cardiac hypertrophy was accelerated. Furthermore, ventricular myocytes were found to be an important source of cardiac transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and PAI-1 regulated TGF-β synthesis by cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as in vivo during cardiac injury. Transcriptome analysis of ventricular RNA after Angiotensin II treatment confirmed that PAI-1 deficiency significantly enhanced multiple TGF-β signaling elements and transcriptional targets, including genes for extracellular matrix components, mediators of extracellular matrix remodeling, matricellular proteins, and cardiac integrins compared with wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PAI-1 is an essential repressor of cardiac fibrosis in mammals. We define a novel cardiomyocyte-specific regulatory mechanism for TGF-β production by PAI-1, which explains the paradoxical effect of PAI-1 deficiency in promoting cardiac-selective fibrosis. Thus, PAI-1 is a molecular switch that controls the cardiac TGF-β axis and its early transcriptional effects that lead to myocardial fibrosis.</p></sec>

Age and Outcomes of Primary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The DANISH study (Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs [Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators] in Patients With Non-Ischemic Systolic Heart Failure on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity) did not demonstrate an overall effect on all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity with ICD implantation. However, the prespecified subgroup analysis suggested a possible age-dependent association between ICD implantation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity with survival benefit seen only in the youngest patients. The nature of this relationship between age and outcome of a primary prevention ICD in patients with nonischemic systolic heart failure warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All 1116 patients from the DANISH study were included in this prespecified subgroup analysis. We assessed the relationship between ICD implantation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity by age, and an optimal age cutoff was estimated nonparametrically with selection impact curves. Modes of death were divided into sudden cardiac death and nonsudden death and compared between patients younger and older than this age cutoff with the use of χ<sup>2</sup> analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Median age of the study population was 63 years (range, 21–84 years). There was a linearly decreasing relationship between ICD and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity with age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003–1.06; <i>P</i>=0.03). An optimal age cutoff for ICD implantation was present at ≤70 years. There was an association between reduced all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity and ICD in patients ≤70 years of age (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.96; <i>P</i>=0.03) but not in patients >70 years of age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.68–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.84). For patients ≤70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.5) and nonsudden death rate was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1–3.5) events per 100 patient-years, whereas for patients >70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8–3.2) and nonsudden death rate was 5.4 (95% CI, 3.7–7.8) events per 100 patient-years.

Potential Deaths Averted and Serious Adverse Events Incurred From Adoption of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) Intensive Blood Pressure Regimen in the United States

To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive goal implementation, we estimated the deaths prevented and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked with the National Death Index through December 2011. SPRINT eligibility included age ≥50 years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg (depending on the number of antihypertensive medications being taken), and high cardiovascular disease risk. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>, or dialysis. Annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity rates were calculated by dividing the Kaplan-Meier 5-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity by 5. Hazard ratios for all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity and heart failure and absolute risks for serious adverse events in SPRINT were used to estimate the number of potential deaths and heart failure cases prevented and serious adverse events incurred with intensive SBP treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 68.6 years, and 83.2% and 7.4% were non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, respectively. The annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity rate was 2.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91–2.48), and intensive SBP treatment was projected to prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year (95% CI, 93 300–121 200) and give rise to 56 100 (95% CI, 50 800–61 400) episodes of hypotension, 34 400 (95% CI, 31 200–37 600) episodes of syncope, 43 400 (95% CI, 39 400–47 500) serious electrolyte disorders, and 88 700 (95% CI, 80 400–97 000) cases of acute kidney injury per year. The analysis-of-extremes approach indicated that the range of estimated lower- and upper-bound number of deaths prevented per year with intensive SBP control was 34 600 to 179 600. Intensive SBP control was projected to prevent 46 100 (95% CI, 41 800–50 400) cases of heart failure annually.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>If fully implemented in eligible US adults, intensive SBP treatment could prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year.

Restricting mitochondrial GRK2 post-ischemia confers cardioprotection by reducing myocyte death and maintaining glucose oxidation
<p>Increased abundance of GRK2 [G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 2] is associated with poor cardiac function in heart failure patients. In animal models, GRK2 contributes to the pathogenesis of heart failure after ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. In addition to its role in down-regulating activated GPCRs, GRK2 also localizes to mitochondria both basally and post-IR injury, where it regulates cellular metabolism. We previously showed that phosphorylation of GRK2 at Ser<sup>670</sup> is essential for the translocation of GRK2 to the mitochondria of cardiomyocytes post-IR injury in vitro and that this localization promotes cell death. Here, we showed that mice with a S670A knock-in mutation in endogenous GRK2 showed reduced cardiomyocyte death and better cardiac function post-IR injury. Cultured GRK2-S670A knock-in cardiomyocytes subjected to IR in vitro showed enhanced glucose-mediated mitochondrial respiratory function that was partially due to maintenance of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and improved glucose oxidation. Thus, we propose that mitochondrial GRK2 plays a detrimental role in cardiac glucose oxidation post-injury.</p>

Supporting recovery from brain injury
<p>The beauty and intricacy of the human brain is unfortunately also mirrored by its vulnerability. Damage to the brain is typically permanent. Because cells of the adult brain, apart from rare exceptions, no longer divide, there is essentially no regrowth of damaged brain tissue. Acquired brain injury in the majority of cases occurs directly through traumatic events such as an accident involving a blow to the head or indirectly through interruption of the blood supply, namely a stroke. Brain injury is a major burden, with an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffering a traumatic brain injury and nearly 800,000 Americans suffering a stroke each year (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, current treatment options for such brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es are still limited and are focused on the first hours after the insult. On page 50 of this issue, Abe <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a new approach in mouse and primate models that aims to enhance the ability of the brain to regain functionality in the days and weeks after brain injury.</p>

The effect of NT-proBNP (N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide)-guided therapy in patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess whether NT-proBNP-guided therapy of patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target would lead to improved outcomes compared with conventional therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the impact of in-hospital guidance for acute decompensated HF treatment by a predefined NT-proBNP target (>30% reduction from admission to discharge) versus conventional treatment. Patients with acute decompensated HF with NT-proBNP levels >1700 ng/L were eligible. After achieving clinical stability, 405 patients were randomized to either NT-proBNP-guided or conventional treatment (1:1). The primary end point was dual: a composite of all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity and HF readmissions in 180 days and the number of days alive out of the hospital in 180 days. Secondary end points were all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity within 180 days, HF readmissions within 180 days, and a composite of all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity and HF readmissions within 90 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Significantly more patients in the NT-proBNP-guided therapy group were discharged with an NT-proBNP reduction of >30% (80% versus 64%, <i>P</i>=0.001).

Fibroblast-Specific Genetic Manipulation of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase In Vivo Reveals Its Central Regulatory Role in Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the heart, acute injury induces a fibrotic healing response that generates collagen-rich scarring that is at first protective but if inappropriately sustained can worsen heart disease. The fibrotic process is initiated by cytokines, neuroendocrine effectors, and mechanical strain that promote resident fibroblast differentiation into contractile and extracellular matrix–producing myofibroblasts. The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α (<i>Mapk14</i> gene) is known to influence the cardiac injury response, but its direct role in orchestrating programmed fibroblast differentiation and fibrosis in vivo is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A conditional <i>Mapk14</i> allele was used to delete the p38α encoding gene specifically in cardiac fibroblasts or myofibroblasts with 2 different tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase–expressing gene–targeted mouse lines. Mice were subjected to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation and monitored for survival, cardiac function, and fibrotic remodeling. Antithetically, mice with fibroblast-specific transgenic overexpression of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, a direct inducer of p38, were generated to investigate whether this pathway can directly drive myofibroblast formation and the cardiac fibrotic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In mice, loss of <i>Mapk14</i> blocked cardiac fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and ensuing fibrosis in response to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation. A similar inhibition of myofibroblast formation and healing was also observed in a dermal wounding model with deletion of <i>Mapk14</i>. Transgenic mice with fibroblast-specific activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6–p38 developed interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in the heart, lung, and kidney as a result of enhanced myofibroblast numbers. Mechanistic experiments show that p38 transduces cytokine and mechanical signals into myofibroblast differentiation through the transcription factor serum response factor and the signaling effector calcineurin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings suggest that signals from diverse modes of injury converge on p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase within the fibroblast to program the fibrotic response and myofibroblast formation in vivo, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach with p38 inhibitors for future clinical application.</p></sec>

BAG3 (Bcl-2–Associated Athanogene-3) Coding Variant in Mice Determines Susceptibility to Ischemic Limb Muscle Myopathy by Directing Autophagy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Critical limb ischemia is a manifestation of peripheral artery disease that carries significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity and morbidity risk in humans, although its genetic determinants remain largely unknown. We previously discovered 2 overlapping quantitative trait loci in mice, <i>Lsq-1</i> and <i>Civq-1</i>, that affected limb muscle survival and stroke volume after femoral artery or middle cerebral artery ligation, respectively. Here, we report that a <i>Bag3</i> variant (Ile81Met) segregates with tissue protection from hind-limb ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We treated mice with either adeno-associated viruses encoding a control (green fluorescent protein) or 2 BAG3 (Bcl-2–associated athanogene-3) variants, namely Met81 or Ile81, and subjected the mice to hind-limb ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that the BAG3 Ile81Met variant in the C57BL/6 (BL6) mouse background segregates with protection from tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s in a shorter congenic fragment of <i>Lsq-1</i> (C.B6–<i>Lsq1-3</i>). BALB/c mice treated with adeno-associated virus encoding the BL6 BAG3 variant (Ile81; n=25) displayed reduced limb-tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s and increased limb tissue perfusion compared with Met81- (n=25) or green fluorescent protein– (n=29) expressing animals. BAG3<sup>Ile81</sup>, but not BAG3<sup>Met81</sup>, improved ischemic muscle myopathy and muscle precursor cell differentiation and improved muscle regeneration in a separate, toxin-induced model of injury.

This study aimed to evaluate associations of SBP with all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity by frailty category >80 years of age and to evaluate SBP trajectories before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health records of 144 403 participants ≥80 years of age registered with family practices in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2014. Participants were followed for ≤5 years. Clinical records of SBP were analyzed. Frailty status was classified using the e-Frailty Index into the categories of fit, mild, moderate, and severe. All-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity was evaluated by frailty status and mean SBP in Cox proportional-hazards models. SBP trajectories were evaluated using person months as observations, with mean SBP and antihypertensive treatment status estimated for each person month. Fractional polynomial models were used to estimate SBP trajectories over 5 years before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During follow-up, 51 808 deaths occurred. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity rates increased with frailty level and were greatest at SBP <110 mm Hg. In fit women, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity was 7.7 per 100 person years at SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg, 15.2 at SBP 110 to 119 mm Hg, and 22.7 at SBP <110 mm Hg. For women with severe frailty, rates were 16.8, 25.2, and 39.6, respectively. SBP trajectories showed an accelerated decline in the last 2 years of life. The relative odds of SBP <120 mm Hg were higher in the last 3 months of life than 5 years previously in both treated (odds ratio, 6.06; 95% confidence interval, 5.40–6.81) and untreated (odds ratio, 6.31; 95% confidence interval, 5.30–7.52) patients. There was no evidence of intensification of antihypertensive therapy in the final 2 years of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A terminal decline of SBP in the final 2 years of life suggests that nonrandomized epidemiological associations of low SBP with higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity may be accounted for by reverse causation if participants with lower blood pressure values are closer, on average, to the end of life.</p></sec>

Two-thirds were female. Although patients were young (median age, 28 years; interquartile range, 18–40), the 2-year case fatality rate was high (500 deaths, 16.9%). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity rate was 116.3/1000 patient-years in the first year and 65.4/1000 patient-years in the second year.

Precise control of miR-125b levels is required to create a regeneration-permissive environment after spinal cord injury: a cross-species comparison between salamander and rat
<p>Most spinal cord <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es lead to permanent paralysis in mammals. By contrast, the remarkable regenerative abilities of salamanders enable full functional recovery even from complete spinal cord transections. The molecular differences underlying this evolutionary divergence between mammals and amphibians are poorly understood. We focused on upstream regulators of gene expression as primary entry points into this question. We identified a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are conserved between the Mexican axolotl salamander (<i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>) and mammals but show marked cross-species differences in regulation patterns following spinal cord injury. We found that precise post-injury levels of one of these miRNAs (miR-125b) is essential for functional recovery, and guides correct regeneration of axons through the lesion site in a process involving the direct downstream target <i>Sema4D</i> in axolotls. Translating these results to a mammalian model, we increased miR-125b levels in the rat through mimic treatments following spinal cord transection. These treatments downregulated <i>Sema4D</i> and other glial-scar-related genes, and enhanced the animal’s functional recovery. Our study identifies a key regulatory molecule conserved between salamander and mammal, and shows that the expression of <i>miR-125b</i> and <i>Sema4D</i> must be carefully controlled in the right cells at the correct level to promote regeneration. We also show that these molecular components of the salamander’s regeneration-permissive environment can be experimentally harnessed to improve treatment outcomes for mammalian spinal cord <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es.</p>

Mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate in response to traumatic bone injury in the zebrafish fin and skull
<p>Zebrafish have an unlimited capacity to regenerate bone after fin amputation. In this process, mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate to osteogenic precursor cells and thus represent an important source of newly forming bone. By contrast, differentiated osteoblasts do not appear to contribute to repair of bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es in mammals; rather, osteoblasts form anew from mesenchymal stem cells. This raises the question whether osteoblast dedifferentiation is specific to appendage regeneration, a special feature of the lepidotrichia bone of the fish fin, or a process found more generally in fish bone. Here, we show that dedifferentiation of mature osteoblasts is not restricted to fin regeneration after amputation, but also occurs during repair of zebrafish fin fractures and skull <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es. In both models, mature osteoblasts surrounding the injury downregulate the expression of differentiation markers, upregulate markers of the pre-osteoblast state and become proliferative. Making use of photoconvertible Kaede protein as well as Cre-driven genetic fate mapping, we show that osteoblasts migrate to the site of injury to replace damaged tissue. Our findings suggest a fundamental role for osteoblast dedifferentiation in reparative bone formation in fish and indicate that adult fish osteoblasts display elevated cellular plasticity compared with mammalian bone-forming cells.</p>

Epigenetic Dysregulation of the Dynamin-Related Protein 1 Binding Partners MiD49 and MiD51 Increases Mitotic Mitochondrial Fission and Promotes Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mitotic fission is increased in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a hyperproliferative, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s-resistant disease. The fission mediator dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) must complex with adaptor proteins to cause fission. Drp1-induced fission has been therapeutically targeted in experimental PAH. Here, we examine the role of 2 recently discovered, poorly understood Drp1 adapter proteins, mitochondrial dynamics protein of 49 and 51 kDa (MiD49 and MiD51), in normal vascular cells and explore their dysregulation in PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Immunoblots of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (control, n=6; PAH, n=8) and immunohistochemistry of lung sections (control, n=6; PAH, n=6) were used to assess the expression of MiD49 and MiD51. The effects of manipulating MiDs on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s were assessed in human and rodent PAH pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells with flow cytometry. Mitochondrial fission was studied by confocal imaging. A microRNA (miR) involved in the regulation of MiD expression was identified using microarray techniques and in silico analyses. The expression of circulatory miR was assessed with quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction in healthy volunteers (HVs) versus patients with PAH from Sheffield, UK (plasma: HV, n=29, PAH, n=27; whole blood: HV, n=11, PAH, n=14) and then confirmed in a cohort from Beijing, China (plasma: HV, n=19, PAH, n=36; whole blood: HV, n=20, PAH, n=39). This work was replicated in monocrotaline and Sugen 5416-hypoxia, preclinical PAH models. Small interfering RNAs targeting MiDs or an miR mimic were nebulized to rats with monocrotaline-induced PAH (n=4–10).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MiD expression is increased in PAH pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, which accelerates Drp1-mediated mitotic fission, increases cell proliferation, and decreases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s. Silencing MiDs (but not other Drp1 binding partners, fission 1 or mitochondrial fission factor) promotes mitochondrial fusion and causes G1-phase cell cycle arrest through extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2– and cyclin-dependent kinase 4–dependent mechanisms. Augmenting MiDs in normal cells causes fission and recapitulates the PAH phenotype. MiD upregulation results from decreased miR-34a-3p expression. Circulatory miR-34a-3p expression is decreased in both patients with PAH and preclinical models of PAH. Silencing MiDs or augmenting miR-34a-3p regresses experimental PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In health, MiDs regulate Drp1-mediated fission, whereas in disease, epigenetic upregulation of MiDs increases mitotic fission, which drives pathological proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s resistance.

On multivariable modeling, lower-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process measures than higher-volume hospitals. Higher hospital volume was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher volumes with lower 6-month <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective national quality improvement registry of older patients with HF indicates that hospital volume as a structural metric correlates with process measures, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up. Hospital profiling should focus on participation in systems of care, adherence to process metrics, and risk-standardized outcomes rather than on hospital volume itself.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Outcomes and Risks After Initiation of a Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials have shown cardiovascular benefits and potential risks from sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Trials may have limited ability to address individual end points or safety concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a population-based cohort study among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease newly initiated on antihyperglycemic agents within the US Department of Defense Military Health System between April 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016. Incidence rates, hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time to first composite end point of all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity and hospitalization for heart failure event, major adverse cardiovascular events (defined as all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke), and individual end points were evaluated using conditional Cox models comparing new SGLT2i users with other antihyperglycemic agents. The exploratory safety end point was below-knee lower extremity amputation. Intent-to-treat and on-treatment analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After propensity matching, 25 258 patients were followed for a median of 1.6 years. Compared with non-SGLT2i, initiation of SGLT2i was associated with a lower rate of all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity and hospitalization for heart failure (1.73 versus 3.01 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50–0.65) and major adverse cardiovascular events (2.31 versus 3.45 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60–0.75). SGLT2i initiation was also associated with an ≈2-fold higher risk of below-knee lower extremity amputation (0.17 versus 0.09 events per 100 person-years; HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12–3.51). Because of the disproportionate canagliflozin exposure in the database, the majority of amputations were observed on canagliflozin. Results were consistent in the on-treatment analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this high-risk cohort, initiation of SGLT2i was associated with lower risk of all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity, hospitalization for heart failure, and major adverse cardiovascular events and higher risk of below-knee lower extremity amputation. Findings underscore the potential benefit and risks to be aware of when initiating SGLT2i. It remains unclear whether the below-knee lower extremity amputation risk extends across the class of medication, because the study was not powered to make comparisons among individual treatments.</p></sec>

Functional Metabolomics Characterizes a Key Role for <i>N</i>-Acetylneuraminic Acid in Coronary Artery Diseases
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>As new biomarkers of coronary artery diseases (CAD) emerge via metabolomics, the underlying functional mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Functional metabolomics aims to translate metabolomics-derived biomarkers to disease mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A cohort of 2324 patients who underwent coronary angiography from 4 independent centers was studied. A combination of ultra–performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode was used for untargeted analysis of metabolites in plasma. Significant differential metabolites were identified by cross-comparisons with and within CAD types, including normal coronary artery, nonobstructvie coronary atherosclerosis, stable angina, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction. A tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry–based approach using isotope-labeled standard addition was subsequently performed for targeted analysis of the metabolic marker <i>N</i>-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). A functional metabolomics strategy was proposed to investigate the role of Neu5Ac in the progression of CAD by using in vitro and in vivo models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified a total of 36 differential metabolites, 35 of which were confirmed with reference compounds. Elevation of Neu5Ac was observed in plasma during CAD progression in center 1 (<i>P</i>=4.0e-64, n=2019) and replicated in 3 independent centers (n=305). The increased level of Neu5Ac in plasma was confirmed by accurate targeted quantification. Mechanistically, Neu5Ac was able to trigger myocardial injury in vitro and in vivo by activation of the Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase signaling pathway through binding to RhoA and Cdc42, but not Rac1. Silencing neuraminidase-1, the enzyme that regulates Neu5Ac generation, ameliorated oxygen-glucose deprivation–induced injury in cardiomyocytes and ligation/isoprenaline-induced myocardial ischemia injury in rats. Pharmacological inhibition of neuraminidase by anti-influenza drugs, oseltamivir and zanamivir, also protected cardiomyocytes and the heart from myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Functional metabolomics identified a key role for Neu5Ac in acute myocardial infarction, and targeting neuraminidase-1 may represent an unrecognized therapeutic intervention for CAD.</p></sec>

Body Mass Index and Mortality Among Adults Undergoing Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In an apparent paradox, morbidity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity are lower in obese patients undergoing cardiac surgery, although the nature of this association is unclear. We sought to determine whether the obesity paradox observed in cardiac surgery is attributable to reverse epidemiology, bias, or confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the National Adult Cardiac Surgery registry for all cardiac surgical procedures performed between April 2002 and March 2013 were extracted. A parallel systematic review and meta-analysis (MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library) through June 2015 were also accomplished. Exposure of interest was body mass index categorized into 6 groups according to the World Health Organization classification.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 401 227 adult patients in the cohort study and 557 720 patients in the systematic review were included. A U-shaped association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity and body mass index classes was observed in both studies, with lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity in overweight (adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.83) and obese class I and II (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.86; and odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.94) patients relative to normal-weight patients and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity in underweight individuals (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.41–1.62). In the cohort study, a U-shaped relationship was observed for stroke and low cardiac output syndrome but not for renal replacement therapy or deep sternal wound infection. Counter to the reverse epidemiology hypotheses, the protective effects of obesity were less in patients with severe chronic renal, lung, or cardiac disease and greater in older patients and in those with complications of obesity, including the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. Adjustments for important confounders did not alter our results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Obesity is associated with lower risks after cardiac surgery, with consistent effects noted in multiple analyses attempting to address residual confounding and reverse causation.</p></sec>

Prevalence, Incidence, and Mortality of Stroke in China
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>China bears the biggest stroke burden in the world. However, little is known about the current prevalence, incidence, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity of stroke at the national level, and the trend in the past 30 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 2013, a nationally representative door-to-door survey was conducted in 155 urban and rural centers in 31 provinces in China, totaling 480 687 adults aged ≥20 years. All stroke survivors were considered as prevalent stroke cases at the prevalent time (August 31, 2013). First-ever strokes that occurred during 1 year preceding the survey point-prevalent time were considered as incident cases. According to computed tomography/MRI/autopsy findings, strokes were categorized into ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke of undetermined type.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 480 687 participants, 7672 were diagnosed with a prevalent stroke (1596.0/100 000 people) and 1643 with incident strokes (345.1/100 000 person-years). The age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity rates were 1114.8/100 000 people, 246.8 and 114.8/100 000 person-years, respectively. Pathological type of stroke was documented by computed tomography/MRI brain scanning in 90% of prevalent and 83% of incident stroke cases. Among incident and prevalent strokes, ischemic stroke constituted 69.6% and 77.8%, intracerebral hemorrhage 23.8% and 15.8%, subarachnoid hemorrhage 4.4% and 4.4%, and undetermined type 2.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Age-specific stroke prevalence in men aged ≥40 years was significantly greater than the prevalence in women (<i>P</i><0.001). The most prevalent risk factors among stroke survivors were hypertension (88%), smoking (48%), and alcohol use (44%). Stroke prevalence estimates in 2013 were statistically greater than those reported in China 3 decades ago, especially among rural residents (<i>P</i>=0.017). The highest annual incidence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity of stroke was in Northeast (365 and 159/100 000 person-years), then Central areas (326 and 154/100 000 person-years), and the lowest incidence was in Southwest China (154/100 000 person-years), and the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity was in South China (65/100 000 person-years) (<i>P</i><0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Stroke burden in China has increased over the past 30 years, and remains particularly high in rural areas. There is a north-to-south gradient in stroke in China, with the greatest stroke burden observed in the northern and central regions.</p></sec>

Recurrent Hospitalization Among Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Intracoronary Stenting Treated With 2 Treatment Strategies of Rivaroxaban or a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment Strategy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with atrial fibrillation who undergo intracoronary stenting traditionally are treated with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) plus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), yet this treatment leads to high risks of bleeding. We hypothesized that a regimen of rivaroxaban plus a P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor monotherapy or rivaroxaban plus DAPT could reduce bleeding and thereby have a favorable impact on all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity and the need for rehospitalization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Stented subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (n=2124) were randomized 1:1:1 to administration of reduced-dose rivaroxaban 15 mg daily plus a P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor for 12 months (group 1); rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily with stratification to a prespecified duration of DAPT of 1, 6, or 12 months (group 2); or the reference arm of dose-adjusted VKA daily with a similar DAPT stratification (group 3). The present post hoc analysis assessed the end point of all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity or recurrent hospitalization for an adverse event, which was further classified as the result of bleeding, a cardiovascular cause, or another cause blinded to treatment assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The risk of all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity or recurrent hospitalization was 34.9% in group 1 (hazard ratio=0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.008 versus group 3; number needed to treat=15), 31.9% in group 2 (hazard ratio=0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.90; <i>P</i>=0.002 versus group 3; number needed to treat=10), and 41.9% in group 3 (VKA+DAPT). Both all-cause death plus hospitalization potentially resulting from bleeding (group 1=8.6% [<i>P</i>=0.032 versus group 3], group 2=8.0% [<i>P</i>=0.012 versus group 3], and group 3=12.4%) and all-cause death plus rehospitalization potentially resulting from a cardiovascular cause (group 1=21.4% [<i>P</i>=0.001 versus group 3], group 2=21.7% [<i>P</i>=0.011 versus group 3], and group 3=29.3%) were reduced in the rivaroxaban arms compared with the VKA arm, but other forms of rehospitalization were not.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing intracoronary stenting, administration of either rivaroxaban 15 mg daily plus P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor monotherapy or 2.5 mg rivaroxaban twice daily plus DAPT was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</span></strong>ity or recurrent hospitalization for adverse events compared with standard-of-care VKA plus DAPT.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

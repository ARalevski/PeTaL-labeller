Decoys Untangle Complicated Redundancy and Reveal Targets of Circadian Clock F-Box Proteins
<p>Eukaryotic circadian clocks utilize the ubiquitin proteasome system to precisely degrade clock proteins. In plants, the F-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligases ZEITLUPE (ZTL), FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX1 (FKF1), and LOV KELCH PROTEIN2 (LKP2) regulate clock period and couple the clock to photoperiodic flowering in response to end-of-day light conditions. To better understand their functions, we expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decoy</span></strong> ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 proteins that associate with target proteins but are unable to ubiquitylate their targets in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). These dominant-negative forms of the proteins inhibit the ubiquitylation of target proteins and allow for the study of ubiquitylation-independent and -dependent functions of ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2. We demonstrate the effects of expressing ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decoy</span></strong>s on the circadian clock and flowering time. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decoy</span></strong> E3 ligases trap substrate interactions, and using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, we identify interacting partners. We focus studies on the clock transcription factor CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE) and show that ZTL interacts directly with CHE and can mediate CHE ubiquitylation. We also demonstrate that CHE protein is degraded in the dark and that degradation is reduced in a <i>ztl</i> mutant plant, showing that CHE is a bona fide ZTL target protein. This work increases our understanding of the genetic and biochemical roles for ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 and also demonstrates an effective methodology for studying complicated genetic redundancy among E3 ubiquitin ligases.</p>

MEG3-4 is a miRNA decoy that regulates IL-1β abundance to initiate and then limit inflammation to prevent sepsis during lung infection
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression. We investigated the role of lncRNAs in the inflammatory response to bacterial infection in the lungs. We identified the lncRNA MEG3 as a tissue-specific modulator of inflammatory responses during bacterial infection. Among the 10 transcript isoforms of MEG3, transcript 4 (referred to as MEG3-4) encodes the isoform with the lowest abundance in mouse lungs. Nonetheless, we found that MEG3-4 bound to the microRNA miR-138 in a competitive manner with mRNA encoding the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), thereby increasing IL-1β abundance and intensifying inflammatory responses to bacterial infection in alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells in culture and in lung tissue in mice. MEG3-4–mediated sponging of miR-138 in the cytoplasm increased the autocrine activity of IL-1β that subsequently induced a negative feedback mechanism mediated by nuclear factor κB that decreased MEG3-4 abundance and inflammatory cytokine production. This timely reduction in MEG3-4 abundance tempered proinflammatory responses in mice with pulmonary bacterial infection, preventing the progression to sepsis. Together, these findings reveal that MEG3-4 dynamically modulates pulmonary inflammatory responses through transcriptional regulation of immune response genes, extending the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decoy</span></strong> and sponge mechanism associated with lncRNAs to antibacterial immunity, which affects both response and disease progression.</p>

URI is required to maintain intestinal architecture during ionizing radiation
<p>Ionizing radiation (IR) can cause gastrointestinal syndrome (GIS), a lethal disorder, by means of unknown mechanisms. We show that high-dose irradiation increases unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI) levels in mouse intestinal crypt, but organ regeneration correlates with URI reductions. URI overexpression in intestine protects mice from radiation-induced GIS, whereas halving URI expression sensitizes mice to IR. URI specifically inhibits β-catenin in stem cell–like label-retaining (LR) cells, which are essential for organ regeneration after IR. URI reduction activates β-catenin–induced c-MYC expression, causing proliferation of and DNA damage to LR cells, rendering them radiosensitive. Therefore, URI labels LR cells which promote tissue regeneration in response to high-dose irradiation, and c-MYC inhibitors could be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">countermeasur</span></strong>es for humans at risk of developing GIS.</p>

The Global Virome Project
<p>Outbreaks of novel and deadly viruses highlight global vulnerability to emerging diseases, with many having massive health and economic impacts. Our adaptive toolkit—based largely on vaccines and therapeutics—is often ineffective because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">countermeasur</span></strong>e development can be outpaced by the speed of novel viral emergence and spread. Following each outbreak, the public health community bemoans a lack of prescience, but after decades of reacting to each event with little focus on mitigation, we remain only marginally better protected against the next epidemic. Our ability to mitigate disease emergence is undermined by our poor understanding of the diversity and ecology of viral threats, and of the drivers of their emergence. We describe a Global Virome Project (GVP) aimed to launch in 2018 that will help identify the bulk of this viral threat and provide timely data for public health interventions against future pandemics.</p>

Atomic structure of the human cytomegalovirus capsid with its securing tegument layer of pp150
<p>Herpesviruses possess a genome-pressurized capsid. The 235-kilobase genome of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is by far the largest of any herpesvirus, yet it has been unclear how its capsid, which is similar in size to those of other herpesviruses, is stabilized. Here we report a HCMV atomic structure consisting of the herpesvirus-conserved capsid proteins MCP, Tri1, Tri2, and SCP and the HCMV-specific tegument protein pp150—totaling ~4000 molecules and 62 different conformers. MCPs manifest as a complex of insertions around a bacteriophage HK97 gp5–like domain, which gives rise to three classes of capsid floor–defining interactions; triplexes, composed of two “embracing” Tri2 conformers and a “third-wheeling” Tri1, fasten the capsid floor. HCMV-specific strategies include using hexon channels to accommodate the genome and pp150 helix bundles to secure the capsid via cysteine tetrad–to-SCP interactions. Our structure should inform rational design of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">countermeasur</span></strong>es against HCMV, other herpesviruses, and even HIV/AIDS.</p>

A paralogous decoy protects <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> apoplastic effector PsXEG1 from a host inhibitor
<p>The extracellular space (apoplast) of plant tissue represents a critical battleground between plants and attacking microbes. Here we show that a pathogen-secreted apoplastic xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase, PsXEG1, is a focus of this struggle in the <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>–soybean interaction. We show that soybean produces an apoplastic glucanase inhibitor protein, GmGIP1, that binds to PsXEG1 to block its contribution to virulence. <i>P. sojae</i>, however, secretes a paralogous PsXEG1-like protein, PsXLP1, that has lost enzyme activity but binds to GmGIP1 more tightly than does PsXEG1, thus freeing PsXEG1 to support <i>P. sojae</i> infection. The gene pair encoding PsXEG1 and PsXLP1 is conserved in many <i>Phytophthora</i> species, and the <i>P. parasitica</i> orthologs PpXEG1 and PpXLP1 have similar functions. Thus, this apoplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decoy</span></strong> strategy may be widely used in <i>Phytophthora</i> pathosystems.</p>

Turnip Mosaic Virus Counteracts Selective Autophagy of the Viral Silencing Suppressor HCpro<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway and has emerged as a key mechanism of antiviral immunity in metazoans, including the selective elimination of viral components. In turn, some animal viruses are able to escape and modulate autophagy for enhanced pathogenicity. Whether host autophagic responses and viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">countermeasur</span></strong>es play similar roles in plant-virus interactions is not well understood. Here, we have identified selective autophagy as antiviral pathway during plant infection with turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), a positive-stranded RNA potyvirus. We show that the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 suppresses viral accumulation by targeting the viral RNA silencing suppressor helper-component proteinase (HCpro), presumably in association with virus-induced RNA granules. Intriguingly, TuMV seems to antagonize NBR1-dependent autophagy during infection by the activity of distinct viral proteins, thereby limiting its antiviral capacity. We also found that NBR1-independent bulk autophagy prevents premature plant death, thus extending the lifespan of virus reservoirs and particle production. Together, our study highlights a conserved role of selective autophagy in antiviral immunity and suggests the evolvement of viral protein functions to inhibit autophagy processes, despite a potential trade-off in host survival.</p>

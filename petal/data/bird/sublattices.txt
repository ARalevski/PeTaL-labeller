The epidemiology and trends in management of acute Achilles tendon ruptures in Ontario, Canada
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to establish the incidence of acute   Achilles tendon rupture (AATR) in a North American population, to   select demographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s and to examine trends in the management   of this injury in the province of Ontario, Canada.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients ≥ 18 years of age who presented with an AATR to an emergency   department in Ontario, Canada between 1 January 2003 and 31 December   2013 were identified using administrative databases. The overall   and annual incidence density rate (IDR) of AATR were calculated   for all demographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s. The annual rate of surgical repair   was also calculated and compared between demographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 27 607 patients (median age, 44 years; interquartile   range 26 to 62; 66.5% male) sustained an AATR. The annual IDR increased   from 18.0 to 29.3 per 100 000 person-years between 2003 and 2013.   The mean IDR was highest among men between the ages of 40 and 49   years (46.0/100 000 person-years). The annual rate of surgical repair dropped   from 20.1 in 2003 to 9.2 per 100 AATRs in 2013. There was a noticeable   decline after 2009.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The incidence of AATR is increasing in Ontario, while the annual   rate of surgical repair is decreasing. A sharp decline in the rate   of surgical repair was noted after 2009. This coincided with the   publication of several high-quality RCTs which showed similar outcomes   for the ‘functional’ non-operative management and surgical repair.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:78–86.</p></sec>

Effect of Losartan on Right Ventricular Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers on right ventricular (RV) function is still unknown. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are beneficial in patients with acquired left ventricular dysfunction, and recent findings have suggested a favorable effect in symptomatic patients with systemic RV dysfunction. The current study aimed to determine the effect of losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, on subpulmonary RV dysfunction in adults after repaired tetralogy of Fallot.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The REDEFINE trial (Right Ventricular Dysfunction in Tetralogy of Fallot: Inhibition of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot and RV dysfunction (RV ejection fraction [EF] <50%) but without severe valvular dysfunction were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned between losartan (150 mg daily) and placebo with target treatment duration between 18 and 24 months. The primary outcome was RV EF change, determined by cardiovascular MRI in intention-to-treat analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 95 included patients, 47 patients received 150 mg losartan daily (age, 38.0±12.4 years; 74% male), and 48 patients received placebo (age, 40.6±11.4 years; 63% male). Overall, RV EF did not change in patients allocated to losartan (n=42) (44.4±5.1% to 45.2±5.0%) and placebo (n=46) (43.2±6.3% to 43.6±6.9%). Losartan did not significantly improve RV EF in comparison with placebo (+0.51%; 95% confidence interval, –1.0 to +2.0; <i>P</i>=0.50). No significant treatment effects were found on secondary outcomes: left ventricular EF, peak aerobic exercise capacity, and N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide (<i>P</i>>0.30 for all). In predefined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analyses, losartan did not have a statistically significant impact on RV EF in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s with symptoms, restrictive RV, RV EF<40%, pulmonary valve replacement, or QRS fragmentation. However, in a post hoc analysis, losartan was associated with improved RV EF in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> (n=30) with nonrestrictive RV and incomplete remodeling (QRS fragmentation and previous pulmonary valve replacement) (+2.7%; 95% confidence interval, +0.1 to +5.4; <i>P</i>=0.045).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Losartan had no significant effect on RV dysfunction or secondary outcome parameters in repaired tetralogy of Fallot. Future larger studies may determine whether there might be a role for losartan in specific vulnerable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Transcriptional repressor REST drives lineage stage–specific chromatin compaction at <i>Ptch1</i> and increases AKT activation in a mouse model of medulloblastoma
<p>In medulloblastomas (MBs), the expression and activity of RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) is increased in tumors driven by the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway, specifically the SHH-α (children 3 to 16 years) and SHH-β (infants) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s. Neuronal maturation is greater in SHH-β than SHH-α tumors, but both correlate with poor overall patient survival. We studied the contribution of REST to MB using a transgenic mouse model (<i>RESTTG</i><sup></sup>) wherein conditional <i>NeuroD2</i>-controlled <i>REST</i> transgene expression in lineage-committed <i>Ptch1</i><sup>+/−</sup> cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) accelerated tumorigenesis and increased penetrance and infiltrative disease. This model revealed a neuronal maturation context–specific antagonistic interplay between the transcriptional repressor REST and the activator GLI1 at <i>Ptch1</i>. Expression of <i>Arrb1</i>, which encodes β-arrestin1 (a GLI1 inhibitor), was substantially reduced in proliferating and, to a lesser extent, lineage-committed <i>RESTTG</i><sup></sup> cells compared with wild-type proliferating CGNPs. Lineage-committed <i>REST<sup>TG</sup></i> cells also had decreased GLI1 activity and increased histone H3K9 methylation at the <i>Ptch1</i> locus, which correlated with premature silencing of <i>Ptch1</i>. These cells also had decreased expression of <i>Pten</i>, which encodes a negative regulator of the kinase AKT. Expression of <i>PTCH1</i> and <i>GLI1</i> were less, and <i>ARRB1</i> was somewhat greater, in patient SHH-β than SHH-α MBs, whereas that of <i>PTEN</i> was similarly lower in both subtypes than in others. Inhibition of histone modifiers or AKT reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis, respectively, in cultured REST-high MB cells. Our findings linking REST to differentiation-specific chromatin remodeling, <i>PTCH1</i> silencing, and AKT activation in MB tissues reveal potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>-specific therapeutic targets for MB patients.</p>

Age and Outcomes of Primary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The DANISH study (Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs [Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators] in Patients With Non-Ischemic Systolic Heart Failure on Mortality) did not demonstrate an overall effect on all-cause mortality with ICD implantation. However, the prespecified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analysis suggested a possible age-dependent association between ICD implantation and mortality with survival benefit seen only in the youngest patients. The nature of this relationship between age and outcome of a primary prevention ICD in patients with nonischemic systolic heart failure warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All 1116 patients from the DANISH study were included in this prespecified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analysis. We assessed the relationship between ICD implantation and mortality by age, and an optimal age cutoff was estimated nonparametrically with selection impact curves. Modes of death were divided into sudden cardiac death and nonsudden death and compared between patients younger and older than this age cutoff with the use of χ<sup>2</sup> analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Median age of the study population was 63 years (range, 21–84 years). There was a linearly decreasing relationship between ICD and mortality with age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003–1.06; <i>P</i>=0.03). An optimal age cutoff for ICD implantation was present at ≤70 years. There was an association between reduced all-cause mortality and ICD in patients ≤70 years of age (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.96; <i>P</i>=0.03) but not in patients >70 years of age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.68–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.84). For patients ≤70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.5) and nonsudden death rate was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1–3.5) events per 100 patient-years, whereas for patients >70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8–3.2) and nonsudden death rate was 5.4 (95% CI, 3.7–7.8) events per 100 patient-years. This difference in modes of death between the 2 age groups was statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with systolic heart failure not caused by ischemic heart disease, the association between the ICD and survival decreased linearly with increasing age. In this study population, an age cutoff for ICD implantation at ≤70 years yielded the highest survival for the population as a whole.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thrombus aspiration during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been widely used; however, recent trials have questioned its value and safety. In this meta-analysis, we, the trial investigators, aimed to pool the individual patient data from these trials to determine the benefits and risks of thrombus aspiration during PCI in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Included were large (n≥1000), randomized, controlled trials comparing manual thrombectomy and PCI alone in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. Individual patient data were provided by the leadership of each trial. The prespecified primary efficacy outcome was cardiovascular mortality within 30 days, and the primary safety outcome was stroke or transient ischemic attack within 30 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 3 eligible randomized trials (TAPAS [Thrombus Aspiration During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction], TASTE [Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Scandinavia], and TOTAL [Trial of Routine Aspiration Thrombectomy With PCI Versus PCI Alone in Patients With STEMI]) enrolled 19 047 patients, of whom 18 306 underwent PCI and were included in the primary analysis. Cardiovascular death at 30 days occurred in 221 of 9155 patients (2.4%) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 262 of 9151 (2.9%) randomized to PCI alone (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.06). Stroke or transient ischemic attack occurred in 66 (0.8%) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 46 (0.5%) randomized to PCI alone (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–2.10; <i>P</i>=0.06). There were no significant differences in recurrent myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, heart failure, or target vessel revascularization. In the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> with high thrombus burden (TIMI [Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction] thrombus grade ≥3), thrombus aspiration was associated with fewer cardiovascular deaths (170 [2.5%] versus 205 [3.1%]; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.03) and with more strokes or transient ischemic attacks (55 [0.9%] versus 34 [0.5%]; odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–2.42, <i>P</i>=0.04). However, the interaction <i>P</i> values were 0.32 and 0.34, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Routine thrombus aspiration during PCI for ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction did not improve clinical outcomes. In the high thrombus burden group, the trends toward reduced cardiovascular death and increased stroke or transient ischemic attack provide a rationale for future trials of improved thrombus aspiration technologies in this high-risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URLs: <ext-link>http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> <ext-link>http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/</ext-link>.

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative risk reduction with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative risk reduction among a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> at high genetic risk. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high genetic risk had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic risk score derived from up to 57 common DNA sequence variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high genetic risk (top quintile of polygenic risk score) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic risk score and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high genetic risk, statin therapy was associated with a relative risk reduction of 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22–60; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas in all others, the relative risk reduction was 24% (95% CI, 8–37; <i>P</i>=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary prevention, relative risk reduction in those at high genetic risk was 46% versus 26% in all others (<i>P</i> for heterogeneity=0.05). Across all 3 studies, the absolute risk reduction with statin therapy was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.0–5.1) among those in the high genetic risk group and 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6–1.9) in all others. Each 1-SD increase in the polygenic risk score was associated with 1.32-fold (95% CI, 1.04–1.68) greater likelihood of having coronary artery calcification and 9.7% higher (95% CI, 2.2–17.8) burden of carotid plaque.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Those at high genetic risk have a greater burden of subclinical atherosclerosis and derive greater relative and absolute benefit from statin therapy to prevent a first coronary heart disease event.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Sources of Sodium in US Adults From 3 Geographic Regions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US adults consume excess sodium. Knowledge about the dietary sources of sodium intake is critical to the development of effective reduction strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 450 adults were recruited from 3 geographic locations: Birmingham, AL (n=150); Palo Alto, CA (n=150); and the Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN (n=150), metropolitan areas. Equal numbers of women and men from each of 4 race/ethnic groups (blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites) were targeted for recruitment. Four record-assisted 24-hour dietary recalls were collected from each participant with special procedures, which included the collection of duplicate samples of salt added to food at the table and in home food preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Sodium added to food outside the home was the leading source of sodium, accounting for more than two thirds (70.9%) of total sodium intake in the sample. Although the proportion of sodium from this source was smaller in some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s, it was the leading contributor for all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s. Contribution ranged from 66.3% for those with a high school level of education or less to 75.0% for those 18 to 29 years of age. Sodium inherent to food was the next highest contributor (14.2%), followed by salt added in home food preparation (5.6%) and salt added to food at the table (4.9%). Home tap water consumed as a beverage and dietary supplement and nonprescription antacids contributed minimally to sodium intake (<0.5% each).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Sodium added to food outside the home accounted for ≈70% of dietary sodium intake.

Direct Comparison of 4 Very Early Rule-Out Strategies for Acute Myocardial Infarction Using High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Four strategies for very early rule-out of acute myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) have been identified. It remains unclear which strategy is most attractive for clinical application.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively enrolled unselected patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. The final diagnosis was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists. Hs-cTnI levels were measured at presentation and after 1 hour in a blinded fashion. We directly compared all 4 hs-cTnI–based rule-out strategies: limit of detection (LOD, hs-cTnI<2 ng/L), single cutoff (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L), 1-hour algorithm (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L and 1-hour change<2 ng/L), and the 0/1-hour algorithm recommended in the European Society of Cardiology guideline combining LOD and 1-hour algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 2828 enrolled patients, acute myocardial infarction was the final diagnosis in 451 (16%) patients. The LOD approach ruled out 453 patients (16%) with a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 99.2%–100%), the single cutoff 1516 patients (54%) with a sensitivity of 97.1% (95% CI, 95.1%–98.3%), the 1-hour algorithm 1459 patients (52%) with a sensitivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%), and the 0/1-hour algorithm 1463 patients (52%) with a sensitivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%). Predefined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analysis in early presenters (≤2 hours) revealed significantly lower sensitivity (94.2%, interaction <i>P</i>=0.03) of the single cutoff, but not the other strategies.

Gall induction may benefit host plant: a case of a gall wasp and eucalyptus tree
<p>Gall-inducing insects display intimate interactions with their host plants, usually described as parasitic relationships; the galls seem to favor the galler alone. We report on a case in which the presence of the galls induced by <i>Leptocybe invasa</i> Fisher & LaSalle (Hymenoptera; Eulophidae) benefit its host plant, the river red gum <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh. Field observations showed that <i>E. camaldulensis</i> plants infected by this gall wasp were less susceptible to cold injury than neighboring conspecific plants without galls. In the laboratory, frost resistance was compared between galled and non-galled plants which were both divided into two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s: cold-acclimated plants and plants that were non-acclimated. Galled plants displayed higher frost resistance than the non-galled ones, and the differences were higher in non-acclimated plants compared with acclimated ones. Physiological changes in host plant were determined by chemical analyses of chlorophylls, proteins, soluble sugars and anthocyanin contents. The results showed higher values of all physiological parameters in the galled plants, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of the gall wasp induces physiological changes on the plant foliage, which may in turn increase plant defense mechanisms against cold. Therefore, the toll of galling by the herbivore may pay off by the host plant acquiring increased frost resistance. This work provides evidence for physiological changes induced by a herbivore which might have a positive indirect effect on the host plant, promoting frost resistance such as cold acclimation.</p>

How the news media activate public expression and influence national agendas
<p>We demonstrate that exposure to the news media causes Americans to take public stands on specific issues, join national policy conversations, and express themselves publicly—all key components of democratic politics—more often than they would otherwise. After recruiting 48 mostly small media outlets, we chose groups of these outlets to write and publish articles on subjects we approved, on dates we randomly assigned. We estimated the causal effect on proximal measures, such as website pageviews and Twitter discussion of the articles’ specific subjects, and distal ones, such as national Twitter conversation in broad policy areas. Our intervention increased discussion in each broad policy area by ~62.7% (relative to a day’s volume), accounting for 13,166 additional posts over the treatment week, with similar effects across population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s.</p>

Loss of LOFSEP Transcription Factor Function Converts Spikelet to Leaf-Like Structures in Rice
<p><i>SEPALLATA</i> (<i>SEP</i>)-like genes, which encode a subfamily of MADS-box transcription factors, are essential for specifying floral organ and meristem identity in angiosperms. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) has five <i>SEP</i>-like genes with partial redundancy and overlapping expression domains, yet their functions and evolutionary conservation are only partially known. Here, we describe the biological role of one of the <i>SEP</i> genes of rice, <i>OsMADS5</i>, in redundantly controlling spikelet morphogenesis. <i>OsMADS5</i> belongs to the conserved <i>LOFSEP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> along with <i>OsMADS1</i> and <i>OsMADS34</i>. <i>OsMADS5</i> was expressed strongly across a broad range of reproductive stages and tissues. No obvious phenotype was observed in the <i>osmads5</i> single mutants when compared with the wild type, which was largely due to the functional redundancy among the three <i>LOFSEP</i> genes. Genetic and molecular analyses demonstrated that <i>OsMADS1</i>, <i>OsMADS5</i>, and <i>OsMADS34</i> together regulate floral meristem determinacy and specify the identities of spikelet organs by positively regulating the other MADS-box floral homeotic genes. Experiments conducted in yeast also suggested that OsMADS1, OsMADS5, and OsMADS34 form protein-protein interactions with other MADS-box floral homeotic members, which seems to be a typical, conserved feature of plant SEP proteins.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to transfer their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing carotenoid transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

LNK1 and LNK2 Corepressors Interact with the MYB3 Transcription Factor in Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Subgroup 4 of R2R3-MYB transcription factors consists of four members, MYB3, MYB4, MYB7, and MYB32, which possess the conserved EAR repression motif (pdLHLD/LLxiG/S) in their C termini. Here, we show that MYB3 is a newly identified repressor in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. However, the repression mechanism of MYB3 is completely different from MYB4, MYB7, and MYB32. Yeast two-hybrid screening using MYB3 as a bait isolates NIGHT LIGHT-INDUCIBLE AND CLOCK-REGULATED1 (LNK1) and LNK2, members of a small family of four LNK proteins. The repression activity of MYB3 to cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (<i>C4H</i>) gene expression is directly regulated by corepressors LNK1 and LNK2, which could facilitate binding of MYB3 with <i>C4H</i> promoter. The two conserved Asp residues in both region 1 and 2 domain of LNKs are essential to mediate protein-protein interaction. Importantly, the Extra N-terminal Tail domain plays a negative role in LNK-MYB3 transcription complex-dependent repression of the <i>C4H</i> gene. We conclude that LNK1 and LNK2 act as transcriptional corepressors necessary for expression of the phenylpropanoids biosynthesis gene <i>C4H</i> through recruitment to its promoter via interaction with MYB3.</p>

Selection for a Zinc-Finger Protein Contributes to Seed Oil Increase during Soybean Domestication
<p>Seed oil is a momentous agronomical trait of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) targeted by domestication in breeding. Although multiple oil-related genes have been uncovered, knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of seed oil biosynthesis is currently limited. We demonstrate that the seed-preferred gene <i>GmZF351</i>, encoding a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein, is selected during domestication. Further analysis shows that <i>GmZF351</i> facilitates oil accumulation by directly activating <i>WRINKLED1</i>, <i>BIOTIN CARBOXYL CARRIER PROTEIN2</i>, <i>3-KETOACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN SYNTHASE III</i>, <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i>, and <i>OLEOSIN2</i> in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds. Overexpression of <i>GmZF351</i> in transgenic soybean also activates lipid biosynthesis genes, thereby accelerating seed oil accumulation. The <i>ZF351</i> haplotype from the cultivated soybean group and the wild soybean (<i>Glycine soja</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> III correlates well with high gene expression level, seed oil contents and promoter activity, suggesting that selection of <i>GmZF351</i> expression leads to increased seed oil content in cultivated soybean. Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for seed oil accumulation, and the manipulation of <i>GmZF351</i> may have great potential in the improvement of oil production in soybean and other related crops.</p>

Moving without a purpose: an experimental study of swarm guidance in the Western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>
<p>During reproductive swarming, honey bee scouts perform two very important functions. Firstly, they find new nesting locations and return to the swarm cluster to communicate their discoveries. Secondly, once the swarm is ready to depart, informed scout bees act as guides, leading the swarm to its final destination. We have previously hypothesised that the two processes, selecting a new nest site and swarm guidance, are tightly linked in honey bees. When swarms can be <i>laissez faire</i> about where they nest, reaching directional consensus prior to lift off seems unnecessary. If, in contrast, it is essential that the swarm reaches a precise location, either directional consensus must be near unanimous prior to swarm departure or only a select <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> of the scouts guide the swarm. Here, we tested experimentally whether directional consensus is necessary for the successful guidance of swarms of the Western honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i> by forcing swarms into the air prior to the completion of the decision-making process. Our results show that swarms were unable to guide themselves prior to the swarm reaching the pre-flight buzzing phase of the decision-making process, even when directional consensus was high. We therefore suggest that not all scouts involved in the decision-making process attempt to guide the swarm.</p>

The medium- and long-term outcome of total shoulder arthroplasty for primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis in middle-aged patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Promising medium-term results from total shoulder arthroplasty   (TSA) have been reported for the treatment of primary osteoarthritis   in young and middle-aged patients. The aim of this study was to   evaluate the long-term functional and radiological outcome of TSA   in the middle-aged patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The data of all patients from the previous medium-term study   were available. At a mean follow-up of 13 years (8 to 17), we reviewed   21 patients (12 men, nine women, 21 shoulders) with a mean age of   55 years (37 to 60). The Constant-Murley score (CS) with its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s   and subjective satisfaction were measured. Radiological signs of implant   loosening were analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Two shoulders (two patients) were revised and in two shoulders   of two different patients, revision surgery was recommended. The   mean CS increased from 23.3 (10 to 45) pre-operatively to 56.5 (26   to 81; p < 0.0001), but with a decrease in CS from 62.8 (38 to   93) to 56.5 (26 to 81) between medium- and long-term follow-up (p   = 0.01). Without revision surgery, 18 patients (95%) rated their   result as good or very good.</p><p>The mean radiolucent line score for the glenoid components increased   from 1.8 (0 to 6) to 8.2 (2 to 18) between medium- and long-term   follow-up (p < 0.001). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TSA in young and middle-aged patients leads to improvement in   clinical function and a relatively high satisfaction rate. However,   clinical or radiological glenoid loosening worsens in the long term.

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteoarthritis   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Our aim was to   investigate the long-term outcome of a consecutive series of patients,   some of whom had anterior knee pain and PFJ OA managed with UKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We assessed the ten-year functional outcomes and 15-year implant   survival of 805 knees (677 patients) following medial mobile-bearing   UKA. The intra-operative status of the PFJ was documented and, with   the exception of bone loss with grooving to the lateral side, neither   the clinical or radiological state of the PFJ nor the presence of   anterior knee pain were considered a contraindication. The impact   of radiographic findings and anterior knee pain was studied in a   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> of 100 knees (91 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no relationship between functional outcomes, at a mean   of ten years, or 15-year implant survival, and pre-operative anterior   knee pain, or the presence or degree of cartilage loss documented   intra-operatively at the medial patella or trochlea, or radiographic   evidence of OA in the medial side of the PFJ. In 6% of cases there   was full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral side of the patella.   In these cases, the overall ten-year function and 15-year survival   was similar to those without cartilage loss; however they had slightly   more difficulty with descending stairs. Radiographic signs of OA   seen in the lateral part of the PFJ were not associated with a definite   compromise in functional outcome or implant survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ with bone loss and   grooving remains a contraindication to mobile-bearing UKA. Less   severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ and damage to the medial   side, however severe, does not compromise the overall function or   survival, so should not be considered to be a contraindication. However,   if a patient does have full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral   side of the PFJ they may have a slight compromise in their ability   to descend stairs. Pre-operative anterior knee pain also does not   compromise the functional outcome or survival and should not be   considered to be a contraindication.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:632–9</p></sec>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal ions in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal ions in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluation)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluation).   Changes in ion levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regression model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal ions   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per billion (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal ions was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relationship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The levels of metal ions in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   metal ions be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.   While those with a MoM THA appear to stabilise at a certain level,   the accuracy of this trend is not yet clear. Vigilant follow-up   is still recommended. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):33–40.</p></sec>

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-thickness cartilage loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-thickness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-operatively. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-operative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively   compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness   cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients   with partial thickness loss achieve a good result we cannot currently   identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful   and misleading.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:475–82.</p></sec>

Staged lengthening and reconstruction for children with a leg-length discrepancy after excision of an osteosarcoma around the knee
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Children treated for osteosarcoma around the knee often have   a substantial leg-length discrepancy at skeletal maturity. The aim   of this study was to investigate the results of staged skeletal   reconstruction after a leg lengthening procedure using an external   fixator in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 11 patients who underwent staged reconstruction with   either an arthroplasty (n = 6) or an arthrodesis (n = 5). A control   group of 11 patients who had undergone wide excision and concurrent   reconstruction with an arthroplasty were matched for gender, location,   and size of tumour. We investigated the change in leg-length discrepancy,   function as assessed by the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Scale   (MSTS) score and complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A mean 5.2 cm (1.7 to 8.9) of lengthening was achieved. The mean   MSTS scores significantly improved after staged reconstruction (p   = 0.003) but were still worse than those of the control group (p   = 0.049). However, the MSTS scores of the arthroplasty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>   were comparable with those of the controls, although the extensor   lag was greater and the range of movement was less. The patient   group experienced more complications, but all of these resolved.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Approximately 5 cm of lengthening and significant functional   improvement can be achieved by staged reconstruction and lengthening,   without major complications. Although it has limitations, this method   of treatment seems to be a satisfactory surgical option for growing   children with a significant leg-length discrepancy after excision   of an osteosarcoma around the knee.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:401–8.</p></sec>

Functional outcomes of conservatively managed acute ruptures of the Achilles tendon
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This prospective cohort study aims to determine if the size of   the tendon gap following acute rupture of the Achilles tendon shows   an association with the functional outcome following non-operative   treatment. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients presenting within two weeks of an acute unilateral   rupture of the Achilles tendon between July 2012 and July 2015 were   considered for the study. In total, 38 patients (nine female, 29   male, mean age 52 years; 29 to 78) completed the study. Dynamic   ultrasound examination was performed to confirm the diagnosis and   measure the gap between ruptured tendon ends. Outcome was assessed   using dynamometric testing of plantarflexion and the Achilles tendon   Total Rupture score (ATRS) six months after the completion of a   rehabilitation programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients with a gap ≥ 10 mm with the ankle in the neutral position   had significantly greater peak torque deficit than those with gaps   < 10 mm (mean 23.3%; 7% to 52% <i>vs </i>14.3%; 0% to   47%, p = 0.023). However, there was no difference   in ATRS between the two groups (mean score 87.2; 74 to 100 <i>vs</i> 87.4;   68 to 97, p = 0.467). There was no significant correlation between   gap size and torque deficit (τ = 0.103), suggesting a non-linear relationship.   There was also no significant correlation between ATRS and peak   torque deficit (τ = -0.305). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>This is the first study to identify an association between tendon   gap and functional outcome in acute rupture of the Achilles tendon.   We have identified 10 mm as a gap size at which deficits in plantarflexion   strength become significantly greater, however, the precise relationship   between gap size and plantarflexion strength remains unclear.

Assessment of resuscitation as measured by markers of metabolic acidosis and features of injury
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The best time for definitive orthopaedic care is often unclear   in patients with multiple injuries. The objective of this study   was make a prospective assessment of the safety of our early appropriate   care (EAC) strategy and to evaluate the potential benefit of additional   laboratory data to determine readiness for surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A cohort of 335 patients with fractures of the pelvis, acetabulum,   femur, or spine were included. Patients underwent definitive fixation   within 36 hours if one of the following three parameters were met:   lactate < 4.0 mmol/L; pH ≥ 7.25; or base excess (BE) ≥ -5.5 mmol/L.   If all three parameters were met, resuscitation was designated full   protocol resuscitation (FPR). If less than all three parameters   were met, it was designated an incomplete protocol resuscitation   (IPR). Complications were assessed by an independent adjudication   committee and included infection; sepsis; PE/DVT; organ failure;   pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, 66 patients (19.7%) developed 90 complications. An   historical cohort of 1441 patients had a complication rate of 22.1%.   The complication rate for patients with only one EAC parameter at   the point of protocol was 34.3%, which was higher than other groups   (p = 0.041). Patients who had IPR did not have significantly more   complications (31.8%) than those who had FPR (22.6%; p = 0.078).

The impact of external fixation on mortality in patients with an unstable pelvic ring fracture
<sec><title>Aim</title><p>There is not adequate evidence to establish whether external   fixation (EF) of pelvic fractures leads to a reduced mortality.   We used the Japan Trauma Data Bank database to identify isolated   unstable pelvic ring fractures to exclude the possibility of blood   loss from other injuries, and analyzed the effectiveness of EF on   mortality in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a registry-based comparison of 1163 patients who had   been treated for an isolated unstable pelvic ring fracture with   (386 patients) or without (777 patients) EF. An isolated pelvic   ring fracture was defined by an Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for   other injuries of < 3. An unstable pelvic ring fracture was defined   as having an AIS ≥ 4. The primary outcome of this study was mortality.   A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analysis was carried out for patients who required blood   transfusion within 24 hours of arrival in the Emergency Department   and those who had massive blood loss (AIS code: 852610.5).

Contribution of Impaired Parasympathetic Activity to Right Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The beneficial effects of parasympathetic stimulation have been reported in left heart failure, but whether it would be beneficial for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains to be explored. Here, we investigated the relationship between parasympathetic activity and right ventricular (RV) function in patients with PAH, and the potential therapeutic effects of pyridostigmine (PYR), an oral drug stimulating the parasympathetic activity through acetylcholinesterase inhibition, in experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Heart rate recovery after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test was used as a surrogate for parasympathetic activity. RV ejection fraction was assessed in 112 patients with PAH. Expression of nicotinic (α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and muscarinic (muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor) receptors, and acetylcholinesterase activity were evaluated in RV (n=11) and lungs (n=7) from patients with PAH undergoing heart/lung transplantation and compared with tissue obtained from controls. In addition, we investigated the effects of PYR (40 mg/kg per day) in experimental PH. PH was induced in male rats by SU5416 (25 mg/kg subcutaneously) injection followed by 4 weeks of hypoxia. In a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>, sympathetic/parasympathetic modulation was assessed by power spectral analysis. At week 6, PH status was confirmed by echocardiography, and rats were randomly assigned to vehicle or treatment (both n=12). At the end of the study, echocardiography was repeated, with additional RV pressure-volume measurements, along with lung, RV histological, and protein analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients with PAH with lower RV ejection fraction (<41%) had a significantly reduced heart rate recovery in comparison with patients with higher RV ejection fraction. In PAH RV samples, α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was increased and acetylcholinesterase activity was reduced versus controls. No difference in muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression was observed. Chronic PYR treatment in PH rats normalized the cardiovascular autonomic function, demonstrated by an increase in parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity. PYR improved survival, increased RV contractility, and reduced RV stiffness, RV hypertrophy, RV fibrosis, RV inflammation, and RV α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression, as well. Furthermore, PYR reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, RV afterload, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was associated with reduced local and systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RV dysfunction is associated with reduced systemic parasympathetic activity in patients with PAH, with an inadequate adaptive response of the cholinergic system in the RV. Enhancing parasympathetic activity by PYR improved survival, RV function, and pulmonary vascular remodeling in experimental PH.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Computed tomography (CT) allows estimation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. We evaluated several progression algorithms in our unselected, population-based cohort for risk prediction of coronary and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 3281 participants (45–74 years of age), free from cardiovascular disease until the second visit, risk factors, and CTs at baseline (b) and after a mean of 5.1 years (5y) were measured. Hard coronary and cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events including revascularization, as well, were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8±2.2 years after the second CT. The added predictive value of 10 CAC progression algorithms on top of risk factors including baseline CAC was evaluated by using survival analysis, C-statistics, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination index. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analysis of risk in CAC categories was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed 85 (2.6%) hard coronary, 161 (4.9%) hard cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for hard/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive value of baseline CT and risk assessment in terms of C-statistic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not improve models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year risk factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and hard/total cardiovascular risk: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively. When CAC<sub>b</sub> progressed from 1 to 399 to CAC<sub>5y</sub>≥400, coronary and total cardiovascular risk were nearly 2-fold in comparison with subjects who remained below CAC<sub>5y</sub>=400. Participants with CAC<sub>b</sub>≥400 had high rates of hard coronary and hard/total cardiovascular events (10-year risk: 12.0%, 13.5%, and 30.9%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CAC progression is associated with coronary and cardiovascular event rates, but adds only weakly to risk prediction. What counts is the most recent CAC value and risk factor assessment. Therefore, a repeat scan >5 years after the first scan may be of additional value, except when a double-zero CT scan is present or when the subjects are already at high risk.</p></sec>

Empagliflozin and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Established Cardiovascular Disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Urinary glucose excretion with empagliflozin decreases with declining renal function, resulting in less potency for glucose lowering in patients with kidney disease. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. We analyzed cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in patients with prevalent kidney disease (defined as eGFR <60 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> and/or urine albumin-creatinine ratio >300 mg/g) at baseline. Additional analyses were performed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s by baseline eGFR (<45, 45–<60, 60–<90, ≥90 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>) and baseline urine albumin-creatinine ratio (>300, 30–≤300, <30 mg/g).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 7020 patients treated, 2250 patients had prevalent kidney disease at baseline, of whom 67% had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for >10 years, 58% were receiving insulin, and 84% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 29% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–0.98), the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99), the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 39% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.87), and the risk of all-cause hospitalization by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.92). Effects of empagliflozin on these outcomes were consistent across categories of eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio at baseline and across the 2 doses studied. The adverse event profile of empagliflozin in patients with eGFR <60 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> was consistent with the overall trial population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Empagliflozin improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality in vulnerable patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Mortality and Cerebrovascular Events After Heart Rhythm Disorder Management Procedures
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of rates and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of death and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder management (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in electrophysiology laboratories. Our primary aim was to assess and characterize death and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital deaths and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of death and CVE rates was performed for ablation, device implantation, electrophysiology study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE rates in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively. Patients undergoing lead extraction had the highest overall mortality rate at 1.9% (95% CI, 1.34–2.61) and CVE rate at 0.62% (95% CI, 0.32–1.07). Among patients undergoing HRDM procedures, 48% of deaths directly related to the HDRM procedure were among patients undergoing device implantation procedures. Overall, cardiac tamponade was the most frequent direct cause of death (40%), and infection was the most common indirect cause of death (29%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0.76%, with the highest being in lead extraction procedures (3.08%), followed by device implantation procedures (0.94%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Half of the deaths directly related to an HRDM procedure were among the patients undergoing device implantation procedures, with cardiac tamponade being the most common cause of death. This highlights the importance of the development of protocols for the quick identification and management of cardiac tamponade even in procedures typically believed to be lower risk such as device implantation.</p></sec>

Time to Epinephrine Administration and Survival From Nonshockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Among Children and Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that earlier epinephrine administration is associated with improved survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable initial rhythms. However, the effect of epinephrine timing on patients with nonshockable initial rhythms is unclear. The objective of this study was to measure the association between time to epinephrine administration and survival in adults and children with emergency medical services (EMS)–treated OHCA with nonshockable initial rhythms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of OHCAs prospectively identified by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium network from June 4, 2011, to June 30, 2015. We included patients of all ages with an EMS-treated OHCA and an initial nonshockable rhythm. We excluded those with return of spontaneous circulation in <10 minutes. We conducted a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analysis involving patients <18 years of age. The primary exposure was time (minutes) from arrival of the first EMS agency to the first dose of epinephrine. Secondary exposure was time to epinephrine dichotomized as early (<10 minutes) or late (≥10 minutes). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. We adjusted for Utstein covariates and Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium study site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 55 568 EMS-treated OHCAs, 32 101 patients with initial nonshockable rhythms were included. There were 12 238 in the early group, 14 517 in the late group, and 5346 not treated with epinephrine. After adjusting for potential confounders, each minute from EMS arrival to epinephrine administration was associated with a 4% decrease in odds of survival for adults, odds ratio=0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.98). A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analysis (n=13 290) examining neurological outcomes showed a similar association (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94 per minute; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.98). When epinephrine was given late in comparison with early, odds of survival were 18% lower (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.98). In a pediatric analysis (n=595), odds of survival were 9% lower (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.01) for each minute delay in epinephrine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among OHCAs with nonshockable initial rhythms, the majority of patients were administered epinephrine >10 minutes after EMS arrival. Each minute delay in epinephrine administration was associated with decreased survival and unfavorable neurological outcomes. EMS agencies should consider strategies to reduce epinephrine administration times in patients with initial nonshockable rhythms.</p></sec>

High-Dose Versus Low-Dose Pitavastatin in Japanese Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease (REAL-CAD)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current guidelines call for high-intensity statin therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease on the basis of several previous “more versus less statins” trials. However, no clear evidence for more versus less statins has been established in an Asian population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded end point study, 13 054 Japanese patients with stable coronary artery disease who achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <120 mg/dL during a run-in period (pitavastatin 1 mg/d) were randomized in a 1-to-1 fashion to high-dose (pitavastatin 4 mg/d; n=6526) or low-dose (pitavastatin 1 mg/d; n=6528) statin therapy. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring emergency hospitalization. The secondary composite end point was a composite of the primary end point and clinically indicated coronary revascularization excluding target-lesion revascularization at sites of prior percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the study population was 68 years, and 83% were male. The mean LDL-C level before enrollment was 93 mg/dL with 91% of patients taking statins. The baseline LDL-C level after the run-in period on pitavastatin 1 mg/d was 87.7 and 88.1 mg/dL in the high-dose and low-dose groups, respectively. During the entire course of follow-up, LDL-C in the high-dose group was lower by 14.7 mg/dL than in the low-dose group (<i>P</i><0.001). With a median follow-up of 3.9 years, high-dose as compared with low-dose pitavastatin significantly reduced the risk of the primary end point (266 patients [4.3%] and 334 patients [5.4%]; hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.95; <i>P</i>=0.01) and the risk of the secondary composite end point (489 patients [7.9%] and 600 patients [9.7%]; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.73–0.93; <i>P</i>=0.002). High-dose pitavastatin also significantly reduced the risks of several other secondary end points such as all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and clinically indicated coronary revascularization. The results for the primary and the secondary composite end points were consistent across several prespecified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s, including the low (<95 mg/dL) baseline LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>. Serious adverse event rates were low in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>High-dose (4 mg/d) compared with low-dose (1 mg/d) pitavastatin therapy significantly reduced cardiovascular events in Japanese patients with stable coronary artery disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Second Arterial Versus Venous Conduits for Multivessel Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery in California
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Whether a second arterial conduit improves outcomes after multivessel coronary artery bypass grafting remains unclear. Consequently, arterial conduits other than the left internal thoracic artery are seldom used in the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using a state-maintained clinical registry including all 126 nonfederal hospitals in California, we compared all-cause mortality and rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and sternal wound infection between propensity score–matched cohorts who underwent primary, isolated multivessel coronary artery bypass grafting with the left internal thoracic artery, and who received a second arterial conduit (right internal thoracic artery or radial artery, n=5866) or a venous conduit (n=53 566) between 2006 and 2011. Propensity score matching using 34 preoperative characteristics yielded 5813 matched sets. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analysis compared outcomes between propensity score–matched recipients of a right internal thoracic artery (n=1576) or a radial artery (n=4290).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Second arterial conduit use decreased from 10.7% in 2006 to 9.1% in 2011 (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, receipt of a second arterial conduit was associated with significantly lower mortality (13.1% versus 10.6% at 7 years; hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72–0.87), and lower risks of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70–0.87) and repeat revascularization (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76–0.88). In comparison with radial artery grafts, right internal thoracic artery grafts were associated with similar mortality rates (right internal thoracic artery 10.3% versus radial artery 10.7% at 7 years; hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.89–1.37) and individual risks of cardiovascular events, but the risk of sternal wound infection was increased (risk difference, 1.07%; 95% CI, 0.15–2.07).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Second arterial conduit use in California is low and declining, but arterial grafts were associated with significantly lower mortality and fewer cardiovascular events. A right internal thoracic artery graft offered no benefit over that of a radial artery, but did increase risk of sternal wound infection. These findings suggest surgeons should consider lowering their threshold for using arterial grafts, and the radial artery may be the preferred second conduit.</p></sec>

Benefit of Adding Ezetimibe to Statin Therapy on Cardiovascular Outcomes and Safety in Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ezetimibe, when added to simvastatin, reduces cardiovascular events after acute coronary syndrome. We explored outcomes stratified by diabetes mellitus (DM).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), 18 144 patients after acute coronary syndrome with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 50 to 125 mg/dL were randomized to 40 mg ezetimibe/simvastatin (E/S) or 40 mg placebo/simvastatin. The primary composite end point was cardiovascular death, major coronary events, and stroke. DM was a prespecified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 4933 (27%) patients with DM were more often older and female, had had a prior myocardial infarction and revascularization, and presented more frequently with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome compared with patients without DM (each <i>P</i><0.001). The median admission low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower among patients with DM (89 versus 97 mg/dL, <i>P</i><0.001). E/S achieved a significantly lower median time-weighted average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with placebo/simvastatin, irrespective of DM (DM: 49 versus 67 mg/dL; no DM: 55 versus 71 mg/dL; both <i>P</i><0.001). In patients with DM, E/S reduced the 7-year Kaplan–Meier primary end point event rate by 5.5% absolute (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.94); in patients without DM, the absolute difference was 0.7% (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.04; <i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.02). The largest relative reductions in patients with DM were in myocardial infarction (24%) and ischemic stroke (39%). No differences in safety outcomes by treatment were present regardless of DM. When stratified further by age, patients ≥75 years of age had a 20% relative reduction in the primary end point regardless of DM (<i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.91), whereas patients <75 years of age with DM had greater benefit than those without (<i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.011). When stratified by the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Risk Score for Secondary Prevention, all patients with DM demonstrated benefit with E/S regardless of risk. In contrast, among patients without DM, those with a high risk score experienced a significant (18%) relative reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke with E/S compared with placebo/simvastatin, whereas patients without DM at low or moderate risk demonstrated no benefit with the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin (<i>P</i><sub>int</sub> =0.034).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In IMPROVE-IT, the benefit of adding ezetimibe to statin was enhanced in patients with DM and in high-risk patients without DM.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely based on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of diagnosis of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (hazard ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard ratio death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-intensity statins with lower amputation and death risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-intensity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-based study to show that high-intensity statin use at the time of PAD diagnosis is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and mortality in comparison with low-to-moderate–intensity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as well.</p></sec>

Efficacy and Safety of the Use of Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Concomitant Aspirin Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current guidelines recommend non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) as the first-choice therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation because these drugs have several benefits over the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). It is unknown whether these benefits remain when NOACs have to be combined with aspirin therapy. To assess the efficacy and safety of NOACs compared with VKAs in patients with atrial fibrillation and concomitant aspirin therapy, we conducted a systematic review and study–based meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic electronic literature search was done in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials for studies including published data of patients ≥18 years of age with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, randomized to either VKAs or NOACs, or receiving aspirin therapy at any time during the study that report all-cause stroke or systemic embolism, vascular death, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, or intracranial hemorrhage as an outcome. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome were extracted from the individual studies and pooled with random-effects meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>This study-based meta-analysis was restricted to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s of patients on aspirin therapy (n=21 722) from 4 randomized controlled trials comparing VKAs and NOACs (n=71 681) in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. In this meta-analysis including patients on mainly low-dose aspirin, NOACs were found to be more effective (outcome of stroke or systemic embolism: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67–0.91; vascular death: HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.93) and as safe as VKAs with respect to major bleeding (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69–1.01).

Survival and Left Ventricular Function Changes in Fulminant Versus Nonfulminant Acute Myocarditis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous reports have suggested that despite their dramatic presentation, patients with fulminant myocarditis (FM) might have better outcome than those with acute nonfulminant myocarditis (NFM). In this retrospective study, we report outcome and changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in a large cohort of patients with FM compared with patients with NFM.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population consists of 187 consecutive patients admitted between May 2001 and November 2016 with a diagnosis of acute myocarditis (onset of symptoms <1 month) of whom 55 required inotropes and/or mechanical circulatory support (FM) and the remaining 132 were hemodynamically stable (NFM). We also performed a subanalysis in 130 adult patients with acute viral myocarditis and viral prodrome within 2 weeks from the onset, which includes 34 with FM and 96 with NFM. Patients with giant-cell myocarditis, eosinophilic myocarditis, or cardiac sarcoidosis and those <15 years of age were excluded from the subanalysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the whole population (n=187), the rate of in-hospital death or heart transplantation was 25.5% versus 0% in FM versus NFM, respectively (<i>P</i><0.0001). Long-term heart transplantation–free survival at 9 years was lower in FM than NFM (64.5% versus 100%, log-rank <i>P</i><0.0001). Despite greater improvement in LVEF during hospitalization in FM versus NFM forms (median, 32% [interquartile range, 20%–40%] versus 3% [0%–10%], respectively; <i>P</i><0.0001), the proportion of patients with LVEF <55% at last follow-up was higher in FM versus NFM (29% versus 9%; relative risk, 3.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.45–7.64, <i>P</i>=0.003). Similar results for survival and changes in LVEF in FM versus NFM were observed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> (n=130) with viral myocarditis. None of the patients with NFM and LVEF ≥55% at discharge had a significant decrease in LVEF at follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Patients with FM have an increased mortality and need for heart transplantation compared with those with NFM. From a functional viewpoint, patients with FM have a more severely impaired LVEF at admission that, despite steep improvement during hospitalization, remains lower than that in patients with NFM at long-term follow-up. These findings also hold true when only the viral forms are considered and are different from previous studies showing better prognosis in FM.</p></sec>

There was a nonsignificant reduction in the first event of stroke of any etiology (4.2% versus 4.8%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.052) with ezetimibe/simvastatin versus placebo/simvastatin, driven by a significant 21% reduction in ischemic stroke (3.4% versus 4.1%; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.008) and a nonsignificant increase in hemorrhagic stroke (0.8% versus 0.6%; HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.93–2.04; <i>P</i>=0.11). Evaluating total events, including the first and all recurrent strokes, ezetimibe/simvastatin reduced stroke of any etiology (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.029) and ischemic stroke (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.003).

Low-Dose Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The long-term efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are still inconclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The JPAD trial (Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis With Aspirin for Diabetes) was a randomized, open-label, standard care–controlled trial examining whether low-dose aspirin affected cardiovascular events in 2539 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without preexisting cardiovascular disease. Patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily; aspirin group) or no aspirin (no-aspirin group) in the JPAD trial. After that trial ended in 2008, we followed up with the patients until 2015, with no attempt to change the previously assigned therapy. Primary end points were cardiovascular events, including sudden death, fatal or nonfatal coronary artery disease, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. For the safety analysis, hemorrhagic events, consisting of gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, and bleeding from any other sites, were also analyzed. The primary analysis was conducted for cardiovascular events among patients who retained their original allocation (a per-protocol cohort). Analyses on an intention-to-treat cohort were conducted for hemorrhagic events and statistical sensitivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median follow-up period was 10.3 years; 1621 patients (64%) were followed up throughout the study; and 2160 patients (85%) retained their original allocation. Low-dose aspirin did not reduce cardiovascular events in the per-protocol cohort (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.42). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, sex, glycemic control, kidney function, smoking status, hypertension, and dyslipidemia showed similar results (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.30), with no heterogeneity of efficacy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analyses stratified by each of these factors (all interaction <i>P</i>>0.05). Sensitivity analyses on the intention-to-treat cohort yielded consistent results (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.25). Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 25 patients (2%) in the aspirin group and 12 (0.9%) in the no-aspirin group (<i>P</i>=0.03), and the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was not different between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Low-dose aspirin did not affect the risk for cardiovascular events but increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a primary prevention setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Coronary Artery Calcium to Guide a Personalized Risk-Based Approach to Initiation and Intensification of Antihypertensive Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The use of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk to personalize systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment goals is a topic of increasing interest. Therefore, we studied whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) can further guide the allocation of anti-hypertensive treatment intensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included 3733 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with SBP between 120 and 179 mm Hg. Within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s categorized by both SBP (120–139 mm Hg, 140–159 mm Hg, and 160–179 mm Hg) and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk (using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Assocation pooled-cohort equations), we compared multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for the composite outcome of incident ASCVD or heart failure after further stratifying by CAC (0, 1–100, or >100). We estimated 10-year number-needed-to-treat for an intensive SBP goal of 120 mm Hg by applying the treatment benefit recorded in meta-analyses to event rates within CAC strata.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 65 years, and 642 composite events took place over a median of 10.2 years. In persons with SBP <160 mm Hg, CAC stratified risk for events. For example, among those with an ASCVD risk of <15% and who had an SBP of either 120 to 139 mm Hg or 140 to 159 mm Hg, respectively, we found increasing hazard ratios for events with CAC 1 to 100 (1.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.0–2.6] or 2.0 [1.1–3.8]) and CAC >100 (3.0 [1.8–5.0] or 5.7 [2.9–11.0]), all relative to CAC=0. There appeared to be no statistical association between CAC and events when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg, irrespective of ASCVD risk level. Estimated 10-year number-needed-to-treat for a SBP goal of 120mmHg varied substantially according to CAC levels when predicted ASCVD risk <15% and SBP <160mmHg (eg, 10-year number-needed-to-treat of 99 for CAC=0 and 24 for CAC>100, when SBP 120-139mm Hg). However, few participants with ASCVD risk <5% had elevated CAC. Furthermore, 10-year number-needed-to-treat estimates were consistently low and varied less among CAC strata when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg or when ASCVD risk was ≥15% at any SBP level.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Combined CAC imaging and assessment of global ASCVD risk has the potential to guide personalized SBP goals (eg, choosing a traditional goal of 140 or a more intensive goal of 120 mm Hg), particularly among adults with an estimated ASCVD risk of 5% to 15% and prehypertension or mild hypertension.</p></sec>

Effect of Aggressive Blood Pressure Control on the Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation After Catheter Ablation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation has become an important therapy for AF; however, recurrence rates remain high. We proposed to determine whether aggressive blood pressure (BP) lowering prevents recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) after catheter ablation in patients with AF and a high symptom burden.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We randomly assigned 184 patients with AF and a BP >130/80 mm Hg to aggressive BP (target <120/80 mm Hg) or standard BP (target <140/90 mm Hg) treatment before their scheduled AF catheter ablation. The primary outcome was symptomatic recurrence of AF/atrial tachycardia/atrial flutter lasting >30 seconds, determined 3 months beyond catheter ablation by a blinded end-point evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median follow-up was 14 months. At 6 months, the mean systolic BP was 123.2±13.2 mm Hg in the aggressive BP treatment group versus 135.4±15.7 mm Hg (<i>P</i><0.001) in the standard treatment group. The primary outcome occurred in 106 patients, 54 (61.4%) in the aggressive BP treatment group compared with 52 (61.2%) in the standard treatment group (hazard ratio=0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.65–1.38; <i>P</i>=0.763). In the prespecified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analysis of the influence of age, patients ≥61 years of age had a lower primary outcome event rate with aggressive BP (hazard ratio=0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.34–0.97; <i>P</i>=0.013). There was a higher rate of hypotension requiring medication adjustment in the aggressive BP group (26% versus 0%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this study, this duration of aggressive BP treatment did not reduce atrial arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation for AF but resulted in more hypotension.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular system (t-system) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-system in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-system structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-system. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-system remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-system components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-system density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-system density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-system density versus cells with high t-system density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-system in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-system impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-system at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after mechanical unloading.</p></sec>

Association Between Duration of Resuscitation and Favorable Outcome After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little evidence guides the appropriate duration of resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and case features justifying longer or shorter durations are ill defined. We estimated the impact of resuscitation duration on the probability of favorable functional outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using a large, multicenter cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a secondary analysis of a North American, single-blind, multicenter, cluster-randomized, clinical trial (ROC-PRIMED [Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Prehospital Resuscitation Using an Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed]) of consecutive adults with nontraumatic, emergency medical services–treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Primary exposure was duration of resuscitation in minutes (onset of professional resuscitation to return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC] or termination of resuscitation). Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] score of 0–3). Subjects were additionally classified as survival with unfavorable outcome (mRS score of 4–5), ROSC without survival (mRS score of 6), or without ROSC. Subject accrual was plotted as a function of resuscitation duration, and the dynamic probability of favorable outcome at discharge was estimated for the whole cohort and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s. Adjusted logistic regression models tested the association between resuscitation duration and survival with favorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The primary cohort included 11 368 subjects (median age, 69 years [interquartile range, 56–81 years]; 7121 men [62.6%]). Of these, 4023 (35.4%) achieved ROSC, 1232 (10.8%) survived to hospital discharge, and 905 (8.0%) had an mRS score of 0 to 3 at discharge. Distribution of cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration differed by outcome (<i>P</i><0.00001). For cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration up to 37.0 minutes (95% confidence interval, 34.9–40.9 minutes), 99% with an eventual mRS score of 0 to 3 at discharge achieved ROSC. The dynamic probability of an mRS score of 0 to 3 at discharge declined over elapsed resuscitation duration, but subjects with initial shockable cardiac rhythm, witnessed cardiac arrest, and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation were more likely to survive with favorable outcome after prolonged efforts (30–40 minutes). After adjustment for prehospital (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.92–0.95) and inpatient (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.99) covariates, resuscitation duration was associated with survival to discharge with an mRS score of 0 to 3.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Shorter resuscitation duration was associated with likelihood of favorable outcome at hospital discharge. Subjects with favorable case features were more likely to survive prolonged resuscitation up to 47 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Data are limited on the implementation of evidence-based multilevel interventions targeted at blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive blacks who receive care in low-resource primary care practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension is a cluster-randomized clinical trial in which 30 community health centers were randomly assigned to the intervention condition (IC) or usual care (UC). Patients at the IC sites received patient education, home BP monitoring, and monthly lifestyle counseling, whereas physicians attended monthly hypertension case rounds and received feedback on their patients’ home BP readings and chart audits. Patients and physicians at the UC sites received printed patient education material and hypertension treatment guidelines, respectively. The primary outcome was BP control, and secondary outcomes were mean changes in systolic and diastolic BPs at 12 months, assessed with an automated BP device. A total of 1059 patients (mean age, 56 years; 28% men, 59% obese, and 36% with diabetes mellitus) were enrolled. The BP control rate was similar in both groups (IC=49.3% versus UC=44.5%; odds ratio, 1.21 [95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.63]; <i>P</i>=0.21). In prespecified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analyses, the intervention was associated with greater BP control in patients without diabetes mellitus (IC=54.0% versus UC=44.7%; odds ratio, 1.45 [confidence interval, 1.02–2.06]); and small-sized community health centers (IC=51.1% versus UC=39.6%; odds ratio, 1.45 [confidence interval, 1.04–2.45]).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>A practice-based, multicomponent intervention was no better than UC in improving BP control among hypertensive blacks.

Repeat Coronary Revascularization After Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>A major advantage of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) relative to percutaneous coronary intervention is its durability, yet there is a paucity of information on rates and predictors of repeat coronary revascularization after CABG in the modern era.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We included patients ≥65 years from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons’ National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database who were undergoing first-time isolated CABG from 1991 to 2007 (n=723 134, median age 73 years). After linking to Medicare claims data, long-term outcomes of CABG (up to 18 years after surgery) were examined by use of cumulative incidence curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to identify factors associated with 1- and 5-year repeat revascularization trends and variability. We found that the overall 18-year survival rate was 20%. Cumulative incidences of any repeat revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG, yet most often percutaneous coronary intervention) were 2%, 7%, 13%, and 16% at 1, 5, 10, and 18 years after surgery, respectively. The rates of repeat CABG procedures were quite low for all time points (0.1%, 0.6%, 1.3%, and 1.7%, respectively). Female sex, disease severity represented by a history of percutaneous coronary intervention, preoperative dialysis, and partial revascularization were strongly associated with a higher revascularization rate, whereas advanced age, left main disease, and smoking were associated with a lower rate. There was approximately a 2-fold variation in repeat revascularization rates across centers at 1 year (interquartile range 1.7–3.6%) and 5 years (interquartile range 6.7–12.0%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Repeat revascularization is performed infrequently among older patients who undergo CABG; however, these rates vary substantially by patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s and among providers.</p></sec>

Long-Term Safety and Effectiveness of Mechanical Versus Biologic Aortic Valve Prostheses in Older Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>There is a paucity of long-term data comparing biological versus mechanical aortic valve prostheses in older individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed follow-up of patients aged 65 to 80 years undergoing aortic valve replacement with a biological (n=24 410) or mechanical (n=14 789) prosthesis from 1991 to 1999 at 605 centers within the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database using Medicare inpatient claims (mean, 12.6 years; maximum, 17 years; minimum, 8 years), and outcomes were compared by propensity methods. Among Medicare-linked patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (mean age, 73 years), both reoperation (4.0%) and endocarditis (1.9%) were uncommon to 12 years; however, the risk for other adverse outcomes was high, including death (66.5%), stroke (14.1%), and bleeding (17.9%). Compared with those receiving a mechanical valve, patients given a bioprosthesis had a similar adjusted risk for death (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.07), higher risks for reoperation (hazard ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 2.14–3.03) and endocarditis (hazard ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–1.94), and lower risks for stroke (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.93) and bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.70).

Late Outcomes of Mitral Valve Repair for Mitral Regurgitation Due to Degenerative Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The pathological spectrum of degenerative diseases of the mitral valve (MV) that causes mitral regurgitation (MR) is broad, and there is limited information on late outcomes of MV repair in various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s of patients and pathologies. This study examines this issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>All 840 patients who had MV repair for MR due to degenerative diseases from 1985 to 2004 were prospectively followed with clinical and echocardiographic evaluations at biennial intervals up to 26 years, median of 10.4 years. Clinical, hemodynamic, and pathological variables were evaluated for their association with outcomes. Age, left ventricular ejection fraction, and functional class were predictors of late cardiac- and valve-related deaths by multivariable analysis. MV repair failed to restore life span to normal in patients with functional class IV. Thirty-eight patients had repeat MV surgery, and the probability of reoperation at 20 years was 5.9%. During the follow-up, recurrent severe MR developed in 37 patients, and moderate MR developed in 61. Age, isolated prolapse of the anterior leaflet, the degree of myxomatous changes in the MV, lack of mitral annuloplasty, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass were associated with increased risk of recurrent MR. At 20 years, the freedom from recurrent severe MR was 90.7%, and the freedom from moderate or severe MR was 69.2%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>MV repair for degenerative MR restored life span to normal except in patients with symptoms at rest and impaired left ventricular function. Advanced age and complex mitral valve pathologies increased the risk of late recurrent MR.</p></sec>

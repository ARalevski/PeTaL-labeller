Elevated <i>HLA-A</i> expression impairs HIV control through inhibition of NKG2A-expressing cells
<p>The highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (<i>HLA</i>) locus encodes cell surface proteins that are critical for immunity. <i>HLA-A</i> expression levels vary in an allele-dependent manner, diversifying allele-specific effects beyond peptide-binding preference. Analysis of 9763 HIV-infected individuals from 21 cohorts shows that higher <i>HLA-A</i> levels confer poorer control of HIV. Elevated <i>HLA-A</i> expression provides enhanced levels of an HLA-A–derived signal peptide that specifically binds and determines expression levels of HLA-E, the ligand for the inhibitory NKG2A natural killer (NK) cell receptor. <i>HLA-B</i> haplotypes that favor NKG2A-mediated NK cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">licens</span></strong>ing (i.e., education) exacerbate the deleterious effect of high <i>HLA-A</i> on HIV control, consistent with NKG2A-mediated inhibition impairing NK cell clearance of HIV-infected targets. Therapeutic blockade of HLA-E:NKG2A interaction may yield benefit in HIV disease.</p>

Synthetic transcription elongation factors license transcription across repressive chromatin
<p>The release of paused RNA polymerase II into productive elongation is highly regulated, especially at genes that affect human development and disease. To exert control over this rate-limiting step, we designed sequence-specific synthetic transcription elongation factors (Syn-TEFs). These molecules are composed of programmable DNA-binding ligands flexibly tethered to a small molecule that engages the transcription elongation machinery. By limiting activity to targeted loci, Syn-TEFs convert constituent modules from broad-spectrum inhibitors of transcription into gene-specific stimulators. Here we present Syn-TEF1, a molecule that actively enables transcription across repressive GAA repeats that silence frataxin expression in Friedreich’s ataxia, a terminal neurodegenerative disease with no effective therapy. The modular design of Syn-TEF1 defines a general framework for developing a class of molecules that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">licens</span></strong>e transcription elongation at targeted genomic loci.</p>

TreeScaper: Visualizing and Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Sets of Trees
<p>Modern phylogenomic analyses often result in large collections of phylogenetic trees representing uncertainty in individual gene trees, variation across genes, or both. Extracting phylogenetic signal from these tree sets can be challenging, as they are difficult to visualize, explore, and quantify. To overcome some of these challenges, we have developed TreeScaper, an application for tree set visualization as well as the identification of distinct phylogenetic signals. GUI and command-line versions of TreeScaper and a manual with tutorials can be downloaded from <ext-link>https://github.com/whuang08/TreeScaper/releases</ext-link>.

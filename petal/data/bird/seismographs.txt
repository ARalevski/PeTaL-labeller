A surface gravity traverse on Mars indicates low bedrock density at Gale crater
<p>Gravimetry, the precise measurement of gravitational fields, can be used to probe the internal structure of Earth and other planets. The Curiosity rover on Mars carries <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acceleromet</span></strong>ers normally used for navigation and attitude determination. We have recalibrated them to isolate the signature of the changing gravitational acceleration as the rover climbs through Gale crater. The subsurface rock density is inferred from the measured decrease in gravitational field strength with elevation. The density of the sedimentary rocks in Gale crater is 1680 ± 180 kilograms per cubic meter. This value is lower than expected, indicating a high porosity and constraining maximum burial depths of the rocks over their history.</p>

Ultrastable laser interferometry for earthquake detection with terrestrial and submarine cables
<p>Detecting ocean-floor seismic activity is crucial for our understanding of the interior structure and dynamic behavior of Earth. However, 70% of the planet’s surface is covered by water, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seismomet</span></strong>er coverage is limited to a handful of permanent ocean bottom stations. We show that existing telecommunication optical fiber cables can detect seismic events when combined with state-of-the-art frequency metrology techniques by using the fiber itself as the sensing element. We detected earthquakes over terrestrial and submarine links with lengths ranging from 75 to 535 kilometers and a geographical distance from the earthquake’s epicenter ranging from 25 to 18,500 kilometers. Implementing a global seismic network for real-time detection of underwater earthquakes requires applying the proposed technique to the existing extensive submarine optical fiber network.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acceleromet</span></strong>ers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency stability of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased damping leads to better stability and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator stability.</p>

From local collective behavior to global migratory patterns in white storks
<p>Soaring migrant birds exploit columns of rising air (thermals) to cover large distances with minimal energy. Using social information while locating thermals may benefit such birds, but examining collective movements in wild migrants has been a major challenge for researchers. We investigated the group movements of a flock of 27 naturally migrating juvenile white storks by using high-resolution GPS and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acceleromet</span></strong>ers. Analyzing individual and group movements on multiple scales revealed that a small number of leaders navigated to and explored thermals, whereas followers benefited from their movements. Despite this benefit, followers often left thermals earlier and at lower height, and consequently they had to flap considerably more. Followers also migrated less far annually than did leaders. We provide insights into the interactions between freely flying social migrants and the costs and benefits of collective movement in natural populations.</p>

Determination of intrinsic attenuation in the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system
<p>We recorded <i>P</i> and <i>S</i> waves traveling through the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system (LAS) using broadband ocean-bottom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seismomet</span></strong>ers in the northwest Pacific, and we quantitatively separated the intrinsic (anelastic) and extrinsic (scattering) attenuation effects on seismic wave propagation to directly infer the thermomechanical properties of the oceanic LAS. The strong intrinsic attenuation in the asthenosphere obtained at higher frequency (~3 hertz) is comparable to that constrained at lower frequency (~100 seconds) by surface waves and suggests frequency-independent anelasticity, whereas the intrinsic attenuation in the lithosphere is frequency dependent. This difference in frequency dependence indicates that the strong and broad peak dissipation recently observed in the laboratory exists only in the asthenosphere and provides new insight into what distinguishes the asthenosphere from the lithosphere.</p>

Paradoxical escape responses by narwhals (<i>Monodon monoceros</i>)
<p>Until recent declines in Arctic sea ice levels, narwhals (<i>Monodon monoceros</i>) have lived in relative isolation from human perturbation and sustained predation pressures. The resulting naivety has made this cryptic, deep-diving cetacean highly susceptible to disturbance, although quantifiable effects have been lacking. We deployed a submersible, animal-borne electrocardiograph-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acceleromet</span></strong>er-depth recorder to monitor physiological and behavioral responses of East Greenland narwhals after release from net entanglement and stranding. Escaping narwhals displayed a paradoxical cardiovascular down-regulation (extreme bradycardia with heart rate ≤4 beats per minute) superimposed on exercise up-regulation (stroke frequency >25 strokes per minute and energetic costs three to six times the resting rate of energy expenditure) that rapidly depleted onboard oxygen stores. We attribute this unusual reaction to opposing cardiovascular signals—from diving, exercise, and neurocognitive fear responses—that challenge physiological homeostasis.</p>

Observations and modeling of the elastogravity signals preceding direct seismic waves
<p>After an earthquake, the earliest deformation signals are not expected to be carried by the fastest (<i>P</i>) elastic waves but by the speed-of-light changes of the gravitational field. However, these perturbations are weak and, so far, their detection has not been accurate enough to fully understand their origins and to use them for a highly valuable rapid estimate of the earthquake magnitude. We show that gravity perturbations are particularly well observed with broadband <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seismomet</span></strong>ers at distances between 1000 and 2000 kilometers from the source of the 2011, moment magnitude 9.1, Tohoku earthquake. We can accurately model them by a new formalism, taking into account both the gravity changes and the gravity-induced motion. These prompt elastogravity signals open the window for minute time-scale magnitude determination for great earthquakes.</p>

Prolonged, Uninterrupted Sedentary Behavior and Glycemic Biomarkers Among US Hispanic/Latino Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Excessive sedentary time is ubiquitous in developed nations and is associated with deleterious health outcomes. Few studies have examined whether the manner in which sedentary time is accrued (in short or long bouts) carries any clinical relevance. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of prolonged, uninterrupted sedentary behavior with glycemic biomarkers in a cohort of US Hispanic/Latino adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 12 083 participants from the HCHS/SOL (Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos), a population-based study of Hispanic/Latino adults 18 to 74 years of age. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and glycosylated hemoglobin were measured from a fasting blood sample, and 2-hour glucose was measured after an oral glucose tolerance test. Sedentary time was objectively measured with a hip-mounted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acceleromet</span></strong>er. Prolonged, uninterrupted sedentariness was expressed as mean sedentary bout length.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After adjustment for potential confounders and moderate to vigorous physical activity, longer sedentary bout duration was dose-dependently associated with increased homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (<i>P</i> for trend<0.001) and 2-hour glucose levels (<i>P</i> for trend=0.015). These associations were not independent of total sedentary time; however, a significant interaction between sedentary bout duration and total sedentary time was observed. Evaluation of the joint association of total sedentary time and sedentary bout duration showed that participants in the upper quartile for both sedentary characteristics (ie, high total sedentary time and high sedentary bout duration) had the highest levels of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (<i>P</i><0.001 versus low group for both sedentary characteristics) and 2-hour glucose (<i>P</i>=0.002 versus low group for both sedentary characteristics). High total sedentary time or high sedentary bout duration alone were not associated with differences in any glycemic biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Accruing sedentary time in prolonged, uninterrupted bouts may be deleteriously associated with biomarkers of glucose regulation.</p></sec>

Drag, but not buoyancy, affects swim speed in captive Steller sea lions
<p>Swimming at an optimal speed is critical for breath-hold divers seeking to maximize the time they can spend foraging underwater. Theoretical studies have predicted that the optimal swim speed for an animal while transiting to and from depth is independent of buoyancy, but is dependent on drag and metabolic rate. However, this prediction has never been experimentally tested. Our study assessed the effects of buoyancy and drag on the swim speed of three captive Steller sea lions (<i>Eumetopias jubatus</i>) that made 186 dives. Our study animals were trained to dive to feed at fixed depths (10–50 m) under artificially controlled buoyancy and drag conditions. Buoyancy and drag were manipulated using a pair of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes attached to harnesses worn by the sea lions, and buoyancy conditions were designed to fall within the natural range of wild animals (∼12–26% subcutaneous fat). Drag conditions were changed with and without the PVC tubes, and swim speeds were recorded and compared during descent and ascent phases using an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acceleromet</span></strong>er attached to the harnesses. Generalized linear mixed-effect models with the animal as the random variable and five explanatory variables (body mass, buoyancy, dive depth, dive phase, and drag) showed that swim speed was best predicted by two variables, drag and dive phase (AIC = −139). Consistent with a previous theoretical prediction, the results of our study suggest that the optimal swim speed of Steller sea lions is a function of drag, and is independent of dive depth and buoyancy.</p>

Large-amplitude transfer motion of hydrated excess protons mapped by ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy
<p>Solvation and transport of excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s in aqueous systems play a fundamental role in acid-base chemistry and biochemical processes. We mapped ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> excursions along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfer coordinate by means of two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, both in bulk water and in a Zundel cation (H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup> motif selectively prepared in acetonitrile. Electric fields from the environment and stochastic hydrogen bond motions induce fluctuations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> double-minimum potential. Within the lifetime of a particular hydration geometry, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> explores a multitude of positions on a sub-100-femtosecond time scale. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfer vibration is strongly damped by its 20- to 40-femtosecond population decay. Our results suggest a central role of Zundel-like geometries in aqueous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> solvation and transport.</p>

Measurement of the neutron lifetime using a magneto-gravitational trap and in situ detection
<p>The precise value of the mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> lifetime, τ<sub>n</sub>, plays an important role in nuclear and particle physics and cosmology. It is used to predict the ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s to helium atoms in the primordial universe and to search for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. We eliminated loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by levitating polarized ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong>s above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong>s do not interact with material trap walls. As a result of this approach and the use of an in situ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> detector, the lifetime reported here [877.7 ± 0.7 (stat) +0.4/–0.2 (sys) seconds] does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.</p>

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p>Ion channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified ion channels selective for other monatomic ions, only one type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective ion channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective ion channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels. Evolutionary conservation of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribution suggest a broad role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings
<p>Saturn has a sufficiently strong dipole magnetic field to trap high-energy charged particles and form radiation belts, which have been observed outside its rings. Whether stable radiation belts exist near the planet and inward of the rings was previously unknown. The Cassini spacecraft’s Magnetosphere Imaging Instrument obtained measurements of a radiation belt that lies just above Saturn’s dense atmosphere and is decoupled from the rest of the magnetosphere by the planet’s A- to C-rings. The belt extends across the D-ring and comprises <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s produced through cosmic ray albedo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> decay and multiple charge-exchange reactions. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s are lost to atmospheric neutrals and D-ring dust.

Light curves of the neutron star merger GW170817/SSS17a: Implications for r-process nucleosynthesis
<p>On 17 August 2017, gravitational waves (GWs) were detected from a binary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the ejection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong>-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star mergers play a role in rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

Illuminating gravitational waves: A concordant picture of photons from a neutron star merger
<p>Merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> stars offer an excellent laboratory for simultaneously studying strong-field gravity and matter in extreme environments. We establish the physical association of an electromagnetic counterpart (EM170817) with gravitational waves (GW170817) detected from merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> stars. By synthesizing a panchromatic data set, we demonstrate that merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> stars are a long-sought production site forging heavy elements by r-process nucleosynthesis. The weak gamma rays seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-ray bursts with ultrarelativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet explains the low-luminosity gamma rays, the high-luminosity ultraviolet-optical-infrared, and the delayed radio and x-ray emission. We posit that all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star mergers may lead to a wide-angle cocoon breakout, sometimes accompanied by a successful jet and sometimes by a choked jet.</p>

Structure, mechanism, and regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase

The flexible peripheral stalk redistributes differences in torsional energy across three unequal steps in the rotation cycle.

Energy powerhouses of cells come into focus

Two articles in this issue report structures of membrane-embedded ATP synthases from yeast mitochondria [Srivastava <i>et al.</i>, page 619, (<i>1</i>)] and spinach chloroplasts [Hahn <i>et al.</i>, page 620, (<i>2</i>)]. Together with other recent structures, these articles define core design principles of rotary ATP synthases and ATPases but also highlight organism-specific differences.</p>

Double-trap measurement of the proton magnetic moment at 0.3 parts per billion precision
<p>Precise knowledge of the fundamental properties of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> is essential for our understanding of atomic structure as well as for precise tests of fundamental symmetries. We report on a direct high-precision measurement of the magnetic moment μ<sub>p</sub> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> in units of the nuclear magneton μ<sub>N</sub>. The result, μ<sub>p</sub> = 2.79284734462 (±0.00000000082) μ<sub>N</sub>, has a fractional precision of 0.3 parts per billion, improves the previous best measurement by a factor of 11, and is consistent with the currently accepted value. This was achieved with the use of an optimized double–Penning trap technique.

Atomic model for the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> region of mitochondrial ATP synthase
<p>Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase produces the majority of ATP in eukaryotic cells, and its dimerization is necessary to create the inner membrane folds, or cristae, characteristic of mitochondria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> translocation through the membrane-embedded F<sub>O</sub> region turns the rotor that drives ATP synthesis in the soluble F<sub>1</sub> region. Although crystal structures of the F<sub>1</sub> region have illustrated how this rotation leads to ATP synthesis, understanding how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> translocation produces the rotation has been impeded by the lack of an experimental atomic model for the F<sub>O</sub> region. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structure of the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> complex from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> at a resolution of 3.6 angstroms. The structure clarifies how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s travel through the complex, how the complex dimerizes, and how the dimers bend the membrane to produce cristae.</p>

Spectroscopic snapshots of the proton-transfer mechanism in water
<p>The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> mobility in water as a sequence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfers along a hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) network.

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Compact radio emission indicates a structured jet was produced by a binary neutron star merger
<p>The binary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star merger event GW170817 was detected through both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves. Its afterglow emission may have been produced by either a narrow relativistic jet or an isotropic outflow. High-spatial-resolution measurements of the source size and displacement can discriminate between these scenarios. We present very-long-baseline interferometry observations, performed 207.4 days after the merger by using a global network of 32 radio telescopes. The apparent source size is constrained to be smaller than 2.5 milli–arc seconds at the 90% confidence level. This excludes the isotropic outflow scenario, which would have produced a larger apparent size, indicating that GW170817 produced a structured relativistic jet. Our rate calculations show that at least 10% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star mergers produce such a jet.</p>

Supersymmetric laser arrays

A designed heme-[4Fe-4S] metalloenzyme catalyzes sulfite reduction like the native enzyme
<p>Multielectron redox reactions often require multicofactor metalloenzymes to facilitate coupled electron and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> movement, but it is challenging to design artificial enzymes to catalyze these important reactions, owing to their structural and functional complexity. We report a designed heteronuclear heme-[4Fe-4S] cofactor in cytochrome <i>c</i> peroxidase as a structural and functional model of the enzyme sulfite reductase. The initial model exhibits spectroscopic and ligand-binding properties of the native enzyme, and sulfite reduction activity was improved—through rational tuning of the secondary sphere interactions around the [4Fe-4S] and the substrate-binding sites—to be close to that of the native enzyme. By offering insight into the requirements for a demanding six-electron, seven-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> reaction that has so far eluded synthetic catalysts, this study provides strategies for designing highly functional multicofactor artificial enzymes.</p>

Activation of olefins via asymmetric Brønsted acid catalysis

Although chemists have recently designed chiral Brønsted acid catalysts to activate imines and carbonyl compounds, mimicking these enzymes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>ate simple olefins that then engage in asymmetric catalytic reactions has remained a substantial synthetic challenge. Here, we show that a class of confined and strong chiral Brønsted acids enables the catalytic asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of unbiased olefins.

Electromagnetic evidence that SSS17a is the result of a binary neutron star merger
<p>Eleven hours after the detection of gravitational wave source GW170817 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Virgo Interferometers, an associated optical transient, SSS17a, was identified in the galaxy NGC 4993. Although the gravitational wave data indicate that GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints on the nature of that system. We synthesize the optical to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> capture (the r-process).

Early spectra of the gravitational wave source GW170817: Evolution of a neutron star merger

Applying blackbody fits to the spectra, we measured the photosphere cooling from [Formula] to [Formula] kelvin, and determined a photospheric velocity of roughly 30% of the speed of light. The spectra of SSS17a began displaying broad features after 1.46 days and evolved qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) components. The late-time component is consistent with theoretical models of r-process–enriched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star ejecta, whereas the blue component requires high-velocity, lanthanide-free material.</p>

Extended gamma-ray sources around pulsars constrain the origin of the positron flux at Earth

The HAWC observations demonstrate that these pulsars are indeed local sources of accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lepton</span></strong>s, but the measured tera–electron volt emission profile constrains the diffusion of particles away from these sources to be much slower than previously assumed.

Unusual Roles of Secretory SNARE SYP132 in Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Traffic and Vegetative Plant Growth
<p>The plasma membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> (H<sup>+</sup>)-ATPases of plants generate steep electrochemical gradients and activate osmotic solute uptake. H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> pumping orchestrates cellular homeostasis and is a prerequisite for plastic cell expansion and plant growth. All evidence suggests that the population of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma membrane reflects a balance of their roles in exocytosis, endocytosis, and recycling. Auxin governs both traffic and activation of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins already present at the membrane. As in other eukaryotes, in plants, SNARE-mediated membrane traffic influences the density of several proteins at the plasma membrane. Even so, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic, its relationship with SNAREs, and its regulation by auxin have remained enigmatic. Here, we identify the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Qa-SNARE SYP132 (Syntaxin of Plants132) as a key factor in H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and demonstrate its association with endocytosis. SYP132 is a low-abundant, secretory SNARE that primarily localizes to the plasma membrane. We find that <i>SYP132</i> expression is tightly regulated by auxin and that augmented SYP132 expression reduces the amount of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma membrane. The physiological consequences of SYP132 overexpression include reduced apoplast acidification and suppressed vegetative growth. Thus, SYP132 plays unexpected and vital roles in auxin-regulated H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and associated functions at the plasma membrane.</p>

Growth at Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Requires Acclimation of the Respiratory Chain to Support Photosynthesis
<p>Plants will experience an elevated atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (ECO<sub>2</sub>) in the future. Growth of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) at ECO<sub>2</sub> more than doubled the leaf protein amount of alternative oxidase (AOX), a non-energy-conserving component of mitochondrial respiration. To test the functional significance of this AOX increase, wild-type tobacco was compared with AOX knockdown and overexpression lines, following growth at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or ECO<sub>2</sub>. The ECO<sub>2</sub>-grown AOX knockdowns had a reduced capacity for triose phosphate use (TPU) during photosynthesis compared with the other plant lines. This TPU limitation of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation was associated with an increased accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate, sucrose, and starch in the leaves of the knockdowns. Under TPU-limiting conditions, the size of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> gradient and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force across the thylakoid membrane was enhanced in the knockdowns relative to the other plant lines, suggesting a restriction of chloroplast ATP synthase activity. This restriction was not due to a decline in ATP synthase (AtpB) protein amount. The knockdowns also displayed a photosystem stoichiometry adjustment at ECO<sub>2</sub>, which was absent in the other plant lines. Additional experiments showed that the way in which AOX supports photosynthesis at ECO<sub>2</sub> is distinct from its previously described role in supporting photosynthesis during water deficit. The results are discussed in terms of how AOX contributes to TPU capacity and the maintenance of chloroplast ATP synthase activity at ECO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the evidence suggests that AOX respiration is needed to maintain both the carbon and energy balance in photosynthetic tissues during growth at ECO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

Flavodiiron-Mediated O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction Links H<sub>2</sub> Production with CO<sub>2</sub> Fixation during the Anaerobic Induction of Photosynthesis
<p>Some microalgae, such as <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, harbor a highly flexible photosynthetic apparatus capable of using different electron acceptors, including carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s, or oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), allowing survival in diverse habitats. During anaerobic induction of photosynthesis, molecular O<sub>2</sub> is produced at photosystem II, while at the photosystem I acceptor side, the reduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s into hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) by the plastidial [FeFe]-hydrogenases primes CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Although the interaction between H<sub>2</sub> production and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation has been studied extensively, their interplay with O<sub>2</sub> produced by photosynthesis has not been considered. By simultaneously measuring gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence, we identified an O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction mechanism that functions during anaerobic dark-to-light transitions and demonstrate that flavodiiron proteins (Flvs) are the major players involved in light-dependent O<sub>2</sub> uptake. We further show that Flv-mediated O<sub>2</sub> uptake is critical for the rapid induction of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation but is not involved in the creation of the micro-oxic niches proposed previously to protect the [FeFe]-hydrogenase from O<sub>2</sub>. By studying a mutant lacking both hydrogenases (HYDA1 and HYDA2) and both Flvs (FLVA and FLVB), we show that the induction of photosynthesis is strongly delayed in the absence of both sets of proteins. Based on these data, we propose that Flvs are involved in an important intracellular O<sub>2</sub> recycling process, which acts as a relay between H<sub>2</sub> production and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation.</p>

Flavodiiron Protein Substitutes for Cyclic Electron Flow without Competing CO<sub>2</sub> Assimilation in Rice
<p>Flavodiiron protein (FLV) mediates photoreduction of O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O. It is conserved from cyanobacteria to gymnosperms but not in angiosperms. The introduction of a moss (<i>Physcomitrella patens</i>) <i>FLV</i> (<i>PpFLV</i>) gene into Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) made photosystem I (PSI) resistant to fluctuating light. Here, we used the same strategy with three rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genotypes. PpFLV in the wild-type rice background functioned as an efficient PSI electron sink and increased resistance to PSI photodamage under fluctuating light. The introduction of PpFLV into the <i>PGR5</i>-RNAi mutant [defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> GRADIENT REGULATION5 (PGR5)-dependent cyclic electron transport around PSI, CET-PSI], the <i>crr6</i> mutant [defective in chloroplast NAD(P)H-dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH)-dependent CET-PSI], and the <i>PGR5</i>-RNAi <i>crr6</i> double mutant (double defective in CET-PSI activity) alleviated PSI photodamage under fluctuating light. Furthermore, PpFLV substituted for the function of PGR5- and NDH-dependent CET-PSI without competing for CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation under constant light, as there was no difference in CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation per Rubisco content and biomass production was recovered to the wild-type level. Thus, the exogenous FLV system could act not only as a safety valve under fluctuating light, but also generate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force for balancing the ATP/NADPH production ratio during steady-state photosynthesis.</p>

Environmental and Genetic Factors Regulating Localization of the Plant Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase
<p>A P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is the primary transporter that converts ATP to electrochemical energy at the plasma membrane of higher plants. Its product, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-motive force, is composed of an electrical potential and a pH gradient. Many studies have demonstrated that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-motive force not only drives the secondary transporters required for nutrient uptake, but also plays a direct role in regulating cell expansion. Here, we have generated a transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plant expressing H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2) that is translationally fused with a fluorescent protein and examined its cellular localization by live-cell microscopy. Using a 3D imaging approach with seedlings grown for various times under a variety of light intensities, we demonstrate that AHA2 localization at the plasma membrane of root cells requires light. In dim light conditions, AHA2 is found in intracellular compartments, in addition to the plasma membrane. This localization profile was age-dependent and specific to cell types found in the transition zone located between the meristem and elongation zones. The accumulation of AHA2 in intracellular compartments is consistent with reduced H<sup>+</sup> secretion near the transition zone and the suppression of root growth. By examining AHA2 localization in a knockout mutant of a receptor protein kinase, FERONIA, we found that the intracellular accumulation of AHA2 in the transition zone is dependent on a functional FERONIA-dependent inhibitory response in root elongation. Overall, this study provides a molecular underpinning for understanding the genetic, environmental, and developmental factors influencing root growth via localization of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p>

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with elongation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial gradients for elongation rate, osmotic pressure, cell wall thickness, and wall mechanical compliances and coupled these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the polysaccharide composition, mobility, hydration, and intermolecular interactions of the inflorescence cell wall using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> scattering. Force-extension curves revealed a gradient, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong>-scattering curves showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal gradient in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

Identification of Homogentisate Dioxygenase as a Target for Vitamin E Biofortification in Oilseeds
<p>Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a major plant source of protein and oil and produces important secondary metabolites beneficial for human health. As a tool for gene function discovery and improvement of this important crop, a mutant population was generated using fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> irradiation. Visual screening of mutagenized seeds identified a mutant line, designated MO12, which produced brown seeds as opposed to the yellow seeds produced by the unmodified Williams 82 parental cultivar. Using forward genetic methods combined with comparative genome hybridization analysis, we were able to establish that deletion of the <i>GmHGO1</i> gene is the genetic basis of the brown seeded phenotype exhibited by the MO12 mutant line. <i>GmHGO1</i> encodes a homogentisate dioxygenase (HGO), which catalyzes the committed enzymatic step in homogentisate catabolism. This report describes to our knowledge the first functional characterization of a plant <i>HGO</i> gene, defects of which are linked to the human genetic disease alkaptonuria. We show that reduced homogentisate catabolism in a soybean <i>HGO</i> mutant is an effective strategy for enhancing the production of lipid-soluble antioxidants such as vitamin E, as well as tolerance to herbicides that target pathways associated with homogentisate metabolism. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> mutagenesis in identifying novel genes that contribute to soybean agronomic traits.</p>

Nitrogen fixation and reduction at boron
<p>Currently, the only compounds known to support fixation and functionalization of dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) under nonmatrix conditions are based on metals. Here we present the observation of N<sub>2</sub> binding and reduction by a nonmetal, specifically a dicoordinate borylene. Depending on the reaction conditions under which potassium graphite is introduced as a reductant, N<sub>2</sub> binding to two borylene units results in either neutral (B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>) or dianionic ([B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2–</sup>) products that can be interconverted by respective exposure to further reductant or to air.

Coherent band excitations in CePd<sub>3</sub>: A comparison of neutron scattering and ab initio theory

We show that inelastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> scattering measurements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of CePd<sub>3</sub> provides a benchmark for ab initio calculations based on dynamical mean field theory. The magnetic response is strongly momentum dependent thanks to the formation of coherent f-electron bands at low temperature, with an amplitude that is strongly enhanced by local particle-hole interactions. The agreement between experiment and theory shows that we have a robust first-principles understanding of the temperature dependence of f-electron coherence.</p>

A radio counterpart to a neutron star merger

We report the detection of a counterpart radio source that appears 16 days after the event, allowing us to diagnose the energetics and environment of the merger. The observed radio emission can be explained by either a collimated ultrarelativistic jet, viewed off-axis, or a cocoon of mildly relativistic ejecta. Within 100 days of the merger, the radio light curves will enable observers to distinguish between these models, and the angular velocity and geometry of the debris will be directly measurable by very long baseline interferometry.</p>

Observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
<p>The coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos off nuclei has eluded detection for four decades, even though its predicted cross section is by far the largest of all low-energy neutrino couplings. This mode of interaction offers new opportunities to study neutrino properties and leads to a miniaturization of detector size, with potential technological applications. We observed this process at a 6.7σ confidence level, using a low-background, 14.6-kilogram CsI[Na] scintillator exposed to the neutrino emissions from the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Characteristic signatures in energy and time, predicted by the standard model for this process, were observed in high signal-to-background conditions. Improved constraints on nonstandard neutrino interactions with quarks are derived from this initial data set.</p>

Neutron scattering in the proximate quantum spin liquid α-RuCl<sub>3</sub>

We used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> scattering on single crystals of α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> to reconstruct dynamical correlations in energy-momentum space. We discovered highly unusual signals, including a column of scattering over a large energy interval around the Brillouin zone center, which is very stable with temperature. This finding is consistent with scattering from the Majorana excitations of a KQSL. Other, more delicate experimental features can be transparently associated with perturbations to an ideal model. Our results encourage further study of this prototypical material and may open a window into investigating emergent magnetic Majorana fermions in correlated materials.</p>

The complex effects of ocean acidification on the prominent N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacterium <i>Trichodesmium</i>
<p>Acidification of seawater caused by anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is anticipated to influence the growth of dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>)–fixing phytoplankton, which contribute a large fraction of primary production in the tropical and subtropical ocean. We found that growth and N<sub>2</sub>-fixation of the ubiquitous cyanobacterium <i>Trichodesmium</i> decreased under acidified conditions, notwithstanding a beneficial effect of high CO<sub>2</sub>. Acidification resulted in low cytosolic pH and reduced N<sub>2</sub>-fixation rates despite elevated nitrogenase concentrations. Low cytosolic pH required increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> pumping across the thylakoid membrane and elevated adenosine triphosphate production.

Linking Duplication of a Calcium Sensor to Salt Tolerance in <i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>
<p>The SALT-OVERLY-SENSITIVE (SOS) pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) functions to prevent the toxic accumulation of sodium in the cytosol when plants are grown in salt-affected soils. In this pathway, the CALCINEURIN B-LIKE10 (AtCBL10) calcium sensor interacts with the AtSOS2 kinase to activate the AtSOS1 plasma membrane sodium/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> exchanger. <i>CBL10</i> has been duplicated in Eutrema (<i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>), a salt-tolerant relative of Arabidopsis. Because Eutrema maintains growth in salt-affected soils that kill most crop plants, the duplication of <i>CBL10</i> provides a unique opportunity to functionally test the outcome of gene duplication and its link to plant salt tolerance. In Eutrema, individual down-regulation of the duplicated <i>CBL10</i> genes (<i>EsCBL10a</i> and <i>EsCBL10b</i>) decreased growth in the presence of salt and, in combination, led to an even greater decrease, suggesting that both genes function in response to salt and have distinct functions. Cross-species complementation assays demonstrated that <i>EsCBL10b</i> has an enhanced ability to activate the SOS pathway while <i>EsCBL10a</i> has a function not performed by <i>AtCBL10</i> or <i>EsCBL10b</i>. Chimeric EsCBL10a/EsCBL10b proteins revealed that the specific functions of the EsCBL10 proteins resulted from changes in the amino terminus. The duplication of <i>CBL10</i> increased calcium-mediated signaling capacity in Eutrema and conferred increased salt tolerance to salt-sensitive Arabidopsis.</p>

PGR5-Dependent Cyclic Electron Flow Protects Photosystem I under Fluctuating Light at Donor and Acceptor Sides
<p>In response to a sudden increase in light intensity, plants must cope with absorbed excess photon energy to protect photosystems from photodamage. Under fluctuating light, PSI is severely photodamaged in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> gradient regulation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutant defective in the main pathway of PSI cyclic electron transport (CET). Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed regulatory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) reservation of electron sink capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH production ratio (acceptor-side regulation) and (2) down-regulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic control for slowing down the electron flow toward PSI (donor-side regulation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> backgrounds by introducing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hypersensitivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to luminal acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic control partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant background but restricted linear electron transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic control should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large electron sink and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic control. Thus, donor-side regulation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side regulation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side regulation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

Genetic Dissection of Fe-Dependent Signaling in Root Developmental Responses to Phosphate Deficiency
<p>The inhibition of primary root (PR) growth is a major developmental response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Previous studies have independently uncovered key roles of the LOW PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (LPR1) ferroxidase, the tonoplast-localized ALUMINUM SENSITIVE3 (ALS3)/SENSITIVE TO ALUMINUM RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STAR1) transporter complex, and the SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1; a transcription factor)-ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (ALMT1; a malate transporter) regulatory module in mediating this response by controlling iron (Fe) homeostasis in roots, but how these three components interact to regulate PR growth under Pi deficiency remains unknown. Here, we dissected genetic relationships among these three key components and found that (1) STOP1, ALMT1, and LPR1 act downstream of ALS3/STAR1 in controlling PR growth under Pi deficiency; (2) ALS3/STAR1 inhibits the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway by repressing STOP1 protein accumulation in the nucleus; and (3) STOP1-ALMT1 and LPR1 control PR growth under Pi deficiency in an interdependent manner involving the promotion of malate-dependent Fe accumulation in roots. Furthermore, this malate-mediated Fe accumulation depends on external Pi availability. We also performed a detailed analysis of the dynamic changes in the tissue-specific Fe accumulation patterns in the root tips of plants exposed to Pi deficiency. The results indicate that the degree of inhibition of PR growth induced by Pi deficiency is not linked to the level of Fe accumulated in the root apical meristem or the elongation zone. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism that regulates the root developmental response to Pi deficiency.</p>

Reduced Arogenate Dehydratase Expression: Ramifications for Photosynthesis and Metabolism
<p>Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) biosynthesis. Previous work showed that ADT-deficient Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants had significantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger reductions in lines that had deficiencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by analyzing Arabidopsis <i>ADT</i> mutants using our phenomics facility and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we describe the effects of the modulation of ADT on photosynthetic parameters and secondary metabolism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon flux into Phe biosynthesis in <i>ADT</i> mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron transport rates is caused by an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force across the thylakoid membrane that down-regulates photosystem II activity by the high-energy quenching mechanism. Furthermore, quantitation of secondary metabolites in <i>ADT</i> mutants revealed reduced flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, and glucosinolate contents, including glucosinolates that are not derived from aromatic amino acids, and significantly increased contents of putative galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Additionally, we used real-time atmospheric monitoring mass spectrometry to compare respiration and carbon fixation rates between the wild type and <i>adt3/4/5/6</i>, our most extreme <i>ADT</i> knockout mutant, which revealed no significant difference in both night- and day-adapted plants. Overall, these data reveal the profound effects of altered ADT activity and Phe metabolism on secondary metabolites and photosynthesis with implications for plant improvement.</p>

The Impacts of Phosphorus Deficiency on the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain
<p>Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and P deficiency limits plant productivity. Recent work showed that P deficiency affects electron transport to photosystem I (PSI), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive biological model describing how P deficiency disrupts the photosynthetic machinery and the electron transport chain through a series of sequential events in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). P deficiency reduces the orthophosphate concentration in the chloroplast stroma to levels that inhibit ATP synthase activity. Consequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s accumulate in the thylakoids and cause lumen acidification, which inhibits linear electron flow. Limited plastoquinol oxidation retards electron transport to the cytochrome <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, yet the electron transfer rate of PSI is increased under steady-state growth light and is limited under high-light conditions. Under P deficiency, the enhanced electron flow through PSI increases the levels of NADPH, whereas ATP production remains restricted and, hence, reduces CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. In parallel, lumen acidification activates the energy-dependent quenching component of the nonphotochemical quenching mechanism and prevents the overexcitation of photosystem II and damage to the leaf tissue. Consequently, plants can be severely affected by P deficiency for weeks without displaying any visual leaf symptoms. All of the processes in the photosynthetic machinery influenced by P deficiency appear to be fully reversible and can be restored in less than 60 min after resupply of orthophosphate to the leaf tissue.</p>

Sugar Transporter STP7 Specificity for <sc>l</sc>-Arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-Xylose Contrasts with the Typical Hexose Transporters STP8 and STP12
<p>The controlled distribution of sugars between assimilate-exporting source tissues and sugar-consuming sink tissues is a key element for plant growth and development. Monosaccharide transporters of the SUGAR TRANSPORT PROTEIN (STP) family contribute to the uptake of sugars into sink cells. Here, we report on the characterization of STP7, STP8, and STP12, three previously uncharacterized members of this family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) revealed that STP8 and STP12 catalyze the high-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-dependent uptake of glucose and also accept galactose and mannose. STP12 additionally transports xylose. <i>STP8</i> and <i>STP12</i> are highly expressed in reproductive organs, where their protein products might contribute to sugar uptake into the pollen tube and the embryo sac. <i>stp8.1</i> and <i>stp12.1</i> T-DNA insertion lines developed normally, which may point toward functional redundancy with other STPs. In contrast to all other STPs, STP7 does not transport hexoses but is specific for the pentoses <sc>l</sc>-arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-xylose. <i>STP7-</i>promoter-reporter gene plants showed an expression of <i>STP7</i> especially in tissues with high cell wall turnover, indicating that STP7 might contribute to the uptake and recycling of cell wall sugars. Uptake analyses with radioactive <sc>l</sc>-arabinose revealed that 11 other STPs are able to transport <sc>l</sc>-arabinose with high affinity. Hence, functional redundancy might explain the missing-mutant phenotype of two <i>stp7</i> T-DNA insertion lines. Together, these data complete the characterization of the STP family and present the STPs as new <sc>l</sc>-arabinose transporters for potential biotechnological applications.</p>

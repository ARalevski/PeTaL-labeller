The influence of cartilage thickness at the sigmoid notch on inclination at the distal radioulnar joint
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were: firstly, to investigate the influence   of the thickness of cartilage at the sigmoid notch on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation   of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), and secondly, to compare   the sensitivity and specificity of MRI with plain radiographs for   the assessment of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation of the articular surface of the   DRUJ in the coronal plane. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Contemporaneous MRI images and radiographs of 100 wrists from   98 asymptomatic patients (mean age 43 years, (16 to 67); 52 male,   53%) with no history of a fracture involving the wrist or surgery   to the wrist, were reviewed. The thickness of the cartilage at the   sigmoid notch, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation of the DRUJ and Tolat Type of each DRUJ   were determined. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The assessment using MRI scans and cortical bone correlated well   with radiographs, with a kappa value of 0.83. The mean difference   between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation using the cortex and cartilage on MRI scans   was 12°, leading to a change of Tolat type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation in 66%   of wrists. No reverse oblique (Type 3) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ations were found when   using the cartilage to assess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>These data revealed that when measuring the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation of the   DRUJ using cartilage, reverse oblique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ations might not exist.   The data suggest that performing an ulna shortening osteotomy might   be reasonable even in distal radioulnar joints where the plain radiographic   appearance suggests an unfavourable reverse oblique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation   in the coronal plane. We recommend using MRI to validate radiographs   in those that appear to be reverse oblique (Tolat Type 3), as the   true <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation might be different, thereby removing one possible   contraindication to ulnar shortening.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:369–75.</p></sec>

Chemical responses to modified lignin composition in tension wood of hybrid poplar (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i>)
<p>The effect of altering the expression level of the <i>F5H</i> gene was investigated in three wood tissues (normal, opposite and tension wood) in 1-year-old hybrid poplar clone 717 (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i> L.), containing the <i>F5H</i> gene under the control of the <i>C4H</i> promoter. Elevated expression of the <i>F5H</i> gene in poplar has been previously reported to increase the percent syringyl content of lignin. The wild-type and three transgenic lines were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ed 45° for 3 months to induce tension wood formation. Tension and opposite wood from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ed trees, along with normal wood from control trees, were analyzed separately for carbohydrates, lignin, cellulose crystallinity and microfibril angle (MFA). In the wild-type poplar, the lignin in tension wood contained a significantly higher percentage of syringyl than normal wood or opposite wood. However, there was no significant difference in the percent syringyl content of the three wood types within each of the transgenic lines. Increasing the <i>F5H</i> gene expression caused an increase in the percent syringyl content and a slight decrease in the total lignin in normal wood. In tension wood, the addition of a gelatinous layer in the fiber walls resulted in a consistently lower percentage of total lignin in the tissue. Acid-soluble lignin was observed to increase by up to 2.3-fold in the transgenic lines. Compared with normal wood and opposite wood, cell wall crystallinity in tension wood was higher and the MFA was smaller, as expected, with no evidence of an effect from modifying the syringyl monomer ratio. Tension wood in all the lines contained consistently higher total sugar and glucose percentages when compared with normal wood within the respective lines. However, both sugar and glucose percentages were lower in the tension wood of transgenic lines when compared with the tension wood of wild-type trees. Evaluating the response of trees with altered syringyl content to gravity will improve our understanding of the changes in cell wall chemistry and ultrastructural properties of normal, opposite and tension wood in plants.</p>

Saturn’s magnetic field revealed by the Cassini Grand Finale
<p>During 2017, the Cassini fluxgate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetomet</span></strong>er made in situ measurements of Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic field</span></strong> at distances ~2550 ± 1290 kilometers above the 1-bar surface during 22 highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ed Grand Finale orbits. These observations refine the extreme axisymmetry of Saturn’s internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic field</span></strong> and show displacement of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic equ</span></strong>ator northward from the planet’s physical equator. Persistent small-scale magnetic structures, corresponding to high-degree (>3) axisymmetric magnetic moments, were observed. This suggests secondary shallow dynamo action in the semiconducting region of Saturn’s interior. Some high-degree magnetic moments could arise from strong high-latitude concentrations of magnetic flux within the planet’s deep dynamo. A strong field-aligned current (FAC) system is located between Saturn and the inner edge of its D-ring, with strength comparable to the high-latitude auroral FACs.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Rice atypical HLH protein <i>Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1</i>-<i>LIKE1</i> (<i>OsBUL1</i>) is preferentially expressed in the lamina joint where it controls cell elongation and positively affects leaf angles. <i>OsBUL1</i> knockout mutant (<i>osbul1</i>) and transgenic rice for double-stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) of <i>OsBUL1</i> produced erect leaves with smaller grains, whereas <i>OsBUL1</i> overexpressors and an activation tagging line of <i>OsBUL1</i> exhibited increased lamina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation and grain size. Moreover, <i>OsBUL1</i> expression was induced by brassinolide (BL) and <i>osbul1</i> did not respond to BL treatment. To understand the molecular network of OsBUL1 function in rice, we isolated a novel OsBUL1-interacting protein, LO9-177, an uncharacterized protein containing a KxDL motif, and functionally studied it with respect to the lamina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation and grain size of rice. OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the lamina joint of rice. Expression of <i>OsBC1</i> is also upregulated by BL and has a similar pattern to that of <i>OsBUL1</i>. Transgenic rice plants expressing <i>OsBC1</i> under the control of <i>OsBUL1</i> promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending, while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of <i>OsBC1</i> displayed reduced plant height and grain size. Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177, and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system, providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation.</p>

Prediction of the pre-morbid 3D anatomy of the proximal humerus based on statistical shape modelling
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Restoring the pre-morbid anatomy of the proximal humerus is a   goal of anatomical shoulder arthroplasty, but reliance is placed   on the surgeon’s experience and on anatomical estimations. The purpose   of this study was to present a novel method, ‘Statistical Shape   Modelling’, which accurately predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy   and calculates the 3D geometric parameters needed to restore normal   anatomy in patients with severe degenerative osteoarthritis or a   fracture of the proximal humerus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>From a database of 57 humeral CT scans 3D humeral reconstructions   were manually created. The reconstructions were used to construct   a statistical shape model (SSM), which was then tested on a second   set of 52 scans. For each humerus in the second set, 3D reconstructions   of four diaphyseal segments of varying lengths were created. These   reconstructions were chosen to mimic severe osteoarthritis, a fracture   of the surgical neck of the humerus and a proximal humeral fracture   with diaphyseal extension. The SSM was then applied to the diaphyseal   segments to see how well it predicted proximal morphology, using   the actual proximal humeral morphology for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the errors   of prediction for retroversion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation, height, radius of curvature   and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were   2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm),   0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the   metaphysis excluded, mimicking a fracture of the surgical neck,   the errors of prediction for retroversion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation, height, radius   of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the   humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3   mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm    (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports a novel, computerised method that accurately   predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy even in challenging   situations.

An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of measuring anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used different definitions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for misinterpretation of the   results. We compared the reliability and accuracy of five current   methods using plain radiographs (those of Lewinnek, Widmer, Liaw,   Pradhan, and Woo and Morrey) with CT measurements, using the same   definition and reference plane. We retrospectively studied the plain   radiographs and CT scans in 84 hips of 84 patients who underwent   primary THR. Intra- and inter-observer reliability were high for   the measurement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation and anteversion with all methods   on plain radiographs and CT scans. The measurements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation on   plain radiographs were similar to the measurements using CT (p =   0.043). The mean difference between CT measurements was 0.6° (-5.9°   to 6.8°).</p><p>Measurements using Widmer’s method were the most similar to those   using CT (p = 0.088), with a mean difference between CT measurements   of -0.9° (-10.4° to 9.1°), whereas the other four methods differed   significantly from those using CT (p < 0.001).</p><p>This study has shown that Widmer’s method is the best for evaluating   the anteversion of the acetabular component on plain radiographs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:597–603.</p>

The low-frequency source of Saturn’s kilometric radiation
<p>Understanding how auroral radio emissions are produced by magnetized bodies requires in situ measurements within their source region. Saturn’s kilometric radiation (SKR) has been widely used as a remote proxy of Saturn’s magnetosphere. We present wave and plasma measurements from the Cassini spacecraft during its ring-grazing high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>ation orbits, which passed three times through the high-altitude SKR emission region. Northern dawn-side, narrow-banded radio sources were encountered at frequencies of 10 to 20 kilohertz, within regions of upward currents mapping to the ultraviolet auroral oval. The kilometric waves were produced on the extraordinary mode by the cyclotron maser instability from 6– to 12–kilo–electron volt electron beams and radiated quasi-perpendicularly to the auroral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic field</span></strong> lines. The SKR low-frequency sources appear to be strongly controlled by time-variable magnetospheric electron densities.</p>

Assessing whether the 2017 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 5.4 Pohang earthquake in South Korea was an induced event

Topological origin of equatorial waves
<p>Topology sheds new light on the emergence of unidirectional edge waves in a variety of physical systems, from condensed matter to artificial lattices. Waves observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical flows are also robust to perturbations, which suggests a role for topology. We show a topological origin for two well-known equatorially trapped waves, the Kelvin and Yanai modes, owing to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by Earth’s rotation. The nontrivial structure of the bulk PoincaréÉééé wave modes encoded through the first Chern number of value 2 guarantees the existence of these waves. This invariant demonstrates that ocean and atmospheric waves share fundamental properties with topological insulators and that topology plays an unexpected role in Earth’s climate system.</p>

Ten-month-old infants infer the value of goals from the costs of actions
<p>Infants understand that people pursue goals, but how do they learn which goals people prefer? We tested whether infants solve this problem by inverting a mental model of action planning, trading off the costs of acting against the rewards actions bring. After seeing an agent attain two goals equally often at varying costs, infants expected the agent to prefer the goal it attained through costlier actions. These expectations held across three experiments that conveyed cost through different physical path features (height, width, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inclin</span></strong>e angle), suggesting that an abstract variable—such as “force,” “work,” or “effort”—supported infants’ inferences. We modeled infants’ expectations as Bayesian inferences over utility-theoretic calculations, providing a bridge to recent quantitative accounts of action understanding in older children and adults.</p>

The turbulent cascade in five dimensions
<p>To the naked eye, turbulent flows exhibit whirls of many different sizes. To each size, or scale, corresponds a fraction of the total energy resulting from a cascade in five dimensions: scale, time, and three-dimensional space. Understanding this process is critical to strategies for modeling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical and industrial flows. By tracking the flow regions containing energy in different scales, we have detected the statistical predominance of a cross-scale link whereby fluid lumps of energy at scale Δ appear within lumps of scale 2Δ and die within those of scale Δ/2. Our approach uncovers the energy cascade in a simple water-like fluid, offering insights for turbulence models while paving the way for similar analyses in conducting fluids, quantum fluids, and plasmas.</p>

A unified continental thickness from seismology and diamonds suggests a melt-defined plate
<p>Thick, rigid continents move over the weaker underlying mantle, although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical and geochemical constraints on the exact thickness and defining mechanism of the continental plates are widely discrepant. Xenoliths suggest a chemical continental lithosphere ~175 kilometers thick, whereas seismic tomography supports a much thicker root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled <i>SS</i> precursor waveforms from continental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at depths of 130 to 190 kilometers. The discontinuity depth is well correlated with the origin depths of diamond-bearing xenoliths and corresponds to the transition from coarse to deformed xenoliths. At this depth, the xenolith-derived geotherm also intersects the carbonate-silicate solidus, suggesting that partial melt defines the plate boundaries beneath the continental interior.</p>

Massive blow-out craters formed by hydrate-controlled methane expulsion from the Arctic seafloor
<p>Widespread methane release from thawing Arctic gas hydrates is a major concern, yet the processes, sources, and fluxes involved remain unconstrained. We present <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical data documenting a cluster of kilometer-wide craters and mounds from the Barents Sea floor associated with large-scale methane expulsion. Combined with ice sheet/gas hydrate modeling, our results indicate that during glaciation, natural gas migrated from underlying hydrocarbon reservoirs and was sequestered extensively as subglacial gas hydrates. Upon ice sheet retreat, methane from this hydrate reservoir concentrated in massive mounds before being abruptly released to form craters. We propose that these processes were likely widespread across past glaciated petroleum provinces and that they also provide an analog for the potential future destabilization of subglacial gas hydrate reservoirs beneath contemporary ice sheets.</p>

Submillihertz magnetic spectroscopy performed with a nanoscale quantum sensor
<p>Precise timekeeping is critical to metrology, forming the basis by which standards of time, length, and fundamental constants are determined. Stable clocks are particularly valuable in spectroscopy because they define the ultimate frequency precision that can be reached. In quantum metrology, the qubit coherence time defines the clock stability, from which the spectral linewidth and frequency precision are determined. We demonstrate a quantum sensing protocol in which the spectral precision goes beyond the sensor coherence time and is limited by the stability of a classical clock. Using this technique, we observed a precision in frequency estimation scaling in time <i>T</i> as <i>T</i><sup>–3/2</sup> for classical oscillating fields. The narrow linewidth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetomet</span></strong>er based on single spins in diamond is used to sense nanoscale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic field</span></strong>s with an intrinsic frequency resolution of 607 microhertz, which is eight orders of magnitude narrower than the qubit coherence time.</p>

Experimental constraints on the damp peridotite solidus and oceanic mantle potential temperature
<p>Decompression of hot mantle rock upwelling beneath oceanic spreading centers causes it to exceed the melting point (solidus), producing magmas that ascend to form basaltic crust ~6 to 7 kilometers thick. The oceanic upper mantle contains ~50 to 200 micrograms per gram of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) dissolved in nominally anhydrous minerals, which—relative to its low concentration—has a disproportionate effect on the solidus that has not been quantified experimentally. Here, we present results from an experimental determination of the peridotite solidus containing known amounts of dissolved hydrogen. Our data reveal that the H<sub>2</sub>O-undersaturated peridotite solidus is hotter than previously thought. Reconciling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical observations of the melting regime beneath the East Pacific Rise with our experimental results requires that existing estimates for the oceanic upper mantle potential temperature be adjusted upward by about 60°C.</p>

Lifetime of the solar nebula constrained by meteorite paleomagnetism
<p>A key stage in planet formation is the evolution of a gaseous and magnetized solar nebula. However, the lifetime of the nebular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic field</span></strong> and nebula are poorly constrained. We present <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paleomagnet</span></strong>ic analyses of volcanic angrites demonstrating that they formed in a near-zero <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic field</span></strong> (<0.6 microtesla) at 4563.5 ± 0.1 million years ago, ~3.8 million years after solar system formation. This indicates that the solar nebula field, and likely the nebular gas, had dispersed by this time. This sets the time scale for formation of the gas giants and planet migration. Furthermore, it supports formation of chondrules after 4563.5 million years ago by non-nebular processes like planetesimal collisions. The core dynamo on the angrite parent body did not initiate until about 4 to 11 million years after solar system formation.</p>

Volcanic tremor and plume height hysteresis from Pavlof Volcano, Alaska
<p>The March 2016 eruption of Pavlof Volcano, Alaska, produced an ash plume that caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights in North America. The eruption generated strong tremor that was recorded by seismic and remote low-frequency acoustic (infrasound) stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array. The relationship between the tremor amplitudes and plume height changes considerably between the waxing and waning portions of the eruption. Similar hysteresis has been observed between seismic river noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and erosional processes in both rivers and volcanoes can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical data. We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the tremor source related to volcanic vent erosion. This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity.</p>

Disproportionation of (Mg,Fe)SiO<sub>3</sub> perovskite in Earth’s deep lower mantle
<p>The mineralogical constitution of the Earth’s mantle dictates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical and geochemical properties of this region. Previous models of a perovskite-dominant lower mantle have been built on the assumption that the entire lower mantle down to the top of the D″ layer contains ferromagnesian silicate [(Mg,Fe)SiO<sub>3</sub>] with nominally 10 mole percent Fe. On the basis of experiments in laser-heated diamond anvil cells, at pressures of 95 to 101 gigapascals and temperatures of 2200 to 2400 kelvin, we found that such perovskite is unstable; it loses its Fe and disproportionates to a nearly Fe-free MgSiO<sub>3</sub> perovskite phase and an Fe-rich phase with a hexagonal structure. This observation has implications for enigmatic seismic features beyond ~2000 kilometers depth and suggests that the lower mantle may contain previously unidentified major phases.</p>

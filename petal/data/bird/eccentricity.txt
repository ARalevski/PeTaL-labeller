Elongator Is Required for Root Stem Cell Maintenance by Regulating <i>SHORTROOT</i> Transcription
<p><i>SHORTROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>) is essential for stem cell maintenance and radial patterning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, but how its expression is regulated is unknown. Here, we report that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator complex, which consists of six subunits (ELP1 to ELP6), regulates the transcription of <i>SHR</i>. Depletion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator drastically reduced <i>SHR</i> expression and led to defective root stem cell maintenance and radial patterning. The importance of the nuclear localization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator for its functioning, together with the insensitivity of the <i>elp1</i> mutant to the transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation inhibitor 6-azauracil, and the direct interaction of the ELP4 subunit with the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, support the notion that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator plays important roles in transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Indeed, we found that ELP3 associates with the premessenger RNA of <i>SHR</i> and that mutation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator reduces the enrichment of RNA polymerase II on the <i>SHR</i> gene body. Moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator interacted in vivo with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4, a well-established transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation factor that is recruited to the <i>SHR</i> locus. Together, these results demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator acts in concert with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4 to regulate the transcription of <i>SHR</i>.</p>

Actin Reorganization Triggers Rapid Cell Elongation in Roots
<p>Root growth is controlled by mechanisms underlying cell division and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation, which respond to various internal and external factors. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), cells produced in the proximal meristem (PM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ate and differentiate in the transition zone (TZ) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation/differentiation zone (EDZ). Previous studies have demonstrated that endoreplication is involved in root cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation; however, the manner by which cells increase in length by more than 2-fold remains unknown. Here, we show that epidermal and cortical cells in Arabidopsis roots undergo two modes of rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation: the first rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation occurs at the border of the proximal meristem and the TZ, and the second mode occurs during the transition from the TZ to the EDZ. Our previous study showed that cytokinin signaling promotes endoreplication, which triggers the first rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Our cytological and genetic data revealed that the second rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation involves dynamic actin reorganization independent of endoreplication. Cytokinins promote actin bundling and the resultant second rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation through activating the signaling pathway involving the cytokinin receptors ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE3 (AHK3) and AHK4 and the B-type transcription factor ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR2. Our results suggest that cytokinins promote the two modes of rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation by controlling distinct cellular events: endoreplication and actin reorganization.</p>

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in bunch number, the number of fruits per bunch and oil dry weight per fruit. An integrative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the number of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch number and the fruit number per bunch. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in bunch number per month were mainly due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in fruit number per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the number of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation at the control level, without any major decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Energy-Signaling Hub SnRK1 Is Important for Sucrose-Induced Hypocotyl Elongation
<p>Emerging seedlings respond to environmental conditions such as light and temperature to optimize their establishment. Seedlings grow initially through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation of the hypocotyl, which is regulated by signaling pathways that integrate environmental information to regulate seedling development. The hypocotyls of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ate in response to sucrose. Here, we investigated the role of cellular sugar-sensing mechanisms in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation of hypocotyls in response to Suc. We focused upon the role of SnRK1, which is a sugar-signaling hub that regulates metabolism and transcription in response to cellular energy status. We also investigated the role of TPS1, which synthesizes the signaling sugar trehalose-6-P that is proposed to regulate SnRK1 activity. Under light/dark cycles, we found that Suc-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation did not occur in <i>tps1</i> mutants and overexpressors of KIN10 (AKIN10/SnRK1.1), a catalytic subunit of SnRK1. We demonstrate that the magnitude of Suc-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation depends on the day length and light intensity. We identified roles for auxin and gibberellin signaling in Suc-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation under short photoperiods. We found that Suc-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation under light/dark cycles does not involve another proposed sugar sensor, HEXOKINASE1, or the circadian oscillator. Our study identifies novel roles for KIN10 and TPS1 in mediating a signal that underlies Suc-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation in light/dark cycles.</p>

Coordinated Regulation of Hypocotyl Cell Elongation by Light and Ethylene through a Microtubule Destabilizing Protein<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Precise regulation of hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation is essential for plant growth and survival. Light suppresses hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation by degrading transcription factor phytochrome-interacting factor 3 (PIF3), whereas the phytohormone ethylene promotes hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation by activating PIF3. However, the underlying mechanisms regarding how these two pathways coordinate downstream effectors to mediate hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation are largely unclear. In this study, we identified the novel Microtubule-Destabilizing Protein 60 (MDP60), which plays a positive role in hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>); this effect is mediated through PIF3. Ethylene signaling up-regulates <i>MDP60</i> expression via PIF3 binding to the <i>MDP60</i> promoter. <i>MDP60</i> loss-of-function mutants exhibit much shorter hypocotyls, whereas <i>MDP60</i> overexpression significantly promotes hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation when grown in light compared to the control. MDP60 protein binds to microtubules in vitro and in vivo. The organization of cortical microtubules was significantly disrupted in <i>mdp60</i> mutant cells and <i>MDP60</i>-overexpressing seedlings. These findings indicate that MDP60 is an important mediator of hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. This study reveals a mechanism in which light and ethylene signaling coordinate <i>MDP60</i> expression to modulate hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation by altering cortical microtubules in Arabidopsis.</p>

Altered Expression of a Malate-Permeable Anion Channel, OsALMT4, Disrupts Mineral Nutrition
<p>Aluminum-activated malate transporters (ALMTs) form a family of anion channels in plants, but little is known about most of its members. This study examined the function of <i>OsALMT4</i> from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We show that <i>OsALMT4</i> is expressed in roots and shoots and that the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing (OX) <i>OsALMT4</i> released malate from the roots constitutively and had 2-fold higher malate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the xylem sap than nulls, indicating greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of malate in the apoplast. OX lines developed brown necrotic spots on the leaves that did not appear on nulls. These symptoms were not associated with altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of any mineral element in the leaves, although the OX lines had higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of Mn and B in their grain compared with nulls. While total leaf Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations were not different between the OX and null lines, Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the apoplast were greater in the OX plants. The OX lines also displayed increased expression of Mn transporters and were more sensitive to Mn toxicity than null plants. We showed that the growth of wild-type rice was unaffected by 100 µ<sc>m</sc> Mn in hydroponics but, when combined with 1 m<sc>m</sc> malate, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation inhibited growth. We conclude that increasing <i>OsALMT4</i> expression affected malate efflux and compartmentation within the tissues, which increased Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the apoplast of leaves and induced the toxicity symptoms. This study reveals new links between malate transport and mineral nutrition.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total hemoglobin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

Chemoattractant concentration–dependent tuning of ERK signaling dynamics in migrating neutrophils
<p>The directed migration (chemotaxis) of neutrophils toward the bacterial peptide <i>N</i>-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (<i>f</i>MLP) is a crucial process in immune defense against invading bacteria. While navigating through a gradient of increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of <i>f</i>MLP, neutrophils and neutrophil-like HL-60 cells switch from exhibiting directional migration at low <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations to exhibiting circuitous migration at high <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. The extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is implicated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ing this <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation–dependent switch in migration modes. We investigated the role and regulation of ERK signaling through single-cell analysis of neutrophil migration in response to different <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations over time. We found that ERK exhibited gradated, rather than all-or-none, responses to <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Maximal ERK activation occurred in response to about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP, and ERK inactivation was promoted by p38. Furthermore, we found that directional migration of neutrophils reached a maximal extent at about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP and that ERK, but not p38, was required for neutrophil migration. Thus, our data suggest that, in chemotactic neutrophils responding to <i>f</i>MLP, ERK displays gradated activation and p38-dependent inhibition and that these ERK dynamics promote neutrophil migration.</p>

Preassembled GPCR signaling complexes mediate distinct cellular responses to ultralow ligand concentrations
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of cell surface signaling proteins, participate in nearly all physiological processes, and are the targets of 30% of marketed drugs. Typically, nanomolar to micromolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand are used to activate GPCRs in experimental systems. We detected GPCR responses to a wide range of ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, from attomolar to millimolar, by measuring GPCR-stimulated production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with high spatial and temporal resolution. Mathematical modeling showed that femtomolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand activated, on average, 40% of the cells in a population provided that a cell was activated by one to two binding events. Furthermore, activation of the endogenous β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) and muscarinic acetylcholine M<sub>3</sub> receptor (M<sub>3</sub>R) by femtomolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand in cell lines and human cardiac fibroblasts caused sustained increases in nuclear translocation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and cytosolic protein kinase C (PKC) activity, respectively. These responses were spatially and temporally distinct from those that occurred in response to higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand and resulted in a distinct cellular proteomic profile. This highly sensitive signaling depended on the GPCRs forming preassembled, higher-order signaling complexes at the plasma membrane. Recognizing that GPCRs respond to ultralow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of neurotransmitters and hormones challenges established paradigms of drug action and provides a previously unappreciated aspect of GPCR activation that is quite distinct from that typically observed with higher ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations.</p>

Learning and attention reveal a general relationship between population activity and behavior
<p>Prior studies have demonstrated that correlated variability changes with cognitive processes that improve perceptual performance. We tested whether correlated variability covaries with subjects’ performance—whether performance improves quickly with attention or slowly with perceptual learning. We found a single, consistent relationship between correlated variability and behavioral performance, regardless of the time frame of correlated variability change. This correlated variability was oriented along the dimensions in population space used by the animal on a trial-by-trial basis to make decisions. That subjects’ choices were predicted by specific dimensions that were aligned with the correlated variability axis clarifies long-standing paradoxes about the relationship between shared variability and behavior.</p>

Natural Variation within a Species for Traits Underpinning C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>Engineering C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into C<sub>3</sub> crops could substantially increase their yield by alleviating photorespiratory losses. This objective is challenging because the C<sub>4</sub> pathway involves complex modifications to the biochemistry, cell biology, and anatomy of leaves. Forward genetics has provided limited insight into the mechanistic basis of these properties, and there have been no reports of significant quantitative intraspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion of C<sub>4</sub> attributes that would allow trait mapping. Here, we show that accessions of the C<sub>4</sub> species <i>Gynandropsis gynandra</i> collected from locations across Africa and Asia exhibit natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in key characteristics of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Variable traits include bundle sheath size and vein density, gas-exchange parameters, and carbon isotope discrimination associated with the C<sub>4</sub> state. The abundance of transcripts encoding core enzymes of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle also showed significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Traits relating to water use showed more quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion than those associated with carbon assimilation. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in these traits likely adapted the hydraulic system for increased water use efficiency rather than improving carbon fixation, indicating that selection pressure may drive C<sub>4</sub> diversity in <i>G. gynandra</i> by modifying water use rather than photosynthesis. The accessions analyzed can be easily crossed and produce fertile offspring. Our findings, therefore, indicate that natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion within this C<sub>4</sub> species is sufficiently large to allow genetic mapping of key C<sub>4</sub> traits and regulators.</p>

Highly variable chemical signatures over short spatial distances among Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) populations
<p>Understanding within-species variability in terpenoid content and composition is highly relevant for predicting species adaptive potential to biotic stresses, but there is still limited information on terpene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions even for widespread species. We studied the foliage content and composition of terpenoids, foliage structure, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L. in four Estonian sites ranging from dry forest to raised bog. In the bogs, samples were taken along the environmental gradient from drier margins towards wetter central parts. A chiral column was used to gain insight into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in terpene composition. We hypothesized that terpene contents increase and the composition becomes more diverse in more strongly N-limited sites (greater C/N ratio) and that terpene signatures cluster together in sub-sites with similar conditions (drier/wetter). Altogether 37 terpenes were quantified across the sites. Extremely large variability of terpene contents, 48–62% for monoterpenes and 61–89% for sesquiterpenes, was observed. According to the amounts of α-pinenes and (+)-3-carene, we distinguished two different ‘pine chemotypes’. Contrary to the hypothesis, terpene contents and variability were the greatest in the dry site with the lowest C/N ratio. However, individual terpenoids correlated differently with C or N in different sites, indicating site effects on terpene composition. Moreover, correlations between the terpenoids and C or N depended on the pine chemotype. The sub-sites with different water regime were more strongly clustered together within the site than across the sites. The study demonstrates extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in terpene contents and composition among the populations and over short spatial distances within the populations, suggesting a large among- and within-population adaptive capacity of <i>P. sylvestris</i>.</p>

Recurrent cortical circuits implement concentration-invariant odor coding
<p>Animals rely on olfaction to find food, attract mates, and avoid predators. To support these behaviors, they must be able to identify odors across different odorant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. The neural circuit operations that implement this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation invariance remain unclear. We found that despite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-dependence in the olfactory bulb (OB), representations of odor identity were preserved downstream, in the piriform cortex (PCx). The OB cells responding earliest after inhalation drove robust responses in sparse subsets of PCx neurons. Recurrent collateral connections broadcast their activation across the PCx, recruiting global feedback inhibition that rapidly truncated and suppressed cortical activity for the remainder of the sniff, discounting the impact of slower, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-dependent OB inputs. Eliminating recurrent collateral output amplified PCx odor responses rendered the cortex steeply <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-dependent and abolished <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-invariant identity decoding.</p>

Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant respiration can theoretically be fueled by and dependent upon an array of central metabolism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion found in respiratory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale screens revealed 2-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in nighttime leaf respiration rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural accession collection grown under common favorable conditions. R<sub>N</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental differences within the sampling regime. To pursue metabolic explanations for leaf R<sub>N</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, parallel metabolite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an accession, R<sub>N</sub> correlated strongly with stored carbon substrates, including starch and dicarboxylic acids, as well as sucrose, major amino acids, shikimate, and salicylic acid. Among different accessions, metabolite-R<sub>N</sub> correlations were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino acids but not stored carbon substrates. A complementary screen of the effect of exogenous metabolites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of substrates, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and substrate supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic nitrogen did not stimulate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited nighttime nitrogen assimilation. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely uncorrelated in mature leaves. These results indicate that differences in preceding daytime metabolic activities are the major source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled conditions.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) mediates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation growth of shoot tissues by promoting cell expansion. According to the acid growth theory proposed in the 1970s, auxin activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and promoting solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that auxin-induced <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation growth and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical properties, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of auxin-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of auxin for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation growth by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are specifically impaired in auxin-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. The time courses of auxin-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and auxin-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation growth were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit auxin-mediated expansion growth by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was death or lung transplantation.

Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial pressure were independently associated with death or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up.

Root diameter variations explained by anatomy and phylogeny of 50 tropical and temperate tree species
<p>Root diameter, a critical indicator of root physiological function, varies greatly among tree species, but the underlying mechanism of this high variability is unclear. Here, we sampled 50 tree species across tropical and temperate zones in China, and measured root morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between root diameter, cortical thickness and stele diameter among tree species in tropical and temperate forests, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both root morphological and anatomical traits with divergence time during species radiation. The results showed that root diameter was strongly affected by cortical thickness but less by stele diameter in both tropical and temperate species. Changes in cortical thickness explained over 90% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in root diameter for the first order, and ∼74–87% for the second and third orders. Thicker roots displayed greater cortical thickness and more cortical cell layers than thinner roots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that root diameter, cortical thickness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with divergence time at the family level, showing similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion trends in geological time. The results also suggested that trees tend to decrease their root cortical thickness rather than stele diameter during species radiation. The close linkage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in root morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 tree species should provide some insights into the mechanism of root diameter variability among tree species.</p>

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of carbohydrate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low temperatures on the carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large increases in the sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-temperature responses. When trees were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling accumulation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol accumulation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling accumulation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling accumulation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different temperature effects more closely, we compared the carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the temperatures when sufficient chilling accumulated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of accumulated chilling. Instead, as chilling accumulated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that carbohydrates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol accumulation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total carbohydrate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature responses on carbohydrate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

Control of potassium homeostasis is an essential function of the second messenger cyclic di-AMP in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>
<p>The second messenger cyclic di–adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is essential in the Gram-positive model organism <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and in related pathogenic bacteria. It controls the activity of the conserved <i>ydaO</i> riboswitch and of several proteins involved in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) uptake. We found that the YdaO protein was conserved among several different bacteria and provide evidence that YdaO functions as a K<sup>+</sup> transporter. Thus, we renamed the gene and protein KimA (K<sup>+</sup> importer A). Reporter activity assays indicated that expression beyond the c-di-AMP–responsive riboswitch of the <i>kimA</i> upstream regulatory region occurred only in bacteria grown in medium containing low K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicated that c-di-AMP accumulated in bacteria grown in the presence of high K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations but not in low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations.

Anti–parity-time symmetry in diffusive systems
<p>Various concepts related to parity-time symmetry, including anti–parity-time symmetry, have found broad applications in wave physics. Wave systems are fundamentally described by Hermitian operators, whereas their unusual properties are introduced by incorporation of gain and loss. We propose that the related physics need not be restricted to wave dynamics, and we consider systems described by diffusive dynamics. We study the heat transfer in two countermoving media and show that this system exhibits anti–parity-time symmetry. The spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a phase transition from motionless temperature profiles, despite the mechanical motion of the background, to moving temperature profiles. Our results extend the concepts of parity-time symmetry beyond wave physics and may offer opportunities to manipulate heat and mass transport.</p>

Spindle asymmetry drives non-Mendelian chromosome segregation
<p>Genetic elements compete for transmission through meiosis, when haploid gametes are created from a diploid parent. Selfish elements can enhance their transmission through a process known as meiotic drive. In female meiosis, selfish elements drive by preferentially attaching to the egg side of the spindle. This implies some asymmetry between the two sides of the spindle, but the molecular mechanisms underlying spindle asymmetry are unknown. Here we found that CDC42 signaling from the cell cortex regulated microtubule tyrosination to induce spindle asymmetry and that non-Mendelian segregation depended on this asymmetry. Cortical CDC42 depends on polarization directed by chromosomes, which are positioned near the cortex to allow the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">symmetri</span></strong></span></strong>c cell division. Thus, selfish meiotic drivers exploit the asymmetry inherent in female meiosis to bias their transmission.</p>

Structure of the complete elongation complex of RNA polymerase II with basal factors
<p>In the early stage of transcription, eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) exchanges initiation factors with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation factors to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation complex for processive transcription. Here we report the structure of the Pol II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation complex bound with the basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation factors Spt4/5, Elf1, and TFIIS. Spt4/5 (the Spt4/Spt5 complex) and Elf1 modify a wide area of the Pol II surface. Elf1 bridges the Pol II central cleft, completing a “DNA entry tunnel” for downstream DNA. Spt4 and the Spt5 NGN and KOW1 domains encircle the upstream DNA, constituting a “DNA exit tunnel.” The Spt5 KOW4 and KOW5 domains augment the “RNA exit tunnel,” directing the exiting nascent RNA. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation complex establishes a completely different transcription and regulation platform from that of the initiation complexes.</p>

ATP as a biological hydrotrope
<p>Hydrotropes are small molecules that solubilize hydrophobic molecules in aqueous solutions. Typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic molecules and differ from classical surfactants in that they have low cooperativity of aggregation and work at molar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Here, we show that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has properties of a biological hydrotrope. It can both prevent the formation of and dissolve previously formed protein aggregates. This chemical property is manifested at physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations between 5 and 10 millimolar. Therefore, in addition to being an energy source for biological reactions, for which micromolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations are sufficient, we propose that millimolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ATP may act to keep proteins soluble. This may in part explain why ATP is maintained in such high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in cells.</p>

Systems-level analysis of mechanisms regulating yeast metabolic flux
<p>Cellular metabolic fluxes are determined by enzyme activities and metabolite abundances. Biochemical approaches reveal the impact of specific substrates or regulators on enzyme kinetics but do not capture the extent to which metabolite and enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations vary across physiological states and, therefore, how cellular reactions are regulated. We measured enzyme and metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations and metabolic fluxes across 25 steady-state yeast cultures. We then assessed the extent to which flux can be explained by a Michaelis-Menten relationship between enzyme, substrate, product, and potential regulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. This revealed three previously unrecognized instances of cross-pathway regulation, which we biochemically verified. One of these involved inhibition of pyruvate kinase by citrate, which accumulated and thereby curtailed glycolytic outflow in nitrogen-limited yeast. Overall, substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations were the strongest driver of the net rates of cellular metabolic reactions, with metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations collectively having more than double the physiological impact of enzymes.</p>

OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-Type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution
<p>Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Cu trafficking and distribution to different organs in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we report the function and role of Antioxidant Protein1 (OsATX1), a Cu chaperone in rice. Knocking out <i>OsATX1</i> resulted in increased Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in roots, whereas <i>OsATX1</i> overexpression reduced root Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations but increased Cu accumulation in the shoots. At the reproductive stage, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of Cu in developing tissues, including panicles, upper nodes and internodes, younger leaf blades, and leaf sheaths of the main tiller, were increased significantly in <i>OsATX1</i>-overexpressing plants and decreased in <i>osatx1</i> mutants compared with the wild type. The <i>osatx1</i> mutants also showed a higher Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation in older leaves. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsATX1 interacts with the rice heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases HMA4, HMA5, HMA6, and HMA9. These results suggest that OsATX1 may function to deliver Cu to heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases for Cu trafficking and distribution in order to maintain Cu homeostasis in different rice tissues. In addition, heterologous expression of <i>OsATX1</i> in the yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) cadmium-sensitive mutant Δ<i>ycf1</i> increased the tolerance to Cu and cadmium by decreasing their respective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the transformed yeast cells. Taken together, our results indicate that OsATX1 plays an important role in facilitating root-to-shoot Cu translocation and the redistribution of Cu from old leaves to developing tissues and seeds in rice.</p>

Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four petals characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e petal number distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> petal number varies in response to seasonal changes in environment. To address this question, we assessed whether petal number responds to a suite of environmental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that petal number showed seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering plants developed more petals than those flowering in summer. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including cool ambient temperature, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. Cool temperature caused the strongest increase in petal number and lengthened the time interval over which floral meristems matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that floral buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of floral meristem formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more space available for petal initiation. In summary, the growth and maturation of floral buds is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i> and responds to seasonal changes in ambient temperature.</p>

Sucrose Transporter Localization and Function in Phloem Unloading in Developing Stems
<p>How sucrose transporters (SUTs) regulate phloem unloading in monocot stems is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. To this end, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> SUTs SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 were characterized by determining their transport properties heterologously expressed in yeast or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and their in planta cellular and subcellular localization. The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong selectivity for Suc and high Suc affinities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at pH 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc affinity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and pH. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc affinity was independent of membrane potential and pH but supported high transport rates at neutral pH. Suc transport by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using yeast or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to sieve elements, while for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ating and recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ated internodes, SUTs also were detected in storage parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc unloading from de-energized protophloem sieve elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. Storage parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ating and recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to release Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic unloading pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into metaphloem sieve elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic unloading by bulk flow.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion onto phenotypic trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene effects with patterns of phenotypic trait co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from mutational pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion to phenotypic co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP map of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP map match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main effects of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.</p>

Day-to-Day Blood Pressure Variability and Risk of Dementia in a General Japanese Elderly Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Several observational studies have reported that higher visit-to-visit blood pressure variability is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. However, no studies have investigated the association of day-to-day blood pressure variability assessed by home blood pressure measurement with the development of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 1674 community-dwelling Japanese elderly without dementia, ≥60 years of age, were followed up for 5 years (2007–2012). Home blood pressure was measured 3 times every morning for a median of 28 days. Day-to-day systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure variabilities, calculated as coefficients of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion (CoV) of home SBP and diastolic blood pressure, were categorized into quartiles. The hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of the CoV levels of home blood pressure on the development of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia (VaD), and Alzheimer disease (AD) were computed with a Cox proportional hazards model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the follow-up, 194 subjects developed all-cause dementia; of these, 47 had VaD and 134 had AD. The age- and sex-adjusted incidences of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD increased significantly with increasing CoV levels of home SBP (all <i>P</i> for trend <0.05). These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including home SBP. Compared with subjects in the first quartile of CoV levels of home SBP, the risks of the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD were significantly higher in those in the fourth quartile (hazard ratio=2.27, 95% confidence interval=1.45–3.55, <i>P</i><0.001 for all-cause dementia; hazard ratio=2.79, 95% confidence interval=1.04–7.51, <i>P</i>=0.03 for VaD; hazard ratio=2.22, 95% confidence interval=1.31–3.75, <i>P</i><0.001 for AD). Similar associations were observed for CoV levels of home diastolic blood pressure. Meanwhile, home SBP levels were significantly associated with the risk of VaD but not with the risks of all-cause dementia and AD. There was no interaction between home SBP levels and CoV levels of home SBP on the risk of each subtype of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that increased day-to-day blood pressure variability is, independently of average home blood pressure, a significant risk factor for the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD in the general elderly Japanese population.</p></sec>

Colchicine-induced degeneration of the micronucleus during conjugation in <i>Tetrahymena</i>
<p>One of the most dramatic examples of nuclear morphogenesis occurs during conjugation in <i>Tetrahymena</i> when the micronucleus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ates to a size longer than the cell itself. After contraction to a spherical shape, the nucleus moves directly to chromosome separation in the first meiotic division. Here we investigate the consequences of interrupting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation process. Colchicine, a microtubule inhibitor, caused retraction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ated structures. With time, cells began to lose their micronuclei, and by five hours more than half of the paired cells had at least one cell missing a micronucleus. After reversing the colchicine block, existing micronuclei did not undergo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation again, nor did meiosis occur. These observations indicate that micronuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation is critical to subsequent meiotic division. Further, nuclear elimination occurs, which could be due to meiotic failure or possibly a problem downstream from meiosis. An analysis of the process of colchicine-induced micronuclear degeneration indicated that it was regulated by a caspase-dependent mechanism, characteristic of apoptosis, and then resorbed by a lysosome-dependent autophagic mechanism. Amicronucleate cells failed to grow when returned to nutrient medium, likely because of a lesion in the post-conjugation reconstruction of a functioning oral apparatus. The ease by which a large number of nuclei are induced to “self-destruct” may make this system useful in investigating the link between colchicine treatment and nuclear death in <i>Tetrahymena</i>, and in investigating how nuclear death could be regulated in living cells more generally. Finally, we note that this phenomenon might relate to the evolution of amicronucleate species of <i>Tetrahymena</i>.</p>

3D Imaging of Tapetal Mitochondria Suggests the Importance of Mitochondrial Fission in Pollen Growth
<p>Mitochondrial fission occurs frequently in plant cells, but its biological significance is poorly understood because mutants specifically impaired in mitochondrial fission do not show obvious defects in vegetative growth. Here, we revealed that the production of viable pollen was reduced in mutants lacking one of the three main proteins involved in mitochondrial fission in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3A (DRP3A)/Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-LIKE PROTEIN2A, DRP3B, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ATED MITOCHONDRIA1 (ELM1). In <i>drp3b</i> and <i>elm1</i>, young microspores contained an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al number of nuclei, and mature pollen had aberrant accumulation of lipids in their coat and an irregular pollen outer wall. Because the formation of the pollen wall and coat is mainly associated with tapetal function, we used 3D imaging to quantify geometric and textural features of cells and mitochondria in the tapetum at different stages, using isolated single tapetal cells in which the in vivo morphology and volume of cells and mitochondria were preserved. Tapetal cells and their mitochondria changed in the volume and morphology at different developmental stages. Defective mitochondrial fission in the <i>elm1</i> and <i>drp3b</i> mutants caused changes in mitochondrial status, including mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al mitochondrial ultrastructure, a decrease in cross-sectional area, and a slight alteration of mitochondrial distribution, as well as a large reduction in mitochondrial density. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial fission is required for proper mitochondrial status in the tapetum and possibly in pollen as well and therefore plays an important role for the production of viable pollen.</p>

EPFL Signals in the Boundary Region of the SAM Restrict Its Size and Promote Leaf Initiation
<p>The shoot apical meristem (SAM) enables the formation of new organs throughout the life of a plant. ERECTA family (ERf) receptors restrict SAM size and promote initiation of leaves while simultaneously supporting establishment of correct phyllotaxy. In the epidermis and during organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation ERf activity is regulated by a family of Epidermal Patterning Factor-Like (EPFL) secreted Cys-rich small proteins. Here we show that ERfs play a critical role in communication between the SAM leaf boundary and the central zone in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Ectopic expression of <i>ERECTA</i> in the central zone using the <i>CLAVATA3</i> promoter is sufficient to restrict meristem size and promote leaf initiation. Genetic analysis demonstrated that four putative ligands: EPFL1, EPFL2, EPFL4, and EPFL6 function redundantly in the SAM. These genes are expressed at the SAM-leaf boundary and in the peripheral zone. Previously EPFL4 and EPFL6 have been linked with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation of aboveground organs. Here we demonstrate that EPFL1 and EPFL2 promote organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation as well. In addition, we show that expression of <i>ERECTA</i> in the central zone of the SAM has a strong impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation of internodes and pedicels and growth of leaves. These results suggest that ERfs can stimulate organ growth cell nonautonomously.</p>

A New Phenotyping Pipeline Reveals Three Types of Lateral Roots and a Random Branching Pattern in Two Cereals
<p>Recent progress in root phenotyping has focused mainly on increasing throughput for genetic studies, while identifying root developmental patterns has been comparatively underexplored. We introduce a new phenotyping pipeline for producing high-quality spatiotemporal root system development data and identifying developmental patterns within these data. The SmartRoot image-analysis system and temporal and spatial statistical models were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Semi-Markov switching linear models were used to cluster lateral roots based on their growth rate profiles. These models revealed three types of lateral roots with similar characteristics in both species. The first type corresponds to fast and accelerating roots, the second to rapidly arrested roots, and the third to an intermediate type where roots cease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation after a few days. These types of lateral roots were retrieved in different proportions in a maize mutant affected in auxin signaling, while the first most vigorous type was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover, the classification of growth rate profiles was mirrored by a ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential dependencies in the succession of lateral root types along the primary root were then analyzed using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e-order Markov chains. The lateral root type was not influenced by the shootward neighbor root type or by the distance from this root. This random branching pattern of primary roots was remarkably conserved, despite the high variability of root systems in both species. Our phenotyping pipeline opens the door to exploring the genetic variability of lateral root developmental patterns.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in photosynthetic parameters measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield potential.</p>

A Magnesium Transporter OsMGT1 Plays a Critical Role in Salt Tolerance in Rice
<p>Salt stress is one of the major factors limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production globally. Although several transporters involved in salt tolerance have been identified in rice, the mechanisms regulating their transport activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg transporter OsMGT1 is required for salt tolerance probably by regulating transport activity of OsHKT1;5, a key transporter for the removal of Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem sap at the root mature zone. Knockout of <i>OsMGT1</i> did not affect total Na uptake, but increased Na <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation in the shoots and xylem sap, resulting in a significant increase in salt sensitivity at low external Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation (20–200 μ<sc>m</sc>). However, such differences were abolished at a higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation (2 m<sc>m</sc>), although the total Na uptake was not altered. <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in both the roots and shoots, but only that in the roots was moderately up-regulated by salt stress. Spatial expression analysis revealed that <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in all root cells of the root tips but was highly expressed in the pericycle of root mature zone. <i>OsMGT1</i> was also expressed in the phloem region of basal node, leaf blade, and sheath. When expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, the transport activity of OsHKT1;5 was enhanced by elevating external Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Furthermore, knockout of <i>OsHKT1;5</i> in <i>osmgt1</i> mutant background did not further increase its salt sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that Mg<sup>2+</sup> transported by OsMGT1 in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots.</p>

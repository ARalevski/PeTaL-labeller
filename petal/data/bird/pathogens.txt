Lectins modulate the microbiota of social amoebae
<p>The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> maintains a microbiome during multicellular development; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> are carried in migrating slugs and as endosymbionts within amoebae and spores. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l carriage and endosymbiosis are induced by the secreted lectin discoidin I that binds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, protects them from extracellular killing, and alters their retention within amoebae. This altered handling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> also occurs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> coated by plant lectins and leads to DNA transfer from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> to amoebae. Thus, lectins alter the cellular response of <i>D. discoideum</i> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> to establish the amoebae’s microbiome. Mammalian cells can also maintain intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> when presented with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> coated with lectins, so heterologous lectins may induce endosymbiosis in animals. Our results suggest that endogenous or environmental lectins may influence microbiome homeostasis across eukaryotic phylogeny.</p>

Control of potassium homeostasis is an essential function of the second messenger cyclic di-AMP in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>
<p>The second messenger cyclic di–adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is essential in the Gram-positive model organism <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and in related pathogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>. It controls the activity of the conserved <i>ydaO</i> riboswitch and of several proteins involved in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) uptake. We found that the YdaO protein was conserved among several different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> and provide evidence that YdaO functions as a K<sup>+</sup> transporter. Thus, we renamed the gene and protein KimA (K<sup>+</sup> importer A). Reporter activity assays indicated that expression beyond the c-di-AMP–responsive riboswitch of the <i>kimA</i> upstream regulatory region occurred only in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> grown in medium containing low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicated that c-di-AMP accumulated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> grown in the presence of high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations but not in low concentrations. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l strain lacking all genes encoding c-di-AMP–synthesizing enzymes was viable when grown in medium containing low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, but not at higher K<sup>+</sup> concentrations unless it acquired suppressor mutations in the gene encoding the cation exporter NhaK. Thus, our results indicated that the control of potassium homeostasis is an essential function of c-di-AMP.</p>

Gut microbiome–mediated bile acid metabolism regulates liver cancer via NKT cells
<p>Primary liver tumors and liver metastasis currently represent the leading cause of cancer-related death. Commensal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> are important regulators of antitumor immunity, and although the liver is exposed to gut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, their role in antitumor surveillance of liver tumors is poorly understood. We found that altering commensal gut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> in mice induced a liver-selective antitumor effect, with an increase of hepatic CXCR6<sup>+</sup> natural killer T (NKT) cells and heightened interferon-γ production upon antigen stimulation. In vivo functional studies showed that NKT cells mediated liver-selective tumor inhibition. NKT cell accumulation was regulated by CXCL16 expression of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which was controlled by gut microbiome-mediated primary-to-secondary bile acid conversion. Our study suggests a link between gut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>–controlled bile acid metabolism and liver antitumor immunosurveillance.</p>

Vaginal bacteria modify HIV tenofovir microbicide efficacy in African women
<p>Antiretroviral-based strategies for HIV prevention have shown inconsistent results in women. We investigated whether vaginal microbiota modulated tenofovir gel microbicide efficacy in the CAPRISA (Centre for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa) 004 trial. Two major vaginal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l community types—one dominated by <i>Lactobacillus</i> (59.2%) and the other where <i>Gardnerella vaginalis</i> predominated with other anaerobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> (40.8%)—were identified in 688 women profiled. Tenofovir reduced HIV incidence by 61% (<i>P</i> = 0.013) in <i>Lactobacillus-</i>dominant women but only 18% (<i>P</i> = 0.644) in women with non-<i>Lactobacillus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, a threefold difference in efficacy. Detectible mucosal tenofovir was lower in non-<i>Lactobacillus</i> women, negatively correlating with <i>G. vaginalis</i> and other anaerobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, which depleted tenofovir by metabolism more rapidly than target cells convert to pharmacologically active drug.

A secreted bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolase enhances tolerance to enteric pathogens

An intramembrane sensory circuit monitors sortase A–mediated processing of streptococcal adhesins
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l adhesins mediate adhesion to substrates and biofilm formation. Adhesins of the LPXTG family are posttranslationally processed by the cell membrane–localized peptidase sortase A, which cleaves the LPXTG motif. This generates a short C-terminal peptide (C-pep) that remains in the cell membrane, whereas the mature adhesin is incorporated into the cell wall. Genes encoding adhesins of the oral bacterium <i>Streptococcus gordonii</i> were differentially expressed depending on whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> were isolated from saliva or dental plaque and appeared to be coordinately regulated. Deletion of <i>sspA</i> and <i>sspB (sspAB)</i>, both of which encode LPXTG-containing adhesins, unexpectedly enhanced adhesion and biofilm formation. C-peps produced from a model LPXTG-containing adhesin localized to the cell membrane and bound to and inhibited the intramembrane sensor histidine kinase SGO_1180, thus preventing activation of the cognate response regulator SGO_1181. The absence of SspAB C-peps induced the expression of the <i>scaCBA</i> operon encoding the lipoprotein adhesin ScaA, which was sufficient to preserve and even enhance biofilm formation. This C-pep–driven regulatory circuit also exists in pathogenic streptococci and is likely conserved among Gram-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>. This quality control mechanism ensures that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> can form biofilms under diverse environmental conditions and may play a role in optimizing adhesion and biofilm formation.</p>

Endocytosis of commensal antigens by intestinal epithelial cells regulates mucosal T cell homeostasis
<p>Commensal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> influence host physiology, without invading host tissues. We show that proteins from segmented filamentous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> (SFB) are transferred into intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) through adhesion-directed endocytosis that is distinct from the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of invasive pathogens. This process transfers microbial cell wall–associated proteins, including an antigen that stimulates mucosal T helper 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) cell differentiation, into the cytosol of IECs in a cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42)–dependent manner. Removal of CDC42 activity in vivo led to disruption of endocytosis induced by SFB and decreased epithelial antigen acquisition, with consequent loss of mucosal T<sub>H</sub>17 cells. Our findings demonstrate direct communication between a resident gut microbe and the host and show that under physiological conditions, IECs acquire antigens from commensal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> for generation of T cell responses to the resident microbiota.</p>

Potential role of intratumor bacteria in mediating tumor resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine

Metabolism was dependent on the expression of a long isoform of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDD<sub>L</sub>), seen primarily in Gammaproteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>.

Why tolerance invites resistance

A bacterial global regulator forms a prion

Here we found that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l protein, transcription terminator Rho of <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> (<i>Cb</i>-Rho), could form a prion. We identified a candidate prion-forming domain (cPrD) in <i>Cb</i>-Rho and showed that it conferred amyloidogenicity on <i>Cb</i>-Rho and could functionally replace the PrD of a yeast prion-forming protein. Furthermore, its cPrD enabled <i>Cb</i>-Rho to access alternative conformations in <i>Escherichia coli</i>—a soluble form that terminated transcription efficiently and an aggregated, self-propagating prion form that was functionally compromised. The prion form caused genome-wide changes in the transcriptome. Thus, <i>Cb</i>-Rho functions as a protein-based element of inheritance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, suggesting that the emergence of prions predates the evolutionary split between eukaryotes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>.</p>

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p>Lipid A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>. Lipid A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the phosphates of lipid A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different lipid A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the lipid A phosphates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory protein PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional phosphate group to lipid A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modification of the lipid A phosphates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modification of lipid A phosphates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in lipid A negative charge. Our findings demonstrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> tailor their cell surface to different stresses, such as those faced inside phagocytes.</p>

Integrated in vivo multiomics analysis identifies p21-activated kinase signaling as a driver of colitis
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that has limited treatment options. To gain insight into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of chronic colonic inflammation (colitis), we performed a multiomics analysis that integrated RNA microarray, total protein mass spectrometry (MS), and phosphoprotein MS measurements from a mouse model of the disease. Because we collected all three types of data from individual samples, we tracked information flow from RNA to protein to phosphoprotein and identified signaling molecules that were coordinately or discordantly regulated and pathways that had complex regulation in vivo. For example, the genes encoding acute-phase proteins were expressed in the liver, but the proteins were detected by MS in the colon during inflammation. We also ascertained the types of data that best described particular facets of chronic inflammation. Using gene set enrichment analysis and trans-omics coexpression network analysis, we found that each data set provided a distinct viewpoint on the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of colitis. Combining human transcriptomic data with the mouse multiomics data implicated increased p21-activated kinase (Pak) signaling as a driver of colitis. Chemical inhibition of Pak1 and Pak2 with FRAX597 suppressed active colitis in mice. These studies provide translational insights into the mechanisms contributing to colitis and identify Pak as a potential therapeutic target in IBD.</p>

TCR-stimulated changes in cell surface CD46 expression generate type 1 regulatory T cells
<p>A lack of regulatory T cell function is a critical factor in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Ligation of the complement regulatory protein CD46 facilitates the differentiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) effector cells into interleukin-10 (IL-10)–secreting type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells), and this pathway is defective in MS patients. Cleavage of the ectodomain of CD46, which contains three N-glycosylation sites and multiple O-glycosylation sites, enables CD46 to activate T cells. We found that stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR)–CD3 complex was associated with a reduction in the apparent molecular mass of CD46 in a manner that depended on O-glycosylation. CD3-stimulated changes in CD46 O-glycosylation status reduced CD46 processing and subsequent T cell signaling. During T cell activation, CD46 was recruited to the immune synapse in a manner that required its serine-, threonine-, and proline-rich (STP) region, which is rich in O-glycosylation sites. Recruitment of CD46 to the immune synapse switched T cells from producing the inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to producing IL-10. Furthermore, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from MS patients did not exhibit a CD3-stimulated reduction in the mass of CD46 and thus showed increased amounts of cell surface CD46. Together, these data suggest a possible mechanism underlying the regulatory function of CD46 on T cells. Our findings may explain why this pathway is defective in patients with MS and provide insights into MS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s that could help to design future immunotherapies.</p>

TALK-1 channels control β cell endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis

ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is determined by ion movements across the ER membrane, including K<sup>+</sup> flux through K<sup>+</sup> channels. We demonstrated that K<sup>+</sup> flux through ER-localized TALK-1 channels facilitated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER in mouse and human β cells. We found that β cells from mice lacking TALK-1 exhibited reduced basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, suggesting reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak. These changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis were presumably due to TALK-1–mediated ER K<sup>+</sup> flux, because we recorded K<sup>+</sup> currents mediated by functional TALK-1 channels on the nuclear membrane, which is continuous with the ER. Moreover, overexpression of K<sup>+</sup>-impermeable TALK-1 channels in HEK293 cells did not reduce ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. Reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in β cells is associated with ER stress and islet dysfunction in diabetes, and islets from TALK-1–deficient mice fed a high-fat diet showed reduced signs of ER stress, suggesting that TALK-1 activity exacerbated ER stress.

<p>Intestinal colonization by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> of oral origin has been correlated with several negative health outcomes, including inflammatory bowel disease. However, a causal role of oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> ectopically colonizing the intestine remains unclear. Using gnotobiotic techniques, we show that strains of <i>Klebsiella</i> spp. isolated from the salivary microbiota are strong inducers of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) cells when they colonize in the gut. These <i>Klebsiella</i> strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics, tend to colonize when the intestinal microbiota is dysbiotic, and elicit a severe gut inflammation in the context of a genetically susceptible host. Our findings suggest that the oral cavity may serve as a reservoir for potential intestinal pathobionts that can exacerbate intestinal disease.</p>

Driving mosquito refractoriness to <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> with engineered symbiotic bacteria
<p>The huge burden of malaria in developing countries urgently demands the development of novel approaches to fight this deadly disease. Although engineered symbiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> have been shown to render mosquitoes resistant to the parasite, the challenge remains to effectively introduce such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> into mosquito populations. We describe a <i>Serratia</i> bacterium strain (AS1) isolated from <i>Anopheles</i> ovaries that stably colonizes the mosquito midgut, female ovaries, and male accessory glands and spreads rapidly throughout mosquito populations. <i>Serratia</i> AS1 was genetically engineered for secretion of anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> effector proteins, and the recombinant strains inhibit development of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in mosquitoes.</p>

Regulation of sugar transporter activity for antibacterial defense in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Microbial pathogens strategically acquire metabolites from their hosts during infection. Here we show that the host can intervene to prevent such metabolite loss to pathogens. Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of sugar transport protein 13 (STP13) is required for anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l defense in the plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. STP13 physically associates with the flagellin receptor flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2) and its co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1–associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1). BAK1 phosphorylates STP13 at threonine 485, which enhances its monosaccharide uptake activity to compete with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> for extracellular sugars. Limiting the availability of extracellular sugar deprives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> of an energy source and restricts virulence factor delivery. Our results reveal that control of sugar uptake, managed by regulation of a host sugar transporter, is a defense strategy deployed against microbial infection. Competition for sugar thus shapes host-pathogen interactions.</p>

Phosphorylation of Arabidopsis MAP Kinase Phosphatase 1 (MKP1) Is Required for PAMP Responses and Resistance against Bacteria
<p>Plants perceive potential pathogens via the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized pattern recognition receptors, which initiates a series of intracellular responses that ultimately limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l growth. PAMP responses include changes in intracellular protein phosphorylation, including the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), such as Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MKP1, are important negative regulators of MAPKs and play a crucial role in controlling the intensity and duration of MAPK activation during innate immune signaling. As such, the <i>mkp1</i> mutant lacking MKP1 displays enhanced PAMP responses and resistance against the virulent bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. Previous in vitro studies showed that MKP1 can be phosphorylated and activated by MPK6, suggesting that phosphorylation may be an important mechanism for regulating MKP1. We found that MKP1 was phosphorylated during PAMP elicitation and that phosphorylation stabilized the protein, resulting in protein accumulation after elicitation. MKP1 also can be stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that MKP1 is constitutively degraded through the proteasome in the resting state. In addition, we investigated the role of MKP1 posttranslational regulation in plant defense by testing whether phenotypes of the <i>mkp1</i> Arabidopsis mutant could be complemented by expressing phosphorylation site mutations of MKP1. The phosphorylation of MKP1 was found to be required for some, but not all, of MKP1’s functions in PAMP responses and defense against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>. Together, our results provide insight into the roles of phosphorylation in the regulation of MKP1 during PAMP signaling and resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>.</p>

A novel mouse model of Warburg Micro syndrome reveals roles for RAB18 in eye development and organisation of the neuronal cytoskeleton
<p>Mutations in <i>RAB18</i> have been shown to cause the heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM). Individuals with WARBM present with a range of clinical symptoms, including ocular and neurological abnormalities. However, the underlying cellular and molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of the disorder remains unclear, largely owing to the lack of any robust animal models that phenocopy both the ocular and neurological features of the disease. We report here the generation and characterisation of a novel <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse model of WARBM. <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice are viable and fertile. They present with congenital nuclear cataracts and atonic pupils, recapitulating the characteristic ocular features that are associated with WARBM. Additionally, <i>Rab18</i>-mutant cells exhibit an increase in lipid droplet size following treatment with oleic acid. Lipid droplet abnormalities are a characteristic feature of cells taken from WARBM individuals, as well as cells taken from individuals with other neurodegenerative conditions. Neurological dysfunction is also apparent in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice, including progressive weakness of the hind limbs. We show that the neurological defects are, most likely, not caused by gross perturbations in synaptic vesicle recycling in the central or peripheral nervous system. Rather, loss of <i>Rab18</i> is associated with widespread disruption of the neuronal cytoskeleton, including abnormal accumulations of neurofilament and microtubule proteins in synaptic terminals, and gross disorganisation of the cytoskeleton in peripheral nerves. Global proteomic profiling of peripheral nerves in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice reveals significant alterations in several core molecular pathways that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in neurons. The apparent similarities between the WARBM phenotype and the phenotype that we describe here indicate that the <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse provides an important platform for investigation of the disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s and therapeutic interventions.</p>

Osteoarticular tissue infection and development of skeletal pathology in murine brucellosis
<p>Brucellosis, a frequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l zoonosis, can produce debilitating chronic disease with involvement of multiple organs in human patients. Whereas acute brucellosis is well studied using the murine animal model, long-term complications of host-pathogen interaction remain largely elusive. Human brucellosis frequently results in persistent, chronic osteoarticular system involvement, with complications such as arthritis, spondylitis and sacroiliitis. Here, we focused on identifying infectious sites in the mouse that parallel <i>Brucella melitensis</i> foci observed in patients. <i>In vivo</i> imaging showed rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l dispersal to multiple sites of the murine axial skeleton. In agreement with these findings, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> in bones and limbs, and in the lower spine vertebrae of the axial skeleton where they were preferentially located in the bone marrow. Surprisingly, some animals developed arthritis in paws and spine after infection, but without obvious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> in these sites. The identification of <i>Brucella</i> in the bones of mice corroborates the findings in humans that these osteoarticular sites are important niches for the persistence of <i>Brucella</i> in the host, but the mechanisms that mediate pathological manifestations in these sites remain unclear. Future studies addressing the immune responses within osteoarticular tissue foci could elucidate important tissue injury mediators and <i>Brucella</i> survival strategies.</p>

Left Ventricular Structure and Function in Transthyretin-Related Versus Light-Chain Cardiac Amyloidosis
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Immunoglobulin amyloid light-chain (AL)-related cardiac amyloidosis (CA) has a worse prognosis than either wild-type (ATTRwt) or mutant (ATTRm) transthyretin (TTR) CA. Detailed echocardiographic studies have been performed in AL amyloidosis but not in TTR amyloidosis and might give insight into this difference. We assessed cardiac structure and function and outcome in a large population of patients with CA and compared findings in TTR and AL-related disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We analyzed 172 patients with CA (AL amyloidosis, n=80; ATTRm, n=36; ATTRwt, n=56) by standard echocardiography and 2-dimensional speckle-tracking imaging-derived left ventricular (LV) longitudinal (LS), radial, and circumferential strains. Despite a preserved LV ejection fraction (55±12%), LS was severely impaired in CA.

An Animal-Like Cryptochrome Controls the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Sexual Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are known as flavin-binding blue light receptors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, fungi, plants, and insects. The animal-like cryptochrome (aCRY) of the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> has extended our view on cryptochromes, because it responds also to other wavelengths of the visible spectrum, including red light. Here, we have investigated if aCRY is involved in the regulation of the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, which is controlled by blue and red light at the steps of gametogenesis along with its restoration and germination. We show that aCRY is differentially expressed not only during the life cycle but also within the cell as part of the soluble and/or membrane-associated protein fraction. Moreover, localization of aCRY within the algal cell body varies between vegetative cells and the different cell types of gametogenesis. aCRY is significantly (early day) or to a small extent (late night) enriched in the nucleus in vegetative cells. In pregametes, gametes and dark-inactivated gametes, aCRY is localized over the cell body. aCRY plays an important role in the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>: It controls the germination of the alga, under which the zygote undergoes meiosis, in a positive manner, similar to the regulation by the blue light receptors phototropin and plant cryptochrome (pCRY). However, aCRY acts in combination with pCRY as a negative regulator for mating ability as well as for mating maintenance, opposite to the function of phototropin in these processes.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During oxygenic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to oxygen, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

A Plant Cryptochrome Controls Key Features of the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Circadian Clock and Its Life Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-binding proteins that act as blue light receptors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, fungi, plants, and insects and are components of the circadian oscillator in mammals. Animal and plant cryptochromes are evolutionarily divergent, although the unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas</i> throughout) has both an animal-like cryptochrome and a plant cryptochrome (pCRY; formerly designated CPH1). Here, we show that the pCRY protein accumulates at night as part of a complex. Functional characterization of pCRY was performed based on an insertional mutant that expresses only 11% of the wild-type pCRY level. The <i>pcry</i> mutant is defective for central properties of the circadian clock. In the mutant, the period is lengthened significantly, ultimately resulting in arrhythmicity, while blue light-based phase shifts show large deviations from what is observed in wild-type cells. We also show that pCRY is involved in gametogenesis in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. pCRY is down-regulated in pregametes and gametes, and in the <i>pcry</i> mutant, there is altered transcript accumulation under blue light of the strictly light-dependent, gamete-specific gene <i>GAS28</i>. pCRY acts as a negative regulator for the induction of mating ability in the light and for the loss of mating ability in the dark. Moreover, pCRY is necessary for light-dependent germination, during which the zygote undergoes meiosis that gives rise to four vegetative cells. In sum, our data demonstrate that pCRY is a key blue light receptor in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> that is involved in both circadian timing and life cycle progression.</p>

MtLAX2, a Functional Homologue of the Arabidopsis Auxin Influx Transporter AUX1, Is Required for Nodule Organogenesis
<p>Most legume plants can form nodules, specialized lateral organs that form on roots, and house nitrogen-fixing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> collectively called rhizobia. The uptake of the phytohormone auxin into cells is known to be crucial for development of lateral roots. To test the role of auxin influx in nodulation we used the auxin influx inhibitors 1-naphthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA) and 2-NOA, which we found reduced nodulation of <i>Medicago truncatula.</i> This suggested the possible involvement of the AUX/LAX family of auxin influx transporters in nodulation. Gene expression studies identified <i>MtLAX2</i>, a paralogue of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AUX1</i>, as being induced at early stages of nodule development. <i>MtLAX2</i> is expressed in nodule primordia, the vasculature of developing nodules, and at the apex of mature nodules. The <i>MtLAX2</i> promoter contains several auxin response elements, and treatment with indole-acetic acid strongly induces <i>MtLAX2</i> expression in roots. <i>mtlax2</i> mutants displayed root phenotypes similar to Arabidopsis <i>aux1</i> mutants, including altered root gravitropism, fewer lateral roots, shorter root hairs, and auxin resistance. In addition, the activity of the synthetic DR5-GUS auxin reporter was strongly reduced in <i>mtlax2</i> roots. Following inoculation with rhizobia, <i>mtlax2</i> roots developed fewer nodules, had decreased DR5-GUS activity associated with infection sites, and had decreased expression of the early auxin responsive gene <i>ARF16a</i>. Our data indicate that MtLAX2 is a functional analog of Arabidopsis AUX1 and is required for the accumulation of auxin during nodule formation in tissues underlying sites of rhizobial infection.</p>

Abscisic Acid Induces Resistance against <i>Bamboo Mosaic Virus</i> through <i>Argonaute</i> <i>2</i> and <i>3</i>
<p>Plant resistance to pathogens is tuned by defense-related hormones. Of these, abscisic acid (ABA) is well documented to moderate resistance against fungi and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>. However, ABA’s contribution to resistance against viruses is pleiotropic. ABA affects callose deposition at plasmodesmata (therefore hindering the viral cell-to-cell movement), but here, we show that when callose synthase is down-regulated, ABA still induces resistance against infection with <i>Bamboo mosaic virus</i> (BaMV). By examining the potential connections between the ABA and RNA-silencing pathways in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we showed that ABA regulates the expression of almost the whole ARGONAUTE (AGO) gene family, of which some are required for plant resistance against BaMV. Our data show that BaMV infection and ABA treatment regulate the same set of AGOs, with positive effects on <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i>, no effect on <i>AGO7</i>, and negative effects on <i>AGO4</i> and <i>AGO10</i>. The BaMV-mediated regulation of <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i> is ABA dependent, because the accumulation of these <i>AGOs</i> in BaMV-infected ABA mutants did not reach the levels observed in infected wild-type plants. In addition, the <i>AGO1</i>-<i>miR168a</i> complex is dispensable for BaMV resistance, while <i>AGO2</i> and <i>AGO3</i> were important for ABA-mediated resistance. While most <i>ago</i> mutants showed increased susceptibility to BaMV infection (except <i>ago10</i>), <i>ago1-27</i> showed reduced BaMV titers, which was attributed to the up-regulated levels of <i>AGO2</i>, <i>AGO3</i>, and <i>AGO4</i>. We have established that ABA regulates the expression of several members of the AGO family, and this regulation partially contributes to ABA-mediated resistance against BaMV. These findings reveal another role for ABA in plants.</p>

The Arabidopsis Mitochondrial Protease FtSH4 Is Involved in Leaf Senescence via Regulation of WRKY-Dependent Salicylic Acid Accumulation and Signaling
<p>Mitochondria and autophagy play important roles in the networks that regulate plant leaf senescence and cell death. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between mitochondrial signaling and autophagy are currently not well understood. This study characterized the function of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mitochondrial AAA-protease gene <i>FtSH4</i> in regulating autophagy and senescence, finding that FtSH4 mediates WRKY-dependent salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and signaling. Knockout of <i>FtSH4</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant resulted in severe leaf senescence, cell death, and high autophagy levels. The level of SA increased dramatically in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant. Expression of <i>nahG</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant led to decreased SA levels and suppressed the leaf senescence and cell death phenotypes. The transcript levels of several SA synthesis and signaling genes, including <i>SALICYLIC ACID</i> <i>INDUCTION DEFICIENT2</i> (<i>SID2</i>), <i>NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1</i> (<i>NDR1</i>), and <i>NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEINS1</i> (<i>NPR1</i>), increased significantly in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants compared with the wild type. Loss of function of <i>SID2</i>, <i>NDR1</i>, or <i>NPR1</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant reversed the <i>ftsh4-4</i> senescence and autophagy phenotypes. Furthermore, <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants had elevated levels of transcripts of several <i>WRKY</i> genes, including <i>WRKY40</i>, <i>WRKY46</i>, <i>WRKY51</i>, <i>WRKY60</i>, <i>WRKY63</i>, and <i>WRKY75</i>; all of these WRKY proteins can bind to the promoter of <i>SID2</i>. Loss of function of <i>WRKY75</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants decreased the levels of SA and reversed the senescence phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that the mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease FtSH4 may regulate the expression of <i>WRKY</i> genes by modifying the level of reactive oxygen species and the WRKY transcription factors that control SA synthesis and signaling in autophagy and senescence.</p>

SDH6 and SDH7 Contribute to Anchoring Succinate Dehydrogenase to the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The succinate dehydrogenase complex (complex II) is a highly conserved protein complex composed of the SDH1 to SDH4 subunits in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> and in the mitochondria of animals and fungi. The reason for the occurrence of up to four additional subunits in complex II of plants, termed SDH5 to SDH8, so far is a mystery. Here, we present a biochemical approach to investigate the internal subunit arrangement of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) complex II. Using low-concentration detergent treatments, the holo complex is dissected into subcomplexes that are analyzed by a three-dimensional gel electrophoresis system. Protein identifications by mass spectrometry revealed that the largest subcomplex (IIa) represents the succinate dehydrogenase domain composed of SDH1 and SDH2. Another subcomplex (IIb) is composed of the SDH3, SDH4, SDH6, and SDH7 subunits. All four proteins include transmembrane helices and together form the membrane anchor of complex II. Sequence analysis revealed that SDH3 and SDH4 lack helices conserved in other organisms. Using homology modeling and phylogenetic analyses, we present evidence that SDH6 and SDH7 substitute missing sequence stretches of SDH3 and SDH4 in plants. Together with SDH5, which is liberated upon dissection of complex II into subcomplexes, SDH6 and SDH7 also add some hydrophilic mass to plant complex II, which possibly inserts further functions into this smallest protein complex of the oxidative phosphorylation system (which is not so small in plants).</p>

An Ethylene-Induced Regulatory Module Delays Flower Senescence by Regulating Cytokinin Content
<p>In many plant species, including rose (<i>Rosa hybrida</i>), flower senescence is promoted by the gaseous hormone ethylene and inhibited by the cytokinin (CTK) class of hormones. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these antagonistic effects are not well understood. In this study, we characterized the association between a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s-related PR-10 family gene from rose (<i>RhPR10.1</i>) and the hormonal regulation of flower senescence. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that <i>RhPR10.1</i> was expressed at high levels during senescence in different floral organs, including petal, sepal, receptacle, stamen, and pistil, and that expression was induced by ethylene treatment. Silencing of <i>RhPR10.1</i> expression in rose plants by virus-induced gene silencing accelerated flower senescence, which was accompanied by a higher ion leakage rate in the petals, as well as increased expression of the senescence marker gene <i>RhSAG12</i>. CTK content and the expression of three CTK signaling pathway genes were reduced in <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants, and the accelerated rate of petal senescence that was apparent in the <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants was restored to normal levels by CTK treatment. Finally, RhHB6, a homeodomain-Leu zipper I transcription factor, was observed to bind to the <i>RhPR10.1</i> promoter, and silencing of its expression also promoted flower senescence. Our results reveal an ethylene-induced RhHB6-RhPR10.1 regulatory module that functions as a brake of ethylene-promoted senescence through increasing the CTK content.</p>

Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) Cipk6 regulates immune and susceptible Programmed cell death in immunity transforming Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals into reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. To investigate SlCipk6-induced molecular mechanisms and identify putative substrates, a yeast two-hybrid approach was carried on and a protein was identified that contained a Universal stress protein (Usp) domain present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, protozoa and plants, which we named “SlRd2”. SlRd2 was an ATP-binding protein that formed homodimers in planta. SlCipk6 and SlRd2 interacted using coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves and the complex localized in the cytosol. SlCipk6 phosphorylated SlRd2 in vitro, thus defining, to our knowledge, a novel target for CIPKs. Heterologous SlRd2 overexpression in yeast conferred resistance to highly toxic LiCl, whereas SlRd2 expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> <i>UspA</i> mutant restored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l viability in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Finally, transient expression of SlCipk6 in transgenic <i>N</i>. <i>benthamiana</i> SlRd2 overexpressors resulted in reduced ROS accumulation as compared to wild-type plants. Taken together, our results establish that SlRd2, a tomato UspA, is, to our knowledge, a novel interactor and phosphorylation target of a member of the CIPK family, SlCipk6, and functionally regulates SlCipk6-mediated ROS generation.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Hydrocarbons Are Essential for Optimal Cell Size, Division, and Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>Cyano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> are intricately organized, incorporating an array of internal thylakoid membranes, the site of photosynthesis, into cells no larger than other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>. They also synthesize C15-C19 alkanes and alkenes, which results in substantial production of hydrocarbons in the environment. All sequenced cyano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> encode hydrocarbon biosynthesis pathways, suggesting an important, undefined physiological role for these compounds. Here, we demonstrate that hydrocarbon-deficient mutants of <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 and <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 exhibit significant phenotypic differences from wild type, including enlarged cell size, reduced growth, and increased division defects. Photosynthetic rates were similar between strains, although a minor reduction in energy transfer between the soluble light harvesting phycobilisome complex and membrane-bound photosystems was observed. Hydrocarbons were shown to accumulate in thylakoid and cytoplasmic membranes. Modeling of membranes suggests these compounds aggregate in the center of the lipid bilayer, potentially promoting membrane flexibility and facilitating curvature. In vivo measurements confirmed that <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 mutants lacking hydrocarbons exhibit reduced thylakoid membrane curvature compared to wild type. We propose that hydrocarbons may have a role in inducing the flexibility in membranes required for optimal cell division, size, and growth, and efficient association of soluble and membrane bound proteins. The recent identification of C15-C17 alkanes and alkenes in microalgal species suggests hydrocarbons may serve a similar function in a broad range of photosynthetic organisms.</p>

Connecting the Sequence-Space of Bacterial Signaling Proteins to Phenotypes Using Coevolutionary Landscapes
<p>Two-component signaling (TCS) is the primary means by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> sense and respond to the environment. TCS involves two partner proteins working in tandem, which interact to perform cellular functions whereas limiting interactions with non-partners (i.e., cross-talk). We construct a Potts model for TCS that can quantitatively predict how mutating amino acid identities affect the interaction between TCS partners and non-partners. The parameters of this model are inferred directly from protein sequence data. This approach drastically reduces the computational complexity of exploring the sequence-space of TCS proteins. As a stringent test, we compare its predictions to a recent comprehensive mutational study, which characterized the functionality of 20<sup>4</sup> mutational variants of the PhoQ kinase in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We find that our best predictions accurately reproduce the amino acid combinations found in experiment, which enable functional signaling with its partner PhoP. These predictions demonstrate the evolutionary pressure to preserve the interaction between TCS partners as well as prevent unwanted cross-talk. Further, we calculate the mutational change in the binding affinity between PhoQ and PhoP, providing an estimate to the amount of destabilization needed to disrupt TCS.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Unique function of a chemosensory protein in the proboscis of two <i>Helicoverpa</i> species
<p>Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are soluble proteins found only in arthropods. Some of them fill the lumen of chemosensilla and are believed to play a role similar to that of odorant-binding proteins in the detection of semiochemicals. Other members of the CSP family have been reported to perform different functions, from delivery of pheromones to development. This report is focused on a member (CSP4) of the family that is highly and almost exclusively present in the proboscis of two sibling noctuid species, <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> and <i>H. assulta</i>. We expressed the protein in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> and measured binding to terpenoids and related compounds. Using specific antibodies, we found that when the moths suck on a sugar solution, CSP4 is partly extruded from the proboscis. A solution of protein can also fill a hydrophobic tube of same length and diameter as the proboscis by capillary action. On this basis, we suggest that CSP4 acts as a wetting agent to reduce the surface tension of aqueous solutions and consequently the pressure involved in sucking.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D materials at the nanoscale with single-spin microscopy
<p>The discovery of ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals has generated widespread interest. Making further progress in this area requires quantitative knowledge of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic properties of vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s at the nanoscale. We used scanning single-spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometry based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers to image the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization, localized defects, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic domains of atomically thin crystals of the vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong> chromium(III) iodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>). We determined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization of CrI<sub>3</sub> monolayers to be ≈16 Bohr <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ons per square nanometer, with comparable values in samples with odd numbers of layers; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization vanishes when the number of layers is even. We also found that structural modifications can induce switching between ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic and antiferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic interlayer ordering. These results demonstrate the benefit of using single-spin scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometry to study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ism of 2D vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s.</p>

Saturn’s magnetic field revealed by the Cassini Grand Finale
<p>During 2017, the Cassini fluxgate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometer made in situ measurements of Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field at distances ~2550 ± 1290 kilometers above the 1-bar surface during 22 highly inclined Grand Finale orbits. These observations refine the extreme axisymmetry of Saturn’s internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field and show displacement of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic equator northward from the planet’s physical equator. Persistent small-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic structures, corresponding to high-degree (>3) axisymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic moments, were observed. This suggests secondary shallow dynamo action in the semiconducting region of Saturn’s interior. Some high-degree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic moments could arise from strong high-latitude concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic flux within the planet’s deep dynamo. A strong field-aligned current (FAC) system is located between Saturn and the inner edge of its D-ring, with strength comparable to the high-latitude auroral FACs.</p>

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic multilayer devices that exploit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>oresistance are the backbone of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic sensing and data storage technologies. Here, we report multiple-spin-filter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic tunnel junctions (sf-MTJs) based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which atomically thin chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) acts as a spin-filter tunnel barrier sandwiched between graphene contacts. We demonstrate tunneling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>oresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic circular dichroism measurements, we attribute these effects to the intrinsic layer-by-layer antiferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic ordering of the atomically thin CrI<sub>3</sub>. Our work reveals the possibility to push <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic information storage to the atomically thin limit and highlights CrI<sub>3</sub> as a superlative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic tunnel barrier for vdW heterostructure spintronic devices.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D van der Waals crystalline insulators via electron tunneling
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulators are a key resource for next-generation spintronic and topological devices. The family of layered metal halides promises varied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic states, including ultrathin insulating multiferroics, spin liquids, and ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s, but device-oriented characterization methods are needed to unlock their potential. Here, we report tunneling through the layered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulator CrI<sub>3</sub> as a function of temperature and applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. We electrically detect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic ground state and interlayer coupling and observe a field-induced meta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic transition. The meta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic transition results in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>oresistances of 95, 300, and 550% for bilayer, trilayer, and tetralayer CrI<sub>3</sub> barriers, respectively. We further measure inelastic tunneling spectra for our junctions, unveiling a rich spectrum consistent with collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic excitations (magnons) in CrI<sub>3</sub>.</p>

Quantized chiral edge conduction on domain walls of a magnetic topological insulator
<p>Electronic ordering in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic and dielectric materials forms domains with different signs of order parameters. The control of configuration and motion of the domain walls (DWs) enables nonvolatile responses against minute external fields. Here, we realize chiral edge states (CESs) on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic DWs of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic topological insulator. We design and fabricate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic domains in the quantum anomalous Hall state with the tip of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic force microscope and prove the existence of the chiral one-dimensional edge conduction along the prescribed DWs through transport measurements. The proof-of-concept devices based on reconfigurable CESs and Landauer-Buttiker formalism are realized for multiple-domain configurations with well-defined DW channels. Our results may lead to the realization of low-power-consumption spintronic devices.</p>

All-oxide–based synthetic antiferromagnets exhibiting layer-resolved magnetization reversal
<p>Synthesizing antiferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s with correlated oxides has been challenging, owing partly to the markedly degraded ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ism of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic layer at nanoscale thicknesses. Here we report on the engineering of an antiferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic interlayer exchange coupling (AF-IEC) between ultrathin but ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic La<sub>2/3</sub>Ca<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> layers across an insulating CaRu<sub>1/2</sub>Ti<sub>1/2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> spacer. The layer-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic switching leads to sharp steplike hysteresis loops with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization plateaus depending on the repetition number of the stacking bilayers. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization configurations can be switched at moderate fields of hundreds of oersted. Moreover, the AF-IEC can also be realized with an alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic layer of La<sub>2/3</sub>Sr<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> that possesses a Curie temperature near room temperature. The findings will add functionalities to devices with correlated-oxide interfaces.</p>

Structure, force balance, and topology of Earth’s magnetopause
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>opause deflects the solar wind plasma and confines Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. We combine measurements made by the four spacecraft of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ospheric Multiscale mission to demonstrate how the plasma and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic forces at the boundary affect the interaction between the shocked solar wind and Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>osphere. We compare these forces with the plasma pressure and examine the electron distribution function. We find that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>opause has sublayers with thickness comparable to the ion scale. Small pockets of low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field strength, small radius of curvature, and high electric current mark the electron diffusion region. The flow of electrons, parallel and antiparallel to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field, reveals a complex topology with the creation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic ropes at the boundary.</p>

Probing and imaging spin interactions with a magnetic single-molecule sensor
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic single atoms and molecules are receiving intensifying research focus because of their potential as the smallest possible memory, spintronic, and qubit elements. Scanning probe microscopes used to study these systems have benefited greatly from new techniques that use molecule-functionalized tips to enhance spatial and spectroscopic resolutions and enable new sensing capabilities. We demonstrate a microscopy technique that uses a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic molecule, Ni(cyclopentadienyl)<sub>2</sub>, adsorbed at the apex of a scanning probe tip, to sense exchange interactions with another molecule adsorbed on a Ag(110) surface in a continuously tunable fashion in all three spatial directions. We further used the probe to image contours of exchange interaction strength, revealing angstrom-scale regions where the quantum states of two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic molecules strongly mix. Our results pave the way for new nanoscale imaging capabilities based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic single-molecule sensors.</p>

Chirally coupled nanomagnets
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ically coupled nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s have multiple applications in nonvolatile memories, logic gates, and sensors. The most effective couplings have been found to occur between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic layers in a vertical stack. We achieved strong coupling of laterally adjacent nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s using the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This coupling is mediated by chiral domain walls between out-of-plane and in-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic regions and dominates the behavior of nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s below a critical size. We used this concept to realize lateral exchange bias, field-free current-induced switching between multistate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic configurations as well as synthetic antiferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s, skyrmions, and artificial spin ices covering a broad range of length scales and topologies.

Humans may sense Earth's magnetic field
<p>A study published this week offers some of the best evidence yet that humans, like many other creatures, can sense Earth's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. But it doesn't settle other questions that have swirled around this contentious idea for decades: If we do have a subconscious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic sense, do we ever use it? And does it arise from an iron mineral found in our brains, as the authors believe? The experiment recorded brain activity from electrodes on the scalp to search 34 participants for some response to changes in a highly controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field equal in strength to Earth's. It revealed a marked change in brain waves of a certain frequency. But some researchers aren't convinced that the brain's reaction to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field represents a true "sense" unless this reaction also guides our behavior.</p>

Electrical generation and detection of spin waves in a quantum Hall ferromagnet
<p>Spin waves are collective excitations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic systems. An attractive setting for studying long-lived spin-wave physics is the quantum Hall (QH) ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>, which forms spontaneously in clean two-dimensional electron systems at low temperature and in a perpendicular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. We used out-of-equilibrium occupation of QH edge channels in graphene to excite and detect spin waves in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ically ordered QH states. Our experiments provide direct evidence for long-distance spin-wave propagation through different ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic phases in the <i>N</i> = 0 Landau level, as well as across the insulating canted antiferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic phase. Our results will enable experimental investigation of the fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic properties of these exotic two-dimensional electron systems.</p>

Separation of enantiomers by their enantiospecific interaction with achiral magnetic substrates
<p>It is commonly assumed that recognition and discrimination of chirality, both in nature and in artificial systems, depend solely on spatial effects. However, recent studies have suggested that charge redistribution in chiral molecules manifests an enantiospecific preference in electron spin orientation. We therefore reasoned that the induced spin polarization may affect enantiorecognition through exchange interactions. Here we show experimentally that the interaction of chiral molecules with a perpendicularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ized substrate is enantiospecific. Thus, one enantiomer adsorbs preferentially when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic dipole is pointing up, whereas the other adsorbs faster for the opposite alignment of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization. The interaction is not controlled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field per se, but rather by the electron spin orientations, and opens prospects for a distinct approach to enantiomeric separations.</p>

Chiromagnetic nanoparticles and gels
<p>Chiral inorganic nanostructures have high circular dichroism, but real-time control of their optical activity has so far been achieved only by irreversible chemical changes. Field modulation is a far more desirable path to chiroptical devices. We hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field modulation can be attained for chiral nanostructures with large contributions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic transition dipole moments to polarization rotation. We found that dispersions and gels of para<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with chiral distortions of the crystal lattices exhibited chiroptical activity in the visible range that was 10 times as strong as that of nonpara<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic nanoparticles of comparable size. Transparency of the nanoparticle gels to circularly polarized light beams in the ultraviolet range was reversibly modulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields. These phenomena were also observed for other nanoscale metal oxides with lattice distortions from imprinted amino acids and other chiral ligands. The large family of chiral ceramic nanostructures and gels can be pivotal for new technologies and knowledge at the nexus of chirality and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ism.</p>

Early Use of N-acetylcysteine With Nitrate Therapy in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Reduces Myocardial Infarct Size (the NACIAM Trial [N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Contemporary ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction management involves primary percutaneous coronary intervention, with ongoing studies focusing on infarct size reduction using ancillary therapies.

High-Sensitive Cardiac Troponin T as an Early Biochemical Signature for Clinical and Subclinical Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although small elevations of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) are associated with incident heart failure (HF) in the general population, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. Evaluating the association of hs-cTnT with replacement fibrosis and progression of structural heart disease before symptoms is fundamental to understanding the potential of this biomarker in a HF prevention strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We measured hs-cTnT at baseline among 4986 participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a cohort initially free of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance imaging was performed at baseline. Repeat cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance was performed 10 years later among 2831 participants who remained free of interim CVD events; of these, 1723 received gadolinium-enhanced cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance for characterization of replacement fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement. Progression of subclinical CVD was defined by 10-year change in left ventricular structure and function. Associations of hs-cTnT with incident HF, CV-related mortality, and coronary heart disease were estimated using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Late gadolinium enhancement for replacement fibrosis was detectable in 6.3% participants without interim CVD events by follow-up cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance.

Higher hs-cTnT was also associated with a greater probability of an increase in LV mass >12% (highest category versus <limit of detection; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–2.07), but not with decline in left ventricular ejection fraction.

Magneto-Seebeck tunneling on the atomic scale
<p>The tunneling of spin-polarized electrons across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic tunnel junction driven by a temperature gradient is a fundamental process for the thermal control of electron spin transport. We experimentally investigated the atomic-scale details of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>o-Seebeck tunneling by placing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic probe tip in close proximity to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic sample at cryogenic temperature, with a vacuum as the tunneling barrier. Heating the tip and measuring the thermopower of the junction while scanning across the spin texture of the sample lead to spin-resolved Seebeck coefficients that can be mapped at atomic-scale lateral resolution. We propose a spin detector for spintronics applications that is driven solely by waste heat, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>o-Seebeck tunneling to convert spin information into a voltage that can be used for further data processing.</p>

Here we report the observation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold collisions between potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K) atoms and sodium-23–potassium-40 (<sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K) molecules in the rovibrational ground state. We prepare the atoms and molecules in various hyperfine levels of their ground states and observe the loss of molecules as a function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. The atom-molecule Feshbach resonances are identified by observing an enhancement of the loss. We have observed 11 resonances in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field range of 43 to 120 gauss. The observed atom-molecule Feshbach resonances at ultralow temperatures probe the three-body potential energy surface with exceptional resolution and will help to improve understanding of ultracold collisions.</p>

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor
<p>The anomalous metallic state in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates is masked by superconductivity near a quantum critical point. Applying high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields to suppress superconductivity has enabled detailed studies of the normal state, yet the direct effect of strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields on the metallic state is poorly understood. We report the high-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>oresistance of thin-film La<sub>2–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>Sr<i><sub>x</sub></i>CuO<sub>4</sub> cuprate in the vicinity of the critical doping, 0.161 ≤ <i>p</i> ≤ 0.190. We find that the metallic state exposed by suppressing superconductivity is characterized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>oresistance that is linear in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields up to 80 tesla. The magnitude of the linear-in-field resistivity mirrors the magnitude and doping evolution of the well-known linear-in-temperature resistivity that has been associated with quantum criticality in high-temperature superconductors.</p>

Phase transitions in a programmable quantum spin glass simulator
<p>Understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic phases in quantum mechanical systems is one of the essential goals in condensed matter physics, and the advent of prototype quantum simulation hardware has provided new tools for experimentally probing such systems. We report on the experimental realization of a quantum simulation of interacting Ising spins on three-dimensional cubic lattices up to dimensions 8 × 8 × 8 on a D-Wave processor (D-Wave Systems, Burnaby, Canada). The ability to control and read out the state of individual spins provides direct access to several order parameters, which we used to determine the lattice’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic phases as well as critical disorder and one of its universal exponents. By tuning the degree of disorder and effective transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field, we observed phase transitions between a para<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic, an antiferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic, and a spin-glass phase.</p>

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators
<p>Topological phases, like the Haldane phase in spin-1 chains, defy characterization through local order parameters. Instead, nonlocal string order parameters can be employed to reveal their hidden order. Similar diluted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of spin-charge separation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of nonlocal spin-density correlation functions reveals a hidden finite-range antiferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic order, a direct consequence of spin-charge separation. Our technique, which measures nonlocal order directly, can be readily extended to higher dimensions to study the complex interplay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic order and density fluctuations.</p>

Chiral Majorana fermion modes in a quantum anomalous Hall insulator–superconductor structure
<p>Majorana fermion is a hypothetical particle that is its own antiparticle. We report transport measurements that suggest the existence of one-dimensional chiral Majorana fermion modes in the hybrid system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film coupled with a superconductor. As the external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field is swept, half-integer quantized conductance plateaus are observed at the locations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization reversals, giving a distinct signature of the Majorana fermion modes. This transport signature is reproducible over many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field sweeps and appears at different temperatures.

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields of solar-type stars are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the turbulent convective layers of stars and have a complex dependency upon stellar rotation rate. We have performed a set of turbulent global simulations that exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic cycles varying systematically with stellar rotation and luminosity. We find that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of rotation on turbulent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type stars.</p>

Lifetime of the solar nebula constrained by meteorite paleomagnetism

However, the lifetime of the nebular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field and nebula are poorly constrained. We present paleo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic analyses of volcanic angrites demonstrating that they formed in a near-zero <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field (<0.6 microtesla) at 4563.5 ± 0.1 million years ago, ~3.8 million years after solar system formation. This indicates that the solar nebula field, and likely the nebular gas, had dispersed by this time. This sets the time scale for formation of the gas giants and planet migration. Furthermore, it supports formation of chondrules after 4563.5 million years ago by non-nebular processes like planetesimal collisions. The core dynamo on the angrite parent body did not initiate until about 4 to 11 million years after solar system formation.</p>

Measuring Hall viscosity of graphene’s electron fluid
<p>An electrical conductor subjected to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field exhibits the Hall effect in the presence of current flow. Here, we report a qualitative deviation from the standard behavior in electron systems with high viscosity. We found that the viscous electron fluid in graphene responds to nonquantizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields by producing an electric field opposite to that generated by the ordinary Hall effect. The viscous contribution is substantial and identified by studying local voltages that arise in the vicinity of current-injecting contacts. We analyzed the anomaly over a wide range of temperatures and carrier densities and extracted the Hall viscosity, a dissipationless transport coefficient that was long identified theoretically but remained elusive in experiments.</p>

Observation of chiral zero mode in inhomogeneous three-dimensional Weyl metamaterials
<p>Owing to the chirality of Weyl nodes, the Weyl systems can support one-way chiral zero modes under a strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field, which leads to nonconservation of chiral currents—the so-called chiral anomaly. Although promising for robust transport of optical information, the zero chiral bulk modes have not been observed in photonics. Here we design an inhomogeneous Weyl metamaterial in which a gauge field is generated for the Weyl nodes by engineering the individual unit cells. We experimentally confirm the presence of the gauge field and observe the zero-order chiral Landau level with one-way propagation. Without breaking the time-reversal symmetry, our system provides a route for designing an artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field in three-dimensional photonic Weyl systems and may have potential for device applications in photonics.</p>

The low-frequency source of Saturn’s kilometric radiation

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator

This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here, we report a notable exception in an insulator—ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB<sub>12</sub>). The resistivity of YbB<sub>12</sub>, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in metals, exhibits distinct quantum oscillations. These unconventional oscillations arise from the insulating bulk, even though the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of metals with a large effective mass. Quantum oscillations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic torque are also observed, albeit with a lighter effective mass.</p>

Interaction-driven quantum Hall wedding cake–like structures in graphene quantum dots

Coherent band excitations in CePd<sub>3</sub>: A comparison of neutron scattering and ab initio theory

Double-trap measurement of the proton magnetic moment at 0.3 parts per billion precision

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with elongation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial gradients for elongation rate, osmotic pressure, cell wall thickness, and wall mechanical compliances and coupled these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the polysaccharide composition, mobility, hydration, and intermolecular interactions of the inflorescence cell wall using solid-state nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering. Force-extension curves revealed a gradient, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-scattering curves showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal gradient in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance spectroscopy and thioacidolysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 coupling of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde coupling products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance as syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic acid and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively coupled into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic acid and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar platform industry.</p>

Prevalence of Subclinical Coronary Artery Disease in Masters Endurance Athletes With a Low Atherosclerotic Risk Profile
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies in middle-age and older (masters) athletes with atherosclerotic risk factors for coronary artery disease report higher coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores compared with sedentary individuals. Few studies have assessed the prevalence of coronary artery disease in masters athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed 152 masters athletes 54.4±8.5 years of age (70% male) and 92 controls of similar age, sex, and low Framingham 10-year coronary artery disease risk scores with an echocardiogram, exercise stress test, computerized tomographic coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and a 24-hour Holter. Athletes had participated in endurance exercise for an average of 31±12.6 years. The majority (77%) were runners, with a median of 13 marathon runs per athlete.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Most athletes (60%) and controls (63%) had a normal CAC score. Male athletes had a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques of any luminal irregularity (44.3% versus 22.2%; <i>P</i>=0.009) compared with sedentary males, and only male athletes showed a CAC ≥300 Agatston units (11.3%) and a luminal stenosis ≥50% (7.5%). Male athletes demonstrated predominantly calcific plaques (72.7%), whereas sedentary males showed predominantly mixed morphology plaques (61.5%). The number of years of training was the only independent variable associated with increased risk of CAC >70th percentile for age or luminal stenosis ≥50% in male athletes (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.15; <i>P</i>=0.016); 15 (14%) male athletes but none of the controls revealed late gadolinium enhancement on cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance imaging. Of these athletes, 7 had a pattern consistent with previous myocardial infarction, including 3(42%) with a luminal stenosis ≥50% in the corresponding artery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Most lifelong masters endurance athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile have normal CAC scores. Male athletes are more likely to have a CAC score >300 Agatston units or coronary plaques compared with sedentary males with a similar risk profile. The significance of these observations is uncertain, but the predominantly calcific morphology of the plaques in athletes indicates potentially different pathophysiological mechanisms for plaque formation in athletic versus sedentary men. Coronary plaques are more abundant in athletes, whereas their stable nature could mitigate the risk of plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

Diagnosis and Treatment of Fetal Cardiac Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The goal of this statement is to review available literature and to put forth a scientific statement on the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis and management of fetal cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association reviewed the available literature pertaining to topics relevant to fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and arrhythmias, assessment of cardiac function and the cardiovascular system, and available treatment options. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal diagnosis, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance imaging, and fetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical management for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for diseases affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention strategies to prevent the progression of disease in utero are also discussed. Recommendations for delivery planning strategies for fetuses with congenital heart disease including models based on classification of disease severity and delivery room treatment will be highlighted. Outcome assessment is reviewed to show the benefit of prenatal diagnosis and management as they affect outcome for babies with congenital heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Fetal cardiac medicine has evolved considerably over the past 2 decades, predominantly in response to advances in imaging technology and innovations in therapies. The diagnosis of cardiac disease in the fetus is mostly made with ultrasound; however, new technologies, including 3- and 4-dimensional echocardiography, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance imaging, and fetal electrocardiography and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ocardiography, are available. Medical and interventional treatments for select diseases and strategies for delivery room care enable stabilization of high-risk fetuses and contribute to improved outcomes. This statement highlights what is currently known and recommended on the basis of evidence and experience in the rapidly advancing and highly specialized field of fetal cardiac care.</p></sec>

Evolution of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish mineralocorticoid receptors: Allosteric influence on steroid specificity
<p>Although multiple steroid ligands of the glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and progestin families bind to and regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), the responses to these ligands differ across species. To understand how the different domains of MRs contribute to the ligand-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation or inhibition of MR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, we studied the response to eight steroids (aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, corticosterone, progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone) of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish full-length MRs and truncated MRs, which lacked the N-terminal domain (NTD) and DNA binding domain (DBD). Compared to full-length MRs, some truncated MRs were not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by the steroids, and others required higher steroid concentrations for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate full-length or truncated human, alligator, or frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these steroids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs, whereas at 100 nM, these steroids had little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity for truncated chicken MRs, but they retained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity for truncated zebrafish MRs. This suggests that regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the chicken MR by progestin resides in the NTD-DBD and that of the zebrafish MR resides in the hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser<sup>810</sup> in human MR, which is required for the antagonist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of progesterone for human MR, suggesting a previously uncharacterized mechanism of regulation of progestin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of chicken and zebrafish MRs. These findings suggest that progesterone may be a physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator of chicken and zebrafish MRs.</p>

Analysis of Posttranslational Activation of Alternative Oxidase Isoforms
<p>Mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) in plants is a non-proton-motive ubiquinol oxidase that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by redox mechanisms and 2-oxo acids. A comparative analysis of the AOX isoenzymes AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) revealed that cysteine residues, CysI and CysII, are both involved in 2-oxo acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation, with AOX1A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity being more increased by 2-oxo acids than that of AOX1C and AOX1D. Substitution of cysteine in AOX1A by glutamate mimicked its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by pyruvate or glyoxylate, but not in AOX1C and AOX1D. CysIII, only present in AOX1A, is not involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by reduction or metabolites, but substitutions at this position affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. AOX1A carrying a serine residue at position CysI was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by succinate, while correspondingly substituted variants of AOX1C and AOX1D were insensitive. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by glutamate at CysI and CysII is consistent with the formation of the thiohemiacetal, while succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation after changing CysI to serine suggests hemiacetal formation. Surprisingly, in AOX1A, replacement of CysI by alanine, which cannot form a (thio)hemiacetal, led to even higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities, pointing to an alternative mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AOX isoforms are differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation at CysI and CysII is additive.</p>

Cardiovascular Consequences of Childhood Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure: Prevailing Evidence, Burden, and Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although public health programs have led to a substantial decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e are by no means a thing of the past. In the United States, 4 of 10 school-aged children and 1 of 3 adolescents are involuntarily exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS), with children of minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in low-socioeconomic-status households being disproportionately affected (68% and 43%, respectively). Children are particularly vulnerable, with little control over home and social environment, and lack the understanding, agency, and ability to avoid SHS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e on their own volition; they also have physiological or behavioral characteristics that render them especially susceptible to effects of SHS. Side-stream smoke (the smoke emanating from the burning end of the cigarette), a major component of SHS, contains a higher concentration of some toxins than mainstream smoke (inhaled by the smoker directly), making SHS potentially as dangerous as or even more dangerous than direct smoking. Compelling animal and human evidence shows that SHS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e during childhood is detrimental to arterial function and structure, resulting in premature atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular consequences. Childhood SHS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e is also related to impaired cardiac autonomic function and changes in heart rate variability. In addition, childhood SHS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e is associated with clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Individualized interventions to reduce childhood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e to SHS are shown to be at least modestly effective, as are broader-based policy initiatives such as community smoking bans and increased taxation.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>The purpose of this statement is to summarize the available evidence on the cardiovascular health consequences of childhood SHS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e; this will support ongoing efforts to further reduce and eliminate SHS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e in this vulnerable population. This statement reviews relevant data from epidemiological studies, laboratory-based experiments, and controlled behavioral trials concerning SHS and cardiovascular disease risk in children. Information on the effects of SHS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e on the cardiovascular system in animal and pediatric studies, including vascular disruption and platelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation, oxidation and inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular stiffness, changes in vascular structure, and autonomic dysfunction, is examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The epidemiological, observational, and experimental evidence accumulated to date demonstrates the detrimental cardiovascular consequences of SHS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications:</title><p>Increased awareness of the adverse, lifetime cardiovascular consequences of childhood SHS may facilitate the development of innovative individual, family-centered, and community health interventions to reduce and ideally eliminate SHS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e in the vulnerable pediatric population. This evidence calls for a robust public health policy that embraces zero tolerance of childhood SHS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e.</p></sec>

The pseudokinase domains of guanylyl cyclase–A and –B allosterically increase the affinity of their catalytic domains for substrate
<p>Natriuretic peptides regulate multiple physiologic systems by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating transmembrane receptors containing intracellular guanylyl cyclase domains, such as GC-A and GC-B, also known as Npr1 and Npr2, respectively. Both enzymes contain an intracellular, phosphorylated pseudokinase domain (PKD) critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the C-terminal cGMP-synthesizing guanylyl cyclase domain. Because ATP allosterically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates GC-A and GC-B, we investigated how ATP binding to the PKD influenced guanylyl cyclase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Molecular modeling indicated that all the residues of the ATP-binding site of the prototypical kinase PKA, except the catalytic aspartate, are conserved in the PKDs of GC-A and GC-B. Kinase-in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating alanine substitutions for the invariant lysine in subdomain II or the aspartate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-B failed to decrease enzyme phosphate content, consistent with the PKDs lacking kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. In contrast, both mutations reduced enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by blocking the ability of ATP to decrease the Michaelis constant without affecting peptide-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. The analogous lysine-to-alanine substitution in a glutamate-substituted phosphomimetic mutant form of GC-B also reduced enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, consistent with ATP stimulating guanylyl cyclase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity through an allosteric, phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Mutations designed to rigidify the conserved regulatory or catalytic spines within the PKDs increased guanylyl cyclase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, increased sensitivity to natriuretic peptide, or reduced the Michaelis constant in the absence of ATP, consistent with ATP binding stabilizing the PKD in a conformation analogous to that of catalytically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e kinases. We conclude that allosteric mechanisms evolutionarily conserved in the PKDs promote the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases.</p>

In <i>Drosophila</i>, RhoGEF2 cooperates with activated Ras in tumorigenesis through a pathway involving Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II and JNK signalling
<p>The <i>Ras</i> oncogene contributes to ∼30% of human cancers, but alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis. In a <i>Drosophila</i> screen for oncogenes that cooperate with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated allele of <i>Ras</i> (<i>Ras<sup>ACT</sup></i>) to promote tissue overgrowth and invasion, we identified the GTP exchange factor <i>RhoGEF2</i>, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator of Rho-family signalling. Here, we show that RhoGEF2 also cooperates with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated allele of a downstream effector of Ras, <i>Raf</i> (<i>Raf<sup>GOF</sup></i>). We dissect the downstream pathways through which RhoGEF2 cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> (and Raf<sup>GOF</sup>), and show that RhoGEF2 requires Rho1, but not Rac, for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, of the Rho1 effectors, we show that RhoGEF2 + Ras (Raf)-mediated tumorigenesis requires the Rho kinase (Rok)–Myosin-II pathway, but not Diaphanous, Lim kinase or protein kinase N. The Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II pathway leads to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Jun kinase (JNK), in cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>. Moreover, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Rok or Myosin II, using constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e transgenes, is sufficient for cooperative tumorigenesis with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>, and together with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> leads to strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of JNK. Our results show that Rok–Myosin-II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity is necessary and sufficient for Ras-mediated tumorigenesis. Our observation that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Myosin II, which regulates Filamentous actin (F-actin) contractility without affecting F-actin levels, cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> to promote JNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and tumorigenesis, suggests that increased cell contractility is a key factor in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we show that signalling via the Tumour necrosis factor (TNF; also known as Egr)-ligand–JNK pathway is most likely the predominant pathway that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates JNK upon Rok <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Overall, our analysis highlights the need for further analysis of the Rok–Myosin-II pathway in cooperation with Ras in human cancers.</p>

Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Microparticles (MPs) have emerged as a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. This study examined the potential of MPs from senescent endothelial cells (ECs) or from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to promote premature EC aging and thrombogenicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Primary porcine coronary ECs were isolated from the left circumflex coronary artery. MPs were prepared from ECs and venous blood from patients with ACS (n=30) and from healthy volunteers (n=4) by sequential centrifugation. The level of endothelial senescence was assessed as senescence-associated β-galactosidase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity using flow cytometry, oxidative stress using the redox-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, tissue factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity using an enzymatic Tenase assay, the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> protein expression by Western blot analysis, platelet aggregation using an aggregometer, and shear stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Senescence, as assessed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, was induced by the passaging of porcine coronary artery ECs from passage P1 to P4, and was associated with a progressive shedding of procoagulant MPs. Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and upregulated AT1 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 ECs. Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, and inhibitors of either mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinases or phosphoinositide 3-kinase prevented the MP-induced endothelial senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients induce premature endothelial senescence under atheroprone low shear stress and thrombogenicity through angiotensin II–induced redox-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt.

Targeting nucleotide exchange to inhibit constitutively active G protein α subunits in cancer cells
<p>Constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e G protein α subunits cause cancer, cholera, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and other disorders. Therapeutic intervention by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed inhibition of constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα subunits in these disorders has yet to be achieved. We found that constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα<sub>q</sub> in uveal melanoma (UM) cells was inhibited by the cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR). FR allosterically inhibited guanosine diphosphate–for–guanosine triphosphate (GDP/GTP) exchange to trap constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα<sub>q</sub> in in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e, GDP-bound Gαβγ heterotrimers. Allosteric inhibition of other Gα subunits was achieved by the introduction of an FR-binding site. In UM cells driven by constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα<sub>q</sub>, FR inhibited second messenger signaling, arrested cell proliferation, reinstated melanocytic differentiation, and stimulated apoptosis. In contrast, FR had no effect on <i>BRAF</i>-driven UM cells.

Constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα<sub>q</sub> and PRC2 therefore provide therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s for UM. The development of FR analogs specific for other Gα subunit subtypes may provide novel therapeutic approaches for diseases driven by constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα subunits or multiple G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing a single receptor is ineffective.</p>

Phosphorylation of the phosphatase PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that controls osteoclast activity and bone mass in vivo
<p>Bone resorption by osteoclasts is essential for bone homeostasis. The kinase Src promotes osteoclast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated in osteoclasts by the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase PTPROt. In other contexts, however, PTPROt can inhibit Src <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that PTPROt is bifunctional and can dephosphorylate Src both at its inhibitory residue Tyr<sup>527</sup> and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating residue Tyr<sup>416</sup>. Whereas wild-type and PTPROt knockout mice exhibited similar bone masses, mice in which a putative C-terminal phosphorylation site, Tyr<sup>399</sup>, in endogenous PTPROt was replaced with phenylalanine had increased bone mass and reduced osteoclast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Osteoclasts from the knock-in mice also showed reduced Src <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Experiments in cultured cells and in osteoclasts derived from both mouse strains demonstrated that the absence of phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>399</sup> caused PTPROt to dephosphorylate Src at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating site pTyr<sup>416</sup>. In contrast, phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> enabled PTPROt to recruit Src through Grb2 and to dephosphorylate Src at the inhibitory site Tyr<sup>527</sup>, thus stimulating Src <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. We conclude that reversible phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that selects between its opposing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities toward Src and maintains a coherent signaling output, and that blocking this phosphorylation event can induce physiological effects in vivo. Because most receptor-type tyrosine phosphatases contain potential phosphorylation sites at their C termini, we propose that preventing phosphorylation at these sites or its consequences may offer an alternative to inhibiting their catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity to achieve therapeutic benefit.</p>

“Disruptor” residues in the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) R12 subfamily attenuate the inactivation of Gα subunits
<p>Understanding the molecular basis of interaction specificity between RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) proteins and heterotrimeric (αβγ) G proteins would enable the manipulation of RGS-G protein interactions, explore their functions, and effectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> them therapeutically. RGS proteins are classified into four subfamilies (R4, R7, RZ, and R12) and function as negative regulators of G protein signaling by in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating Gα subunits. We found that the R12 subfamily members RGS10 and RGS14 had lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity than most R4 subfamily members toward the G<sub>i</sub> subfamily member Gα<sub>o</sub>. Using structure-based energy calculations with multiple Gα-RGS complexes, we identified R12-specific residues in positions that are predicted to determine the divergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of this subfamily. This analysis predicted that these residues, which we call “disruptor residues,” interact with the Gα helical domain. We engineered the R12 disruptor residues into the RGS domains of the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity R4 subfamily and found that these altered proteins exhibited reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Reciprocally, replacing the putative disruptor residues in RGS18 (a member of the R4 subfamily that exhibited low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>) with the corresponding residues from a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity R4 subfamily RGS protein increased its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Furthermore, the high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the R4 subfamily toward Gα<sub>o</sub> was independent of the residues in the homologous positions to the R12 subfamily and RGS18 disruptor residues. Thus, our results suggest that the identified RGS disruptor residues function as negative design elements that attenuate RGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity for specific Gα proteins.</p>

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission increased neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, reduced GABAergic transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, thus identifying potential pharmacological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated disorders.</p>

Neuronal activity drives FMRP- and HSPG-dependent matrix metalloproteinase function required for rapid synaptogenesis
<p>Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) functions modulate synapse formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent plasticity. Aberrant MMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity is implicated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disease caused by the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP and characterized by neurological dysfunction and intellectual disability. Gene expression studies in <i>Drosophila</i> suggest that Mmps cooperate with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp) to restrict trans-synaptic Wnt signaling and that synaptogenic defects in the fly model of FXS are alleviated by either inhibition of Mmp or genetic reduction of Dlp. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) glutamatergic synapse to test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent Dlp and Mmp intersections in the context of FXS. We found that rapid, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent synaptic bouton formation depended on secreted Mmp1. Acute neuronal stimulation reduced the abundance of Mmp2 but increased that of both Mmp1 and Dlp, as well as enhanced the colocalization of Dlp and Mmp1 at the synapse. Dlp function promoted Mmp1 abundance, localization, and proteolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity around synapses. Dlp glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains mediated this functional interaction with Mmp1. In the FXS fly model, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent increases in Mmp1 abundance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity were lost but were restored by reducing the amount of synaptic Dlp. The data suggest that neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-induced, HSPG-dependent Mmp regulation drives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent synaptogenesis and that this is impaired in FXS. Thus, exploring this mechanism further may reveal therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s that have the potential to restore synaptogenesis in FXS patients.</p>

TGF-β promotes PI3K-AKT signaling and prostate cancer cell migration through the TRAF6-mediated ubiquitylation of p85α
<p>Transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) is a pluripotent cytokine that regulates cell fate and plasticity in normal tissues and tumors. The multifunctional cellular responses evoked by TGF-β are mediated by the canonical SMAD pathway and by noncanonical pathways, including mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. We found that TGF-β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated PI3K in a manner dependent on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 polyubiquitylated the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α and promoted the formation of a complex between the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and p85α, which led to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of PI3K and AKT. Lys<sup>63</sup>-linked polyubiquitylation of p85α on Lys<sup>513</sup> and Lys<sup>519</sup> in the iSH2 (inter–Src homology 2) domain was required for TGF-β–induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of PI3K-AKT signaling and cell motility in prostate cancer cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated macrophages. Unlike the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of SMAD pathways, the TRAF6-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of PI3K and AKT was not dependent on the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of TβRI. In situ proximity ligation assays revealed that polyubiquitylation of p85α was evident in aggressive prostate cancer tissues. Thus, our data reveal a molecular mechanism by which TGF-β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates the PI3K-AKT pathway to drive cell migration.</p>

Loss and Gain of Human Acidic Mammalian Chitinase Activity by Nonsynonymous SNPs
<p>Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is implicated in asthma, allergic inflammation, and food processing. Little is known about genetic and evolutional regulation of chitinolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of AMCase. Here, we relate human AMCase polymorphisms to the mouse AMCase, and show that the highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e variants encoded by nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are consistent with the mouse AMCase sequence. The chitinolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the recombinant human AMCase was significantly lower than that of the mouse counterpart. By creating mouse-human chimeric AMCase protein we found that the presence of the N-terminal region of human AMCase containing conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e site residues reduced the enzymatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the molecule. We were able to significantly increase the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of human AMCase by amino acid substitutions encoded by nsSNPs (N45, D47, and R61) with those conserved in the mouse homologue (D45, N47, and M61). For abolition of the mouse AMCase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, introduction of M61R mutation was sufficient. M61 is conserved in most of primates other than human and orangutan as well as in other mammals. Orangutan has I61 substitution, which also markedly reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the mouse AMCase, indicating that the M61 is a crucial residue for the chitinolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Altogether, our data suggest that human AMCase has lost its chitinolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity by integration of nsSNPs during evolution and that the enzyme can be re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by introducing amino acids conserved in the mouse counterpart.</p>

Modulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> signaling and ion transport by recruitment of kinases and phosphatases mediated by the regulatory protein IRBIT
<p>IRBIT is a multifunctional protein that controls the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of various epithelial ion transporters including NBCe1-B. Interaction with IRBIT increases NBCe1-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and exposes two cryptic Cl<sup>−</sup>-sensing GXXXP sites that enable regulation of NBCe1-B by intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>). Here, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that IRBIT controlled five phosphorylation sites in NBCe1-B that determined both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e conformation of the transporter and its regulation by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Mutational analysis suggested that the phosphorylation status of Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> was regulated by IRBIT and determined whether NBCe1 transporters are in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e or in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e conformations. The absence of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, or Ser<sup>235</sup> produced NBCe1-B in the conformations pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, or pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup>, respectively. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form was similar to that of IRBIT-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated NBCe1-B, but it was insensitive to inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. The properties of the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form were similar to those of wild-type NBCe1-B, whereas the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup> form was partially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e, further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by IRBIT, but retained inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Furthermore, IRBIT recruited the phosphatase PP1 and the kinase SPAK to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>65</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>32</sup>GXXXP<sup>36</sup> motif. IRBIT also recruited the phosphatase calcineurin and the kinase CaMKII to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>12</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>194</sup>GXXXP<sup>198</sup> motif. Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> are conserved in all NBCe1 variants and affect their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. These findings reveal how multiple kinase and phosphatase pathways use phosphorylation sites to fine-tune a transporter, which have important implications for epithelial fluid and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> secretion.</p>

The inositol phosphatase SHIP2 enables sustained ERK activation downstream of FGF receptors by recruiting Src kinases
<p>Sustained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) drives pathologies caused by mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). We previously identified the inositol phosphatase SHIP2 (also known as INPPL1) as an FGFR-interacting protein and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> of the tyrosine kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities of FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4. We report that loss of SHIP2 converted FGF-mediated sustained ERK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation into a transient signal and rescued cell phenotypes triggered by pathologic FGFR-ERK signaling. Mutant forms of SHIP2 lacking phosphoinositide phosphatase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity still associated with FGFRs and did not prevent FGF-induced sustained ERK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation, demonstrating that the adaptor rather than the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of SHIP2 was required. SHIP2 recruited Src family kinases to the FGFRs, which promoted FGFR-mediated phosphorylation and assembly of protein complexes that relayed signaling to ERK. SHIP2 interacted with FGFRs, was phosphorylated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e FGFRs, and promoted FGFR-ERK signaling at the level of phosphorylation of the adaptor FRS2 and recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11. Thus, SHIP2 is an essential component of canonical FGF-FGFR signal transduction and a potential therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> in FGFR-related disorders.</p>

YAP-mediated mechanotransduction determines the podocyte’s response to damage
<p>Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells of the kidney filtration barrier. They are subjected to physiological filtration pressure and considerable mechanical strain, which can be further increased in various kidney diseases. When injury causes cytoskeletal reorganization and morphological alterations of these cells, the filtration barrier may become compromised and allow proteins to leak into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Using time-resolved proteomics, we showed that podocyte injury stimulated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the transcriptional co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator YAP and the expression of YAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes in a rat model of glomerular disease before the development of proteinuria. Although the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities of YAP and its ortholog TAZ are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by mechanical stress in most cell types, injury reduced YAP and TAZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in cultured human and mouse podocyte cell lines grown on stiff substrates. Culturing these cells on soft matrix or inhibiting stress fiber formation recapitulated the damage-induced YAP up-regulation observed in vivo, indicating a mechanotransduction-dependent mechanism of YAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in podocytes. YAP overexpression in cultured podocytes increased the abundance of extracellular matrix–related proteins that can contribute to fibrosis. YAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity was increased in mouse models of diabetic nephropathy, and the YAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> <i>CTGF</i> was highly expressed in renal biopsies from glomerular disease patients. Although overexpression of human YAP in mice induced mild proteinuria, pharmacological inhibition of the interaction between YAP and its partner TEAD in rats ameliorated glomerular disease and reduced damage-induced mechanosignaling in the glomeruli. Thus, perturbation of YAP-dependent mechanosignaling is a potential therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> for treating some glomerular diseases.</p>

The DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome controls radiation-induced cell death and tissue injury
<p>Acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ionizing radi</span></strong>ation induces massive cell death and severe damage to tissues containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ely proliferating cells, including bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology remain controversial. Here, we show that mice deficient in the double-stranded DNA sensor AIM2 are protected from both subtotal body ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion–induced gastrointestinal syndrome and total body ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion–induced hematopoietic failure. AIM2 mediates the caspase-1–dependent death of intestinal epithelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to double-strand DNA breaks caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ionizing radi</span></strong>ation and chemotherapeutic agents. Mechanistically, we found that AIM2 senses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion-induced DNA damage in the nucleus to mediate inflammasome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and cell death.

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Satellite cell activation and populations on single muscle-fiber cultures from adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)
<p>Satellite cells (SCs), stem cells in skeletal muscle, are mitotically quiescent in adult mammals until <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated for growth or regeneration. In mouse muscle, SCs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the mechanically induced NO–HGF signaling cascade. Here, the SC population on fibers from the adult, ectothermic zebrafish and SC responsiveness to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating stimuli were assessed using the model system of isolated fibers cultured at 27 and 21°C. SCs were identified by immunostaining for the HGF receptor, c-met, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine uptake in culture or <i>in vivo</i>. In dose–response studies, SC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation was increased by treatment with the NO-donor drug isosorbide dinitrate (1 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) or HGF (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) to maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation at lower concentrations of both than in previous studies of mouse fibers. HGF-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation was blocked by anti-c-met antibody, and reduced by culture at 21°C. The effect of cyclical stretch (3 h at 4 cycles per minute) increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and was blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibition and reduced by culture at 21°C. The number of c-met+ SCs per fiber increased rapidly (by 3 h) after stretching. The character of signaling in SC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation on zebrafish fibers, in particular temperature-dependent responses to HGF and stretch, gives new insights into the influence of ectothermy on regulation of muscle growth in teleosts and suggests the use of the single-fiber model system to explore the basis of fiber hyperplasia and the conservation of regulatory pathways between species.</p>

Co-activation of microRNAs by Zelda is essential for early <i>Drosophila</i> development
<p>Transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs) are two important classes of <i>trans</i>-regulators in differential gene expression. Transcription factors occupy <i>cis</i>-regulatory motifs in DNA to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate or repress gene transcription, whereas miRNAs specifically pair with seed sites in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> mRNAs to trigger mRNA decay or inhibit translation. Dynamic spatiotemporal expression patterns of transcription factors and miRNAs during development point to their stage- and tissue-specific functions. Recent studies have focused on miRNA functions during development; however, much remains to explore regarding how the expression of miRNAs is initiated and how dynamic miRNA expression patterns are achieved by transcriptional regulatory networks at different developmental stages. Here, we focused on the identification, regulation and function of miRNAs during the earliest stage of <i>Drosophila</i> development, when the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) takes place. Eleven miRNA clusters comprise the first set of miRNAs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated in the blastoderm embryo. The transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator Zelda is required for their proper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and regulation, and Zelda binding observed in genome-wide binding profiles is predictive of enhancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. In addition, other blastoderm transcription factors, comprising both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ators and repressors, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities of which are potentiated and coordinated by Zelda, contribute to the accurate temporal and spatial expression of these miRNAs, which are known to function in diverse developmental processes. Although previous genetic studies showed no early phenotypes upon loss of individual miRNAs, our analysis of the <i>miR-1; miR-9a</i> double mutant revealed defects in gastrulation, demonstrating the importance of co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of miRNAs by Zelda during the MZT.</p>

BEND6 is a nuclear antagonist of Notch signaling during self-renewal of neural stem cells
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the Notch pathway revolves around a CSL-class transcription factor, which recruits distinct complexes that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate or repress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> gene expression. The co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator complex is deeply conserved and includes the cleaved Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and Mastermind. By contrast, numerous CSL co-repressor proteins have been identified, and these are mostly different between invertebrate and vertebrate systems. In this study, we demonstrate that mammalian BEND6 is a neural BEN-solo factor that shares many functional attributes with <i>Drosophila</i> Insensitive, a co-repressor for the <i>Drosophila</i> CSL factor. BEND6 binds the mammalian CSL protein CBF1 and antagonizes Notch-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. In addition, its association with Notch- and CBF1-regulated enhancers is promoted by CBF1 and antagonized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated Notch. <i>In utero</i> electroporation experiments showed that ectopic BEND6 inhibited Notch-mediated self-renewal of neocortical neural stem cells and promoted neurogenesis. Conversely, knockdown of BEND6 increased NSC self-renewal in wild-type neocortex, and exhibited genetic interactions with gain and loss of Notch pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. We recapitulated all of these findings in cultured neurospheres, in which overexpression and depletion of BEND6 caused reciprocal effects on neural stem cell renewal and neurogenesis. These data reveal a novel mammalian CSL co-repressor in the nervous system, and show that the Notch-inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of certain BEN-solo proteins is conserved between flies and mammals.</p>

Exercise-Induced Changes in Glucose Metabolism Promote Physiological Cardiac Growth
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Exercise promotes metabolic remodeling in the heart, which is associated with physiological cardiac growth; however, it is not known whether or how physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity–induced changes in cardiac metabolism cause myocardial remodeling. In this study, we tested whether exercise-mediated changes in cardiomyocyte glucose metabolism are important for physiological cardiac growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used radiometric, immunologic, metabolomic, and biochemical assays to measure changes in myocardial glucose metabolism in mice subjected to acute and chronic treadmill exercise. To assess the relevance of changes in glycolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, we determined how cardiac-specific expression of mutant forms of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase affect cardiac structure, function, metabolism, and gene programs relevant to cardiac remodeling. Metabolomic and transcriptomic screenings were used to identify metabolic pathways and gene sets regulated by glycolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Exercise acutely decreased glucose utilization via glycolysis by modulating circulating substrates and reducing phosphofructokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity; however, in the recovered state following exercise adaptation, there was an increase in myocardial phosphofructokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and glycolysis. In mice, cardiac-specific expression of a kinase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase transgene (Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice) lowered glycolytic rate and regulated the expression of genes known to promote cardiac growth. Hearts of Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice had larger myocytes, enhanced cardiac function, and higher capillary-to-myocyte ratios. Expression of phosphatase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase in the heart (Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> mice) increased glucose utilization and promoted a more pathological form of hypertrophy devoid of transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the physiological cardiac growth program. Modulation of phosphofructokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity was sufficient to regulate the glucose–fatty acid cycle in the heart; however, metabolic inflexibility caused by invariantly low or high phosphofructokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity caused modest mitochondrial damage.

SIRT2 Acts as a Cardioprotective Deacetylase in Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pathological cardiac hypertrophy induced by stresses such as aging and neurohumoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation is an independent risk factor for heart failure and is considered a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> for the treatment of heart failure. However, the mechanisms underlying pathological cardiac hypertrophy remain largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the roles of SIRT2 in aging-related and angiotensin II (Ang II)–induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Male C57BL/6J wild-type and <i>Sirt2</i> knockout mice were subjected to the investigation of aging-related cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy was also induced by Ang II (1.3 mg/kg/d for 4 weeks) in male C57BL/6J <i>Sirt2</i> knockout mice, cardiac-specific <i>SIRT2</i> transgenic (<i>SIRT2</i>-Tg) mice, and their respective littermates (8 to ≈12 weeks old). Metformin (200 mg/kg/d) was used to treat wild-type and <i>Sirt2</i> knockout mice infused with Ang II. Cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac function were examined in these mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SIRT2 protein expression levels were downregulated in hypertrophic hearts from mice. <i>Sirt2</i> knockout markedly exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and decreased cardiac ejection fraction and fractional shortening in aged (24-month-old) mice and Ang II–infused mice. Conversely, cardiac-specific <i>SIRT2</i> overexpression protected the hearts against Ang II–induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and rescued cardiac function. Mechanistically, SIRT2 maintained the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of AMP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinase (AMPK) in aged and Ang II–induced hypertrophic hearts in vivo as well as in cardiomyocytes in vitro. We identified the liver kinase B1 (LKB1), the major upstream kinase of AMPK, as the direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> of SIRT2. SIRT2 bound to LKB1 and deacetylated it at lysine 48, which promoted the phosphorylation of LKB1 and the subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of LKB1-AMPK signaling. Remarkably, the loss of SIRT2 blunted the response of AMPK to metformin treatment in mice infused with Ang II and repressed the metformin-mediated reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and protection of cardiac function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SIRT2 promotes AMPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by deacetylating the kinase LKB1. Loss of SIRT2 reduces AMPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation, promotes aging-related and Ang II–induced cardiac hypertrophy, and blunts metformin-mediated cardioprotective effects. These findings indicate that SIRT2 will be a potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> for therapeutic interventions in aging- and stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy.</p></sec>

Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Older Women After Contemporary Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes are resistant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion.

Radiotherapy for breast cancer results in variable cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e and may increase the risk of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a population-based case-control study of incident HF in 170 female residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (59 cases and 111 controls), who underwent contemporary (1998–2013) radiotherapy for breast cancer with computed tomography–assisted radiotherapy planning. Controls were matched to cases for age, tumor side, chemotherapy use, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Mean cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion dose (MCRD) in each patient was calculated from the patient’s computed tomography images and radiotherapy plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean age at radiotherapy was 69±9 years. Of HF cases, 38 (64%) had EF≥50% (HFpEF), 18 (31%) had EF<50% (HF with reduced EF), and 3 (5%) did not have EF measured. The EF was ≥40% in 50 of the 56 HF cases (89%) with an EF measurement. The mean interval from radiotherapy to HF was 5.8±3.4 years. The odds of HF was higher in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or atrial fibrillation. The MCRD was 2.5 Gy (range, 0.2–13.1 Gy) and higher in cases (3.3±2.7 Gy) than controls (2.1±2.0 Gy; <i>P</i>=0.004). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HF per log MCRD was 9.1 (3.4–24.4) for any HF, 16.9 (3.9–73.7) for HFpEF, and 3.17 (0.8–13.0) for HF with reduced EF. The increased odds of any HF or HFpEF with increasing MCRD remained significant after adjustment for HF risk factors and in sensitivity analyses matching by cancer stage rather than tumor side. Only 18.6% of patients experienced new or recurrent ischemic events between radiotherapy and the onset of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The relative risk of HFpEF increases with increasing cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e during contemporary conformal breast cancer radiotherapy.

Targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas system in medaka
<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system-based RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN) has recently emerged as a simple and efficient tool for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed genome editing. In this study, we showed successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed mutagenesis using RGENs in medaka, <i>Oryzias latipes</i>. Somatic and heritable mutations were induced with high efficiency at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed genomic sequence on the <i>DJ-1</i> gene in embryos that had been injected with the single guide RNA (sgRNA) transcribed by a T7 promoter and capped RNA encoding a Cas9 nuclease. The sgRNAs that were designed for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genomic sequences without the 5′ end of GG required by the T7 promoter induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed mutations. This suggests that the RGEN can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> any sequence adjacent to an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, which occurs once every 8 bp. The off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> alterations at 2 genomic loci harboring double mismatches in the 18-bp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing sequences were induced in the RGEN-injected embryos. However, we also found that the off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> effects could be reduced by lower dosages of sgRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that CRISPR/Cas-mediated RGENs may be an efficient and flexible tool for genome editing in medaka.</p>

Manifold roles of β-arrestins in GPCR signaling elucidated with siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) use diverse mechanisms to regulate the mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinases ERK1/2. β-Arrestins (βArr1/2) are ubiquitous inhibitors of G protein signaling, promoting GPCR desensitization and internalization and serving as scaffolds for ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Studies using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete βArr1/2 and G proteins have cast doubt on the role of β-arrestins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating specific pools of ERK1/2. We compared the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of βArr1/2 and reconstitution with βArr1/2 in three different parental and CRISPR-derived βArr1/2 knockout HEK293 cell pairs to assess the effect of βArr1/2 deletion on ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by four G<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs. In all parental lines with all receptors, ERK1/2 stimulation was reduced by siRNAs specific for βArr2 or βArr1/2. In contrast, variable effects were observed with CRISPR-derived cell lines both between different lines and with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of different receptors. For β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors (β<sub>2</sub>ARs) and β<sub>1</sub>ARs, βArr1/2 deletion increased, decreased, or had no effect on isoproterenol-stimulated ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in different CRISPR clones. ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by the vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> and follicle-stimulating hormone receptors was reduced in these cells but was enhanced by reconstitution with βArr1/2. Loss of desensitization and receptor internalization in CRISPR βArr1/2 knockout cells caused β<sub>2</sub>AR-mediated stimulation of ERK1/2 to become more dependent on G proteins, which was reversed by reintroducing βArr1/2. These data suggest that βArr1/2 function as a regulatory hub, determining the balance between mechanistically different pathways that result in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of ERK1/2, and caution against extrapolating results obtained from βArr1/2- or G protein–deleted cells to GPCR behavior in native systems.</p>

Oncogenic RAS isoforms show a hierarchical requirement for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS2 to mediate cell transformation
<p>About a third of tumors have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating mutations in <i>HRAS</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, or <i>KRAS</i>, genes encoding guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) of the RAS family. In these tumors, wild-type RAS cooperates with mutant RAS to promote downstream effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and cell proliferation and transformation, suggesting that upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ators of wild-type RAS are important modulators of mutant RAS-driven oncogenesis. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SOS1 mediates KRAS-driven proliferation, but little is understood about the role of SOS2. We found that RAS family members have a hierarchical requirement for the expression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of SOS2 to drive cellular transformation. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), SOS2 critically mediated mutant KRAS-driven, but not HRAS-driven, transformation. <i>Sos2</i> deletion reduced epidermal growth factor (EGF)–dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of wild-type HRAS and phosphorylation of the kinase AKT in cells expressing mutant RAS isoforms. Assays using pharmacological inhibitors revealed a hierarchical requirement for signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in promoting RAS-driven cellular transformation that mirrored the requirement for SOS2. KRAS-driven transformation required the GEF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of SOS2 and was restored in <i>Sos2</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> MEFs by expression of constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated PI3K. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <i>SOS2</i> reduced EGF-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and synergized with MEK inhibition to revert the transformed phenotype of human <i>KRAS</i> mutant pancreatic and lung tumor cells. These results indicate that SOS2-dependent PI3K signaling mediates mutant KRAS-driven transformation, revealing therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s in KRAS-driven cancers. Our data also reveal the importance of three-dimensional culture systems in investigating the mediators of mutant KRAS.</p>

SOCE mediated by STIM and Orai is essential for pacemaker activity in the interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract
<p>Electrical pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity generates phasic contractions and motility patterns such as segmentation and peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract. Pacemaker currents are generated in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores that stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated Cl<sup>−</sup> channels (CaCCs) in the plasma membrane. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores must be maintained to sustain pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) facilitates the refilling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by a mechanism dependent upon interactions between STIM and Orai proteins. We investigated the role of SOCE in ICC pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Reintroduction of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in store-depleted ICC resulted in CaCC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Blocking CaCCs revealed an inwardly rectifying current with properties of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated current (<i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub>). An inhibitory peptide that interfered with the STIM-Orai interaction blocked <i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub> in HEK 293 cells expressing STIM1 and Orai1 and blocked spontaneous transient inward currents (STICs) and slow wave currents in ICC. STICs, which are fundamental pacemaker events in ICC, were blocked by an Orai antagonist. Imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients linked to pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in ICC in intact muscles showed that the Orai antagonist blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC. These data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> recovery through STIM-Orai interactions is necessary to maintain ICC pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity.</p>

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p>Lipid A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. Lipid A is recognized by the host immune system and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the phosphates of lipid A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different lipid A profiles when PmrA is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the lipid A phosphates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating the regulatory protein PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional phosphate group to lipid A. Later, PhoP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modification of the lipid A phosphates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modification of lipid A phosphates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in lipid A negative charge. Our findings demonstrate how bacteria tailor their cell surface to different stresses, such as those faced inside phagocytes.</p>

VEGF–neuropilin-2 signaling promotes stem-like traits in breast cancer cells by TAZ-mediated repression of the Rac GAP β2-chimaerin
<p>The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in cancer is not only well known in the context of angiogenesis but also important in the functional regulation of tumor cells. Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating tumor growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating cancer patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of TAZ in various breast cancer cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. In a complex with the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the gene encoding the Rac GTPase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating protein (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac signaling; hence, the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere formation. Analysis of a breast cancer patient database revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in tumors. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in a feed-forward loop of TAZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and the acquisition of CSC properties.</p>

Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 induce hydrocephalus in a catalytically dependent manner
<p>Catalytically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating mutations in <i>Ptpn11</i>, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause 50% of Noonan syndrome (NS) cases, whereas in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating mutations in <i>Ptpn11</i> are responsible for nearly all cases of the similar, but distinct, developmental disorder Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML; formerly called LEOPARD syndrome). However, both types of disease mutations are gain-of-function mutations because they cause SHP2 to constitutively adopt an open conformation. We found that the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of SHP2 was required for the pathogenic effects of gain-of-function, disease-associated mutations on the development of hydrocephalus in the mouse. Targeted pan-neuronal knockin of a <i>Ptpn11</i> allele encoding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e SHP2 E76K mutant resulted in hydrocephalus due to aberrant development of ependymal cells and their cilia. These pathogenic effects of the E76K mutation were suppressed by the additional mutation C459S, which abolished the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of SHP2. Moreover, ependymal cells in NSML mice bearing the in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e SHP2 mutant Y279C were also unaffected. Mechanistically, the SHP2 E76K mutant induced developmental defects in ependymal cells by enhancing dephosphorylation and inhibition of the transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator STAT3. Whereas STAT3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity was reduced in <i>Ptpn11</i><sup><i>E76K/+</i></sup> cells, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities of the kinases ERK and AKT were enhanced, and neural cell–specific <i>Stat3</i> knockout mice also manifested developmental defects in ependymal cells and cilia. These genetic and biochemical data demonstrate a catalytic-dependent role of SHP2 gain-of-function disease mutants in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus.</p>

MEK inhibitor trametinib does not prevent the growth of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)–addicted neuroblastomas
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is implicated in driving the initiation and progression of multiple cancers. Several inhibitors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing the RAS-MAPK pathway are clinically approved as single- or polyagent therapies for patients with specific types of cancer. One example is the MEK inhibitor trametinib, which is included as a rational polytherapy strategy for treating EML4-ALK–positive, EGFR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated, or KRAS-mutant lung cancers and neuroblastomas that also contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway. In addition, in neuroblastoma, a heterogeneous disease, relapse cases display an increased rate of mutations in <i>ALK</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, and <i>NF1</i>, leading to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of RAS-MAPK signaling. Co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing ALK and the RAS-MAPK pathway is an attr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e option, because monotherapies have not yet produced effective results in ALK-addicted neuroblastoma patients. We evaluated the response of neuroblastoma cell lines to MEK-ERK pathway inhibition by trametinib. In contrast to RAS-MAPK pathway-mutated neuroblastoma cell lines, ALK-addicted neuroblastoma cells treated with trametinib showed increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation (inferred by phosphorylation) of the kinases AKT and ERK5. This feedback response was mediated by the mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> of rapamycin complex 2–associated protein SIN1, resulting in increased survival and proliferation that depended on AKT signaling. In xenografts in mice, trametinib inhibited the growth of EML4-ALK–positive non–small cell lung cancer and RAS-mutant neuroblastoma but not ALK-addicted neuroblastoma. Thus, our results advise against the seemingly rational option of using MEK inhibitors to treat ALK-addicted neuroblastoma.</p>

Bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino acids suppress sinonasal innate immunity through sweet taste receptors in solitary chemosensory cells
<p>In the upper respiratory epithelium, bitter and sweet taste receptors present in solitary chemosensory cells influence antimicrobial innate immune defense responses. Whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) stimulates surrounding epithelial cells to release antimicrobial peptides, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the sweet taste receptor (T1R) in the same cells inhibits this response. This mechanism is thought to control the magnitude of antimicrobial peptide release based on the sugar content of airway surface liquid. We hypothesized that <sc>d</sc>-amino acids, which are produced by various bacteria and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate T1R in taste receptor cells in the mouth, may also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate T1R in the airway. We showed that both the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits of the sweet taste receptor (T1R2/3) were present in the same chemosensory cells of primary human sinonasal epithelial cultures. Respiratory isolates of <i>Staphylococcus</i> species, but not <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, produced at least two <sc>d</sc>-amino acids that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate the sweet taste receptor. In addition to inhibiting <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation, <sc>d</sc>-amino acids derived from <i>Staphylococcus</i> inhibited T2R-mediated signaling and defensin secretion in sinonasal cells by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating T1R2/3. <sc>d</sc>-Amino acid–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of T1R2/3 also enhanced epithelial cell death during challenge with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in the presence of the bitter receptor–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating compound denatonium benzoate. These data establish a potential mechanism for interkingdom signaling in the airway mediated by bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino acids and the mammalian sweet taste receptor in airway chemosensory cells.</p>

In silico modeling identifies CD45 as a regulator of IL-2 synergy in the NKG2D-mediated activation of immature human NK cells
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells perform immunosurveillance of virally infected and transformed cells, and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation depends on the balance between signaling by inhibitory and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating receptors. Cytokine receptor signaling can synergize with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating receptor signaling to induce NK cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. We investigated the interplay between the signaling pathways stimulated by the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating receptor NKG2D in immature (CD56<sup>bright</sup>) and mature (CD56<sup>dim</sup>) subsets of human primary NK cells using mass cytometry experiments and in silico modeling. Our analysis revealed that IL-2 changed the abundances of several key proteins, including NKG2D and the phosphatase CD45. Furthermore, we found differences in correlations between protein abundances, which were associated with the maturation state of the NK cells. The mass cytometry measurements also revealed that the signaling kinetics of key protein abundances induced by NKG2D stimulation depended on the maturation state and the pretreatment condition of the NK cells. Our in silico model, which described the multidimensional data with coupled first-order reactions, predicted that the increase in CD45 abundance was a major enhancer of NKG2D-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells but not in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells. This dependence on CD45 was verified by measurement of CD107a mobilization to the NK cell surface (a marker of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation). Our mathematical framework can be used to glean mechanisms underlying synergistic signaling pathways in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated immune cells.</p>

Cytoskeletal adaptivity regulates T cell receptor signaling
<p>The factors that govern T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation control the initiation and progression of adaptive immune responses. T cells recognize their cognate antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through the T cell receptor, which results in the formation of a contact region (immune synapse) between the two cells and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the T cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated T cells proliferate and differentiate into effector T cells that secrete cytokines, provide help to B cells, and kill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> cells. We asked whether the actin cytoskeleton governs differences in signaling in effector T cells versus naive (unstimulated) T cells. Using atomic force microscopy and quantitative confocal microscopy, we found that naive T cells had a mechanically stiffer cortical cytoskeleton than that of effector cells, which resulted in naive cells forming smaller immune synapses with APCs. This suggests that the cytoskeletal stiffness of the T cell before it undergoes antigen stimulation predicts its subsequent dynamic engagement with APCs and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation potential. Cytoskeletal rigidity depended on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the actin-severing enzyme cofilin through a pathway requiring the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoA and the kinases ROCK (Rho-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated kinase) and LIMK. These findings suggest that the baseline cytoskeletal state controls T cell responses and that the underlying pathway could be a therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> for modulating adaptive immunity.</p>

Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation by PKA stimulates the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and vasoconstriction during acute hyperglycemia and diabetes
<p>Hypercontractility of arterial myocytes and enhanced vascular tone during diabetes are, in part, attributed to the effects of increased glucose (hyperglycemia) on L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. In murine arterial myocytes, kinase-dependent mechanisms mediate the increase in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in response to increased extracellular glucose. We identified a subpopulation of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel pore-forming subunit (α1<sub>C</sub>) within nanometer proximity of protein kinase A (PKA) at the sarcolemma of murine and human arterial myocytes. This arrangement depended upon scaffolding of PKA by an A-kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150) in mice. Glucose-mediated increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity were associated with PKA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, leading to α1<sub>C</sub> phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1928</sup>. Compared to arteries from low-fat diet (LFD)–fed mice and nondiabetic patients, arteries from high-fat diet (HFD)–fed mice and from diabetic patients had increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Arterial myocytes and arteries from mice lacking AKAP150 or expressing mutant AKAP150 unable to bind PKA did not exhibit increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current density in response to increased glucose or to HFD. Consistent with a functional role for Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, arterial myocytes and arteries from knockin mice expressing a Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 with Ser<sup>1928</sup> mutated to alanine (S1928A) lacked glucose-mediated increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and vasoconstriction. Furthermore, the HFD-induced increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current density and myogenic tone were prevented in S1928A knockin mice. These findings reveal an essential role for α1<sub>C</sub> phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1928</sup> in stimulating Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and vasoconstriction by AKAP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed PKA upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposur</span></strong>e to increased glucose and in diabetes.</p>

Unbiased detection of CRISPR off-targets in vivo using DISCOVER-Seq
<p>CRISPR-Cas genome editing induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed DNA damage but can also affect off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> sites.

Functional degradation: A mechanism of NLRP1 inflammasome activation by diverse pathogen enzymes
<p>Inflammasomes are multiprotein platforms that initiate innate immunity by recruitment and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of caspase-1. The NLRP1B inflammasome is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated upon direct cleavage by the anthrax lethal toxin protease. However, the mechanism by which cleavage results in NLRP1B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation is unknown. In this study, we find that cleavage results in proteasome-mediated degradation of the amino-terminal domains of NLRP1B, liberating a carboxyl-terminal fragment that is a potent caspase-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator. Proteasome-mediated degradation of NLRP1B is both necessary and sufficient for NLRP1B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Consistent with our functional degradation model, we identify IpaH7.8, a <i>Shigella flexneri</i> ubiquitin ligase secreted effector, as an enzyme that induces NLRP1B degradation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Our results provide a unified mechanism for NLRP1B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by diverse pathogen-encoded enzymatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities.</p>

A molecular assembly phase transition and kinetic proofreading modulate Ras activation by SOS
<p>The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Son of Sevenless (SOS) is a key Ras <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator that is autoinhibited in the cytosol and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates upon membrane recruitment. Autoinhibition release involves structural rearrangements of the protein at the membrane and thus introduces a delay between initial recruitment and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. In this study, we designed a single-molecule assay to resolve the time between initial receptor-mediated membrane recruitment and the initiation of GEF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of individual SOS molecules on microarrays of Ras-functionalized supported membranes. The rise-and-fall shape of the measured SOS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation time distribution and the long mean time scale to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation (~50 seconds) establish a basis for kinetic proofreading in the receptor-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Ras.

Lysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging
<p>In the adult brain, the neural stem cell (NSC) pool comprises quiescent and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated populations with distinct roles. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that quiescent and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated NSCs exhibited differences in their protein homeostasis network. Whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated NSCs had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e proteasomes, quiescent NSCs contained large lysosomes. Quiescent NSCs from young mice accumulated protein aggregates, and many of these aggregates were stored in large lysosomes.

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive
<p>Water deprivation produces a drive to seek and consume water. How neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity creates this motivation remains poorly understood. We used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent genetic labeling to characterize neurons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by water deprivation in the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated MnPO neurons consist of a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>atory cell type. After optogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of these neurons, mice drank water and performed an operant lever-pressing task for water reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency. This stimulation was aversive, and instrumentally pausing stimulation could reinforce lever-pressing. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of these neurons gradually decreased over the course of an operant session. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of dehydration-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated MnPO neurons establishes a scalable, persistent, and aversive internal state that dynamically controls thirst-motivated behavior.</p>

The SUMO Conjugation Complex Self-Assembles into Nuclear Bodies Independent of SIZ1 and COP1
<p>Attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to substrate proteins modulates their turnover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, or interaction partners. However, how this SUMO conjugation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity concentrates the proteins involved and the substrates into uncharacterized nuclear bodies (NBs) remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized the requirements for SUMO NB formation and for their subsequent colocalization with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), a master regulator of plant growth. COP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity results in degradation of transcription factors, which primes the transcriptional response that underlies elongation growth induced by darkness and high ambient temperatures (skoto- and thermomorphogenesis, respectively). SUMO conjugation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity alone was sufficient to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> the SUMO machinery into NBs. Colocalization of these bodies with COP1 required, in addition to SUMO conjugation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, a SUMO acceptor site in COP1 and the SUMO E3 ligase SAP and Miz 1 (SIZ1). We found that SIZ1 docks in the substrate-binding pocket of COP1 via two valine-proline peptide motifs, which represent a known interaction motif of COP1 substrates. The data reveal that SIZ1 physically connects COP1 and SUMO conjugation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in the same NBs that can also contain the blue-light receptors CRYPTOCHROME 1 and CRYPTOCHROME 2. Our findings thus suggest that sumoylation stimulates COP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity within NBs. Moreover, the presence of SIZ1 and SUMO in these NBs explains how both the timing and amplitude of the high-temperature growth response is controlled. The strong colocalization of COP1 and SUMO in these NBs might also explain why many COP1 substrates are sumoylated.</p>

The MAPK Kinase Kinase GmMEKK1 Regulates Cell Death and Defense Responses
<p>MAPK signaling pathways play critical roles in plant immunity. Here, we silenced multiple genes encoding MAPKs using virus-induced gene silencing mediated by <i>Bean pod mottle virus</i> to identify MAPK genes involved in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) immunity. Surprisingly, a strong hypersensitive response (HR) cell death was observed when soybean <i>MAPK KINASE KINASE1</i> (<i>GmMEKK1</i>), a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>MEKK1</i>, was silenced. The HR was accompanied by the overaccumulation of defense signaling molecules, salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide. Genes involved in primary metabolism, translation/transcription, photosynthesis, and growth/development were down-regulated in <i>GmMEKK1-</i>silenced plants, while the expression of defense-related genes was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated. Accordingly, <i>GmMEKK1</i>-silenced plants were more resistant to downy mildew (<i>Peronospora manshurica</i>) and <i>Soybean mosaic virus</i> compared with control plants. Silencing <i>GmMEKK1</i> reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of GmMPK6 but enhanced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of <i>Gm</i>MPK3 in response to flg22 peptide. Unlike Arabidopsis MPK4, <i>Gm</i>MPK4 was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by either flg22 or SA. Interestingly, transient overexpression of <i>GmMEKK1</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> also induced HR. Our results indicate that <i>Gm</i>MEKK1 plays both positive and negative roles in immunity and appears to differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate downstream MPKs by promoting <i>Gm</i>MPK6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation but suppressing GmMPK3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in response to flg22. The involvement of <i>Gm</i>MPK4 kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in cell death and in flg22- or SA-triggered defense responses in soybean requires further investigation.</p>

Converging Light, Energy and Hormonal Signaling Control Meristem Activity, Leaf Initiation, and Growth<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>The development of leaf primordia is subject to light control of meristematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Light regulates the expression of thousands of genes with roles in cell proliferation, organ development, and differentiation of photosynthetic cells. Previous work has highlighted roles for hormone homeostasis and the energy-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase in meristematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, yet a picture of how these two regulatory mechanisms depend on light perception and interact with each other has yet to emerge. Their relevance beyond leaf initiation also is unclear. Here, we report the discovery that the dark-arrested meristematic region of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) experiences a local energy deprivation state and confirm previous findings that the PIN1 auxin transporter is diffusely localized in the dark. Light triggers a rapid removal of the starvation state and the establishment of PIN1 polar membrane localization consistent with auxin export, both preceding the induction of cell cycle- and cytoplasmic growth-associated genes. We demonstrate that shoot meristematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity can occur in the dark through the manipulation of auxin and cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity as well as through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of energy signaling, both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of photomorphogenesis action, but the organ developmental outcomes differ: while TOR-dependent energy signals alone stimulate cell proliferation, the development of a normal leaf lamina requires photomorphogenesis-like hormonal responses. We further show that energy signaling adjusts the extent of cell cycle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and growth of young leaves non-cellautonomously to available photosynthates and leads to organs constituted of a greater number of cells developing under higher irradiance. This makes energy signaling perhaps the most important biomass growth determinant under natural, unstressed conditions.</p>

TsNAC1 Is a Key Transcription Factor in Abiotic Stress Resistance and Growth
<p>NAC proteins constitute one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors, and a number of these proteins participate in the regulation of plant development and responses to abiotic stress. <i>T. HALOPHILA STRESS RELATED NAC1</i> (<i>TsNAC1</i>), cloned from the halophyte <i>Thellungiella halophila</i>, is a <i>NAC</i> transcription factor gene, and its overexpression can improve abiotic stress resistance, especially in salt stress tolerance, in both <i>T. halophila</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and retard the growth of these plants. In this study, the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of TsNAC1 and RD26 from Arabidopsis was compared with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes’ promoter regions of TsNAC1 from <i>T. halophila</i>, and the results showed that the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of TsNAC1 was higher in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) and yeast. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> sequence of the promoter from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes also was identified, and TsNAC1 was shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> the positive regulators of ion transportation, such as <i>T.

In addition, TsNAC1 negatively regulates the expansion of cells, inhibits <i>LIGHT-DEPENDENT SHORT HYPOCOTYLS1</i> and <i>UDP-XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE2</i>, and directly controls the expression of <i>MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA14</i>. Based on these results, we propose that TsNAC1 functions as an important upstream regulator of plant abiotic stress responses and vegetative growth.</p>

AIK1, A Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Modulates Abscisic Acid Responses through the MKK5-MPK6 Kinase Cascade<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction module involved in transducing extracellular signals to the nucleus for appropriate cellular adjustment. This cascade essentially consists of three components: a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAPK kinase, and a MAPK, connected to each other by the event of phosphorylation. Here, we report the characterization of a MAPKKK, ABA-INSENSITIVE PROTEIN KINASE1 (AIK1), which regulates abscisic acid (ABA) responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). T-DNA insertion mutants of AIK1 showed insensitivity to ABA in terms of both root growth and stomatal response. AIK1 functions in ABA responses via regulation of root cell division and elongation, as well as stomatal responses. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of AIK1 is induced by ABA in Arabidopsis and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>), and the Arabidopsis protein phosphatase type 2C, ABI1, a negative regulator of ABA signaling, restricts AIK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity by dephosphorylation. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis showed that MPK3, MPK6, and AIK1 interact with MKK5. The single mutant seedlings of <i>mpk6</i> and <i>mkk5</i> have similar phenotypes to <i>aik1</i>, but <i>mkk4</i> does not. AIK1 was localized in the cytoplasm and shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate MKK5 by protein phosphorylation, which was an ABA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated process. Constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e MKK5 in <i>aik1</i> mutant seedlings complements the ABA-insensitive root growth phenotype of <i>aik1</i>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of MPK6 was increased by ABA in wild-type seedlings, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by ABA was impaired in <i>aik1</i> and <i>aik1 mkk5</i> mutants. These findings clearly suggest that the AIK1-MKK5-MPK6 cascade functions in the ABA regulation of primary root growth and stomatal response.</p>

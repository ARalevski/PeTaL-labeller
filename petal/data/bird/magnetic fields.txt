Probing magnetism in 2D materials at the nanoscale with single-spin microscopy
<p>The discovery of ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals has generated widespread interest. Making further progress in this area requires quantitative knowledge of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic properties of vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>s at the nanoscale. We used scanning single-spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ometry based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers to image the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ization, localized defects, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic domains of atomically thin crystals of the vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong> chromium(III) iodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>). We determined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ization of CrI<sub>3</sub> monolayers to be ≈16 Bohr <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ons per square nanometer, with comparable values in samples with odd numbers of layers; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ization vanishes when the number of layers is even. We also found that structural modifications can induce switching between ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic and antiferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic interlayer ordering. These results demonstrate the benefit of using single-spin scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ometry to study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ism of 2D vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>s.</p>

Saturn’s magnetic field revealed by the Cassini Grand Finale
<p>During 2017, the Cassini fluxgate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ometer made in situ measurements of Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> at distances ~2550 ± 1290 kilometers above the 1-bar surface during 22 highly inclined Grand Finale orbits. These observations refine the extreme axisymmetry of Saturn’s internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> and show displacement of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic equator northward from the planet’s physical equator. Persistent small-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic structures, corresponding to high-degree (>3) axisymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic moments, were observed. This suggests secondary shallow dynamo action in the semiconducting region of Saturn’s interior. Some high-degree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic moments could arise from strong high-latitude concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic flux within the planet’s deep dynamo. A strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>-aligned current (FAC) system is located between Saturn and the inner edge of its D-ring, with strength comparable to the high-latitude auroral FACs.</p>

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures

Here, we report multiple-spin-filter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic tunnel junctions (sf-MTJs) based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which atomically thin chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) acts as a spin-filter tunnel barrier sandwiched between graphene contacts. We demonstrate tunneling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>oresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic circular dichroism measurements, we attribute these effects to the intrinsic layer-by-layer antiferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic ordering of the atomically thin CrI<sub>3</sub>. Our work reveals the possibility to push <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic information storage to the atomically thin limit and highlights CrI<sub>3</sub> as a superlative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic tunnel barrier for vdW heterostructure spintronic devices.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D van der Waals crystalline insulators via electron tunneling
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic insulators are a key resource for next-generation spintronic and topological devices.

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor
<p>The anomalous metallic state in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates is masked by superconductivity near a quantum critical point. Applying high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s to suppress superconductivity has enabled detailed studies of the normal state, yet the direct effect of strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s on the metallic state is poorly understood. We report the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>oresistance of thin-film La<sub>2–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>Sr<i><sub>x</sub></i>CuO<sub>4</sub> cuprate in the vicinity of the critical doping, 0.161 ≤ <i>p</i> ≤ 0.190.

Chiromagnetic nanoparticles and gels
<p>Chiral inorganic nanostructures have high circular dichroism, but real-time control of their optical activity has so far been achieved only by irreversible chemical changes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> modulation is a far more desirable path to chiroptical devices. We hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> modulation can be attained for chiral nanostructures with large contributions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic transition dipole moments to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization rotation. We found that dispersions and gels of para<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with chiral distortions of the crystal lattices exhibited chiroptical activity in the visible range that was 10 times as strong as that of nonpara<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic nanoparticles of comparable size. Transparency of the nanoparticle gels to circularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized light beams in the ultraviolet range was reversibly modulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s. These phenomena were also observed for other nanoscale metal oxides with lattice distortions from imprinted amino acids and other chiral ligands. The large family of chiral ceramic nanostructures and gels can be pivotal for new technologies and knowledge at the nexus of chirality and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ism.</p>

Humans may sense Earth's magnetic field
<p>A study published this week offers some of the best evidence yet that humans, like many other creatures, can sense Earth's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>. But it doesn't settle other questions that have swirled around this contentious idea for decades: If we do have a subconscious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic sense, do we ever use it? And does it arise from an iron mineral found in our brains, as the authors believe?

Quantized chiral edge conduction on domain walls of a magnetic topological insulator
<p>Electronic ordering in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic and dielectric materials forms domains with different signs of order parameters. The control of configuration and motion of the domain walls (DWs) enables nonvolatile responses against minute external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s. Here, we realize chiral edge states (CESs) on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic DWs of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic topological insulator.

The proof-of-concept devices based on reconfigurable CESs and Landauer-Buttiker formalism are realized for multiple-domain configurations with well-defined DW channels. Our results may lead to the realization of low-power-consumption spintronic devices.</p>

Defibrillation of soft porous metal-organic frameworks with electric fields

The switching of gas permeation upon E-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization could be explained by the structural transformation of the zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 into polymorphs with more rigid lattices. Permeation measurements under a direct-current E-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> poling of 500 volts per millimeter showed reversibly controlled switching of the ZIF-8 into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> polymorphs, which was confirmed by x-ray diffraction and ab initio calculations. The stiffening of the lattice causes a reduction in gas transport through the membrane and sharpens the molecular sieving capability. Dielectric spectroscopy, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization, and deuterium nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic resonance studies revealed low-frequency resonances of ZIF-8 that we attribute to lattice flexibility and linker movement.

All-oxide–based synthetic antiferromagnets exhibiting layer-resolved magnetization reversal
<p>Synthesizing antiferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>s with correlated oxides has been challenging, owing partly to the markedly degraded ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ism of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic layer at nanoscale thicknesses.

Separation of enantiomers by their enantiospecific interaction with achiral magnetic substrates
<p>It is commonly assumed that recognition and discrimination of chirality, both in nature and in artificial systems, depend solely on spatial effects. However, recent studies have suggested that charge redistribution in chiral molecules manifests an enantiospecific preference in electron spin orientation. We therefore reasoned that the induced spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization may affect enantiorecognition through exchange interactions. Here we show experimentally that the interaction of chiral molecules with a perpendicularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ized substrate is enantiospecific. Thus, one enantiomer adsorbs preferentially when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic dipole is pointing up, whereas the other adsorbs faster for the opposite alignment of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ization. The interaction is not controlled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> per se, but rather by the electron spin orientations, and opens prospects for a distinct approach to enantiomeric separations.</p>

Chirally coupled nanomagnets

We achieved strong coupling of laterally adjacent nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>s using the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This coupling is mediated by chiral domain walls between out-of-plane and in-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic regions and dominates the behavior of nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>s below a critical size.

Electrical generation and detection of spin waves in a quantum Hall ferromagnet
<p>Spin waves are collective excitations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic systems.

Lifetime of the solar nebula constrained by meteorite paleomagnetism
<p>A key stage in planet formation is the evolution of a gaseous and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ized solar nebula. However, the lifetime of the nebular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> and nebula are poorly constrained. We present <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paleo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ic analyses of volcanic angrites demonstrating that they formed in a near-zero <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> (<0.6 microtesla) at 4563.5 ± 0.1 million years ago, ~3.8 million years after solar system formation. This indicates that the solar nebula <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>, and likely the nebular gas, had dispersed by this time. This sets the time scale for formation of the gas giants and planet migration. Furthermore, it supports formation of chondrules after 4563.5 million years ago by non-nebular processes like planetesimal collisions. The core dynamo on the angrite parent body did not initiate until about 4 to 11 million years after solar system formation.</p>

Probing and imaging spin interactions with a magnetic single-molecule sensor
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic single atoms and molecules are receiving intensifying research focus because of their potential as the smallest possible memory, spintronic, and qubit elements. Scanning probe microscopes used to study these systems have benefited greatly from new techniques that use molecule-functionalized tips to enhance spatial and spectroscopic resolutions and enable new sensing capabilities. We demonstrate a microscopy technique that uses a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic molecule, Ni(cyclopentadienyl)<sub>2</sub>, adsorbed at the apex of a scanning probe tip, to sense exchange interactions with another molecule adsorbed on a Ag(110) surface in a continuously tunable fashion in all three spatial directions. We further used the probe to image contours of exchange interaction strength, revealing angstrom-scale regions where the quantum states of two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic molecules strongly mix. Our results pave the way for new nanoscale imaging capabilities based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic single-molecule sensors.</p>

Observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K + <sup>40</sup>K collisions
<p>Resonances in ultracold collisions involving heavy molecules are difficult to simulate theoretically and have proven challenging to detect. Here we report the observation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold collisions between potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K) atoms and sodium-23–potassium-40 (<sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K) molecules in the rovibrational ground state. We prepare the atoms and molecules in various hyperfine levels of their ground states and observe the loss of molecules as a function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>.

The observed atom-molecule Feshbach resonances at ultralow temperatures probe the three-body potential energy surface with exceptional resolution and will help to improve understanding of ultracold collisions.</p>

Observation of chiral zero mode in inhomogeneous three-dimensional Weyl metamaterials
<p>Owing to the chirality of Weyl nodes, the Weyl systems can support one-way chiral zero modes under a strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>, which leads to nonconservation of chiral currents—the so-called chiral anomaly. Although promising for robust transport of optical information, the zero chiral bulk modes have not been observed in photonics. Here we design an inhomogeneous Weyl metamaterial in which a gauge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> is generated for the Weyl nodes by engineering the individual unit cells. We experimentally confirm the presence of the gauge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> and observe the zero-order chiral Landau level with one-way propagation. Without breaking the time-reversal symmetry, our system provides a route for designing an artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> in three-dimensional photonic Weyl systems and may have potential for device applications in photonics.</p>

Chiral Majorana fermion modes in a quantum anomalous Hall insulator–superconductor structure
<p>Majorana fermion is a hypothetical particle that is its own antiparticle. We report transport measurements that suggest the existence of one-dimensional chiral Majorana fermion modes in the hybrid system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film coupled with a superconductor. As the external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> is swept, half-integer quantized conductance plateaus are observed at the locations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ization reversals, giving a distinct signature of the Majorana fermion modes. This transport signature is reproducible over many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> sweeps and appears at different temperatures. This finding may open up an avenue to control Majorana fermions for implementing robust topological quantum computing.</p>

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations

Early Use of N-acetylcysteine With Nitrate Therapy in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Reduces Myocardial Infarct Size (the NACIAM Trial [N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Contemporary ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction management involves primary percutaneous coronary intervention, with ongoing studies focusing on infarct size reduction using ancillary therapies. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant with reactive oxygen species scavenging properties that also potentiates the effects of nitroglycerin and thus represents a potentially beneficial ancillary therapy in primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The NACIAM trial (N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction) examined the effects of NAC on infarct size in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluated the effects of intravenous high-dose NAC (29 g over 2 days) with background low-dose nitroglycerin (7.2 mg over 2 days) on early cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic resonance imaging–assessed infarct size.

High-Sensitive Cardiac Troponin T as an Early Biochemical Signature for Clinical and Subclinical Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although small elevations of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) are associated with incident heart failure (HF) in the general population, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. Evaluating the association of hs-cTnT with replacement fibrosis and progression of structural heart disease before symptoms is fundamental to understanding the potential of this biomarker in a HF prevention strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We measured hs-cTnT at baseline among 4986 participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a cohort initially free of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic resonance imaging was performed at baseline. Repeat cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic resonance was performed 10 years later among 2831 participants who remained free of interim CVD events; of these, 1723 received gadolinium-enhanced cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic resonance for characterization of replacement fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement. Progression of subclinical CVD was defined by 10-year change in left ventricular structure and function. Associations of hs-cTnT with incident HF, CV-related mortality, and coronary heart disease were estimated using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Late gadolinium enhancement for replacement fibrosis was detectable in 6.3% participants without interim CVD events by follow-up cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic resonance. A graded association was observed between higher baseline hs-cTnT categories and late gadolinium enhancement (≥7.42 ng/L versus <limit of detection [<3 ng/L]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–5.94). Higher hs-cTnT was also associated with a greater probability of an increase in LV mass >12% (highest category versus <limit of detection; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–2.07), but not with decline in left ventricular ejection fraction. The risk of incident HF was greater for higher hs-cTnT (≥8.81 ng/L versus <limit of detection; adjusted hazards ratio, 5.59; 95% CI, 2.97–10.68).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>hs-cTnT levels are associated with replacement fibrosis and progressive changes in left ventricular structure in CVD-free adults, findings that may precede HF symptoms by years.

We found that the viscous electron fluid in graphene responds to nonquantizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s by producing an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong></span></strong> opposite to that generated by the ordinary Hall effect. The viscous contribution is substantial and identified by studying local voltages that arise in the vicinity of current-injecting contacts. We analyzed the anomaly over a wide range of temperatures and carrier densities and extracted the Hall viscosity, a dissipationless transport coefficient that was long identified theoretically but remained elusive in experiments.</p>

Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> behaviors in response to directional and nondirectional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic behaviors is well understood, but it is less well understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental programming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

Auxin and ROP GTPase Signaling of Polar Nuclear Migration in Root Epidermal Hair Cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear migration is crucial during the development of diverse eukaryotes. In plants, root hair growth requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear migration into the outgrowing hair. However, knowledge about the dynamics and the regulatory mechanisms underlying nuclear movements in root epidermal cells remains limited. Here, we show that both auxin and Rho-of-Plant (ROP) signaling modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear position at the inner epidermal plasma membrane domain oriented to the cortical cells during cell elongation as well as subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear movement to the outer domain into the emerging hair bulge in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Auxin signaling via the nuclear AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE ACETIC ACID7 pathway ensures correct nuclear placement toward the inner membrane domain. Moreover, precise inner nuclear placement relies on SPIKE1 Rho-GEF, SUPERCENTIPEDE1 Rho-GDI, and ACTIN7 (ACT7) function and to a lesser extent on VTI11 vacuolar SNARE activity. Strikingly, the directionality and/or velocity of outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear migration into the hair outgrowth along actin strands also are ACT7 dependent, auxin sensitive, and regulated by ROP signaling. Thus, our findings provide a founding framework revealing auxin and ROP signaling of inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear position with some contribution by vacuolar morphology and of actin-dependent outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear migration in root epidermal hair cells.</p>

A MicroRNA93–Interferon Regulatory Factor-9–Immunoresponsive Gene-1–Itaconic Acid Pathway Modulates M2-Like Macrophage Polarization to Revascularize Ischemic Muscle
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Currently, no therapies exist for treating and improving outcomes in patients with severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). MicroRNA93 (miR93) has been shown to favorably modulate angiogenesis and to reduce tissue loss in genetic PAD models. However, the cell-specific function, downstream mechanisms, or signaling involved in miR93-mediated ischemic muscle neovascularization is not clear. Macrophages were best known to modulate arteriogenic response in PAD, and the extent of arteriogenic response induced by macrophages is dependent on greater M2 to M1 activation/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization state. In the present study, we identified a novel mechanism by which miR93 regulates macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization to promote angiogenesis and arteriogenesis to revascularize ischemic muscle in experimental PAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro (macrophages, endothelial cells, skeletal muscle cells under normal and hypoxia serum starvation conditions) and in vivo experiments in preclinical PAD models (unilateral femoral artery ligation and resection) were conducted to examine the role of miR93-interferon regulatory factor-9–immunoresponsive gene-1 (IRG1)–itaconic acid pathway in macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization, angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vivo, compared with wild-type controls, miR106b-93-25 cluster–deficient mice (miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup>) showed decreased angiogenesis and arteriogenesis correlating with increased M1-like macrophages after experimental PAD. Intramuscular delivery of miR93 in miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> PAD mice increased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and the extent of perfusion, which correlated with more M2-like macrophages in the proximal and distal hind-limb muscles. In vitro, miR93 promotes and sustains M2-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization even under M1-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>izing conditions (hypoxia serum starvation). Delivery of bone marrow–derived macrophages from miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> to wild-type ischemic muscle decreased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion, whereas transfer of wild-type macrophages to miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> had the opposite effect. Systematic analysis of top differentially upregulated genes from RNA sequencing between miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type ischemic muscle showed that miR93 regulates IRG1 function to modulate itaconic acid production and macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization. The 3′ untranslated region luciferase assays performed to determine whether IRG1 is a direct target of miR93 revealed that IRG1 is not an miR93 target but that interferon regulatory factor-9, which can regulate IRG1 expression, is an miR93 target. In vitro, increased expression of interferon regulatory factor-9 and IRG1 and itaconic acid treatment significantly decreased endothelial angiogenic potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>miR93 inhibits interferon regulatory factor-9 to decrease IRG1–itaconic acid production to induce M2-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization in ischemic muscle to enhance angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery in experimental PAD.</p></sec>

Using a gigahertz superconducting qubit, we observed the quantization of a megahertz radio-frequency resonator, cooled it to the ground state, and stabilized Fock states. Releasing the resonator from our control, we observed its rethermalization with nanosecond resolution. Extending circuit quantum electrodynamics to the megahertz regime, we have enabled the exploration of thermodynamics at the quantum scale and allowed interfacing quantum circuits with megahertz systems such as spin systems or macroscopic mechanical oscillators.</p>

A valley valve and electron beam splitter
<p>Developing alternative paradigms of electronics beyond silicon technology requires the exploration of fundamentally new physical mechanisms, such as the valley-specific phenomena in hexagonal two-dimensional materials. We realize ballistic valley Hall kink states in bilayer graphene and demonstrate gate-controlled current transmission in a four-kink router device. The operations of a waveguide, a valve, and a tunable electron beam splitter are demonstrated. The valley valve exploits the valley-momentum locking of the kink states and reaches an on/off ratio of 8 at zero <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>.

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators

Instead, nonlocal string order parameters can be employed to reveal their hidden order. Similar diluted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of spin-charge separation.

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices

An on/off Berry phase switch in circular graphene resonators
<p>The phase of a quantum state may not return to its original value after the system’s parameters cycle around a closed path; instead, the wave function may acquire a measurable phase difference called the Berry phase.

Here, we demonstrate an unusual Berry phase–induced spectroscopic feature: a sudden and large increase in the energy of angular-momentum states in circular graphene p-n junction resonators when a relatively small critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> is reached.

Polar Localization of the Borate Exporter BOR1 Requires AP2-Dependent Endocytosis
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element in plants but is toxic when it accumulates to high levels. In root cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the borate exporter BOR1 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ly localized in the plasma membrane toward the stele side for directional transport of B. Upon high-B supply, BOR1 is rapidly internalized and degraded in the vacuole. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization and B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 are mediated by endocytosis from the plasma membrane. To dissect the endocytic pathways mediating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization and vacuolar sorting, we investigated the contribution of the clathrin adaptor protein, ADAPTOR PROTEIN2 (AP2) complex, to BOR1 trafficking. In the mutants lacking µ- or σ-subunits of the AP2 complex, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization and constitutive endocytosis of BOR1 under low-B conditions were dramatically disturbed. A coimmunoprecipitation assay showed association of the AP2 complex with BOR1, while it was independent of YxxΦ sorting motifs, which are in a cytosolic loop of BOR1. A yeast two-hybrid assay supported the interaction of the AP2 complex µ-subunit with the C-terminal tail but not with the YxxΦ motifs in the cytosolic loop of BOR1. Intriguingly, lack of the AP2 subunit did not affect the B-induced rapid internalization/vacuolar sorting of BOR1. Consistent with defects in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization, the AP2 complex mutants showed hypersensitivity to B deficiency. Our results indicate that AP2-dependent endocytosis maintains the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization of BOR1 to support plant growth under low-B conditions, whereas the B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 is mediated through an AP2-independent endocytic pathway.</p>

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in angiosperms, rapid tip growth in pollen tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton within the pollen tube plays a crucial role in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized process. However, the mechanism underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in pollen tube growth remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-organizing protein, Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls pollen tube growth by modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity and distribution of the F-actin array. The rice <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal pollen tube growth and a decreased germination rate of the pollen grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> pollen tubes display a disorganized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity during tip growth. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the rice pollen tube, which is essential for pollen tube growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity as well as F-actin organization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during rice pollen tube growth. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of pollen tube growth via modulating F-actin organization and array orientation in rice. This work provides insights into tip-focused cell growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity.</p>

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator

The resistivity of YbB<sub>12</sub>, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in metals, exhibits distinct quantum oscillations.

Local transformations of the hippocampal cognitive map

The grid remained primarily anchored to the unchanged stable walls and showed a nonuniform rescaling.

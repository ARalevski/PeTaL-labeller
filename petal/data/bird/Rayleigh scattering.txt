Intense threat switches dorsal raphe serotonin neurons to a paradoxical operational mode
<p>Survival depends on the selection of behaviors adaptive for the current environment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sky</span></strong>. Although serotonin has been implicated in adaptive behavior, environmental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that stimulation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat environments but induced escape behavior in high-threat environments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe serotonin neural dynamics inverted in high-threat environments. Stimulation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive environments, and movement-related GABA neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative environments. Thus, dorsal raphe circuits switch between distinct operational modes to promote environment-specific adaptive behaviors.</p>

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience. As explosions pattern the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sky</span></strong>, the visual system must capture information about the time-varying positions, colors, and contrasts of myriad spots of light. This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural circuits that map visual space. To generate this retinotopy (visual mapping), neurons must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved? The molecules that regulate neuronal differentiation have been described in detail, as have the cues that allow differentiated neurons to reach and choose their synaptic partners (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, the mechanisms that coordinate neuronal specification with the development of retinotopic circuit wiring have remained elusive. On page 886 of this issue, Fernandes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that in the visual system of flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), photoreceptors use glial cells as intermediaries to communicate with their neural targets to generate retinotopic circuits.</p>

Integration of celestial compass cues in the central complex of the locust brain
<p><bold>Highlighted Article:</bold> Polarization-sensitive neurons of the locust central complex show azimuth-dependent responses to unpolarized light spots, suggesting that direct sunlight supports the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sky</span></strong> polarization compass in this brain area.</p>

Honeybees use the skyline in orientation
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Honeybees can orient using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sky</span></strong>line, the panoramic silhouette of terrestrial objects against the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sky</span></strong>, an ability probably important to bees in their everyday navigation.</p>

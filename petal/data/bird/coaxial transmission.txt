Genomic and epidemiological monitoring of yellow fever virus transmission potential
<p>The yellow fever virus (YFV) epidemic in Brazil is the largest in decades. The recent discovery of YFV in Brazilian <i>Aedes</i> species mosquitos highlights a need to monitor the risk of reestablishment of urban YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in the Americas. We use a suite of epidemiological, spatial, and genomic approaches to characterize YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. We show that the age and sex distribution of human cases is characteristic of sylvatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Analysis of YFV cases combined with genomes generated locally reveals an early phase of sylvatic YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and spatial expansion toward previously YFV-free areas, followed by a rise in viral spillover to humans in late 2016. Our results establish a framework for monitoring YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in real time that will contribute to a global strategy to eliminate future YFV epidemics.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Social network plasticity decreases disease transmission in a eusocial insect
<p>Animal social networks are shaped by multiple selection pressures, including the need to ensure efficient communication and functioning while simultaneously limiting disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Social animals could potentially further reduce epidemic risk by altering their social networks in the presence of pathogens, yet there is currently no evidence for such pathogen-triggered responses. We tested this hypothesis experimentally in the ant <i>Lasius niger</i> using a combination of automated tracking, controlled pathogen exposure, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion quantification, and temporally explicit simulations. Pathogen exposure induced behavioral changes in both exposed ants and their nestmates, which helped contain the disease by reinforcing key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion-inhibitory properties of the colony’s contact network. This suggests that social network plasticity in response to pathogens is an effective strategy for mitigating the effects of disease in social groups.</p>

Spindle asymmetry drives non-Mendelian chromosome segregation
<p>Genetic elements compete for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion through meiosis, when haploid gametes are created from a diploid parent. Selfish elements can enhance their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion through a process known as meiotic drive. In female meiosis, selfish elements drive by preferentially attaching to the egg side of the spindle. This implies some asymmetry between the two sides of the spindle, but the molecular mechanisms underlying spindle asymmetry are unknown. Here we found that CDC42 signaling from the cell cortex regulated microtubule tyrosination to induce spindle asymmetry and that non-Mendelian segregation depended on this asymmetry. Cortical CDC42 depends on polarization directed by chromosomes, which are positioned near the cortex to allow the asymmetric cell division. Thus, selfish meiotic drivers exploit the asymmetry inherent in female meiosis to bias their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion.</p>

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally transmitted Zika virus has been documented in the United States this year, a reflection of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with efforts to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid spread of the virus through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population immune. This so-called "herd immunity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika virus to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a vaccine against Zika, which caused widespread alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain deformities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the virus while they were pregnant. But with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in the region becoming scarce, it does complicate efforts of clinical trials that hope to show lower rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and disease in vaccinated people.

Essential roles of AMPA receptor GluA1 phosphorylation and presynaptic HCN channels in fast-acting antidepressant responses of ketamine
<p>Although the molecular mechanism is not clear, the clinically tested drug ketamine has rapid antidepressant action that does not require the multiple weeks of treatment needed for other antidepressant drugs to have an effect. We showed that ketamine potentiated Schaffer collateral–CA1 cell excitatory synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in hippocampal slice preparations from rodents and enhanced the phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit on Ser<sup>845</sup> of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor in the hippocampal area CA1. These effects persisted when γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors were pharmacologically blocked. Ketamine reduced behavioral despair in wild-type mice but had no effect in GluA1 S845A knock-in mutant mice. Presynaptic (CA3 pyramidal cell), but not postsynaptic (CA1 pyramidal cell), deletion of <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA)–type glutamate receptors eliminated the ketamine-induced enhancement of excitatory synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in hippocampal slices and the antidepressant actions of ketamine in mice. The synaptic and behavioral actions of ketamine were completely occluded by inhibition or deletion of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated channel 1 (HCN1). Our results implicate presynaptic NMDA receptor inhibition followed by reduced activity of presynaptic HCN1 channels, which would result in an increase in glutamate release and postsynaptic glutamate receptor activity, as a mechanism of ketamine action. These data provide a mechanism for changes in synaptic activity that could explain the fast-acting antidepressant effects of this drug.</p>

Manganese promotes the aggregation and prion-like cell-to-cell exosomal transmission of α-synuclein
<p>The aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn) is considered a key pathophysiological feature of certain neurodegenerative disorders, collectively termed synucleinopathies. Given that a prion-like, cell-to-cell transfer of misfolded αSyn has been recognized in the spreading of αSyn pathology in synucleinopathies, we investigated the biological mechanisms underlying the propagation of the disease with respect to environmental neurotoxic stress. Considering the potential role of the divalent metal manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) in protein aggregation, we characterized its effect on αSyn misfolding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in experimental models of Parkinson’s disease. In cultured dopaminergic neuronal cells stably expressing wild-type human αSyn, misfolded αSyn was secreted through exosomes into the extracellular medium upon Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure. These exosomes were endocytosed through caveolae into primary microglial cells, thereby mounting neuroinflammatory responses. Furthermore, Mn<sup>2+</sup>-elicited exosomes exerted a neurotoxic effect in a human dopaminergic neuronal model (LUHMES cells). Moreover, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis revealed that Mn<sup>2+</sup> accelerated the cell-to-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion of αSyn, resulting in dopaminergic neurotoxicity in a mouse model of Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure. Welders exposed to Mn<sup>2+</sup> had increased misfolded αSyn content in their serum exosomes. Stereotaxically delivering αSyn-containing exosomes, isolated from Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated αSyn-expressing cells, into the striatum initiated Parkinsonian-like pathological features in mice. Together, these results indicate that Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure promotes αSyn secretion in exosomal vesicles, which subsequently evokes proinflammatory and neurodegenerative responses in both cell culture and animal models.</p>

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased activity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion increased neuronal excitability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic excitability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic excitability, reduced GABAergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased activity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF exposure. Activating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA activity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic excitability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated disorders.</p>

Secreted amyloid-β precursor protein functions as a GABA<sub>B</sub>R1a ligand to modulate synaptic transmission
<p>Amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, yet its physiological function remains unresolved. Accumulating evidence suggests that APP has a synaptic function mediated by an unidentified receptor for secreted APP (sAPP). Here we show that the sAPP extension domain directly bound the sushi 1 domain specific to the γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1a (GABA<sub>B</sub>R1a). sAPP-GABA<sub>B</sub>R1a binding suppressed synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and enhanced short-term facilitation in mouse hippocampal synapses via inhibition of synaptic vesicle release. A 17–amino acid peptide corresponding to the GABA<sub>B</sub>R1a binding region within APP suppressed in vivo spontaneous neuronal activity in the hippocampus of anesthetized Thy1-GCaMP6s mice. Our findings identify GABA<sub>B</sub>R1a as a synaptic receptor for sAPP and reveal a physiological role for sAPP in regulating GABA<sub>B</sub>R1a function to modulate synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion.</p>

Transmission modes of the mammalian gut microbiota

Urbanization and humidity shape the intensity of influenza epidemics in U.S. cities
<p>Influenza epidemics vary in intensity from year to year, driven by climatic conditions and by viral antigenic evolution. However, important spatial variation remains unexplained. Here we show predictable differences in influenza incidence among cities, driven by population size and structure. Weekly incidence data from 603 cities in the United States reveal that epidemics in smaller cities are focused on shorter periods of the influenza season, whereas in larger cities, incidence is more diffuse. Base <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion potential estimated from city-level incidence data is positively correlated with population size and with spatiotemporal organization in population density, indicating a milder response to climate forcing in metropolises. This suggests that urban centers incubate critical chains of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion outside of peak climatic conditions, altering the spatiotemporal geometry of herd immunity.</p>

Steep drop in Zika cases undermines vaccine trial
<p>When Zika raced through the Americas in 2016, it caused widespread alarm because the usually mild infection led to brain damage in babies. An intense effort began to develop a Zika vaccine, and in March 2017, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a $110 million trial of its most promising candidate. The trial, now taking place in nine countries in North and South America, has hit a wall: There are too few cases of Zika in the region—largely because vast swaths of populations were infected and now are immune—to assess whether the vaccine works. As a result, researchers are now planning to vaccinate people and then intentionally infect them with the Zika virus. This human challenge model, used for decades with other diseases, was dismissed as too risky by an ethics committee just last year, mainly because infected people can sexually transmit the virus to people who are not in the study. But given the drop in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion, a better understanding about the duration of sexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion, and decreasing interest from industry in Zika vaccine R&D, the human challenge model now looks like the best way to move the field forward.</p>

Is ungulate migration culturally transmitted? Evidence of social learning from translocated animals
<p>Ungulate migrations are assumed to stem from learning and cultural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion of information regarding seasonal distribution of forage, but this hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We compared the migratory propensities of bighorn sheep and moose translocated into novel habitats with those of historical populations that had persisted for hundreds of years. Whereas individuals from historical populations were largely migratory, translocated individuals initially were not. After multiple decades, however, translocated populations gained knowledge about surfing green waves of forage (tracking plant phenology) and increased their propensity to migrate. Our findings indicate that learning and cultural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion are the primary mechanisms by which ungulate migrations evolve. Loss of migration will therefore expunge generations of knowledge about the locations of high-quality forage and likely suppress population abundance.</p>

Cancer mutations and targeted drugs can disrupt dynamic signal encoding by the Ras-Erk pathway
<p>The Ras-Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway encodes information in its dynamics; the duration and frequency of Erk activity can specify distinct cell fates. To enable dynamic encoding, temporal information must be accurately transmitted from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. We used optogenetic profiling to show that both oncogenic B-Raf mutations and B-Raf inhibitors can cause corruption of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion, so that short pulses of input Ras activity are distorted into abnormally long Erk outputs. These changes can reshape downstream transcription and cell fates, resulting in improper decisions to proliferate. These findings illustrate how altered dynamic signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion properties, and not just constitutively increased signaling, can contribute to cell proliferation and perhaps cancer, and how optogenetic profiling can dissect mechanisms of signaling dysfunction in disease.</p>

Inactivation of porcine endogenous retrovirus in pigs using CRISPR-Cas9

Observation of Anderson localization in disordered nanophotonic structures
<p>Anderson localization is an interference effect crucial to the understanding of waves in disordered media. However, localization is expected to become negligible when the features of the disordered structure are much smaller than the wavelength. Here we experimentally demonstrate the localization of light in a disordered dielectric multilayer with an average layer thickness of 15 nanometers, deep into the subwavelength regime. We observe strong disorder-induced reflections that show that the interplay of localization and evanescence can lead to a substantial decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion, or the opposite feature of enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. This deep-subwavelength Anderson localization exhibits extreme sensitivity: Varying the thickness of a single layer by 2 nanometers changes the reflection appreciably.

Dengue diversity across spatial and temporal scales: Local structure and the effect of host population size
<p>A fundamental mystery for dengue and other infectious pathogens is how observed patterns of cases relate to actual chains of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion events. These pathways are intimately tied to the mechanisms by which strains interact and compete across spatial scales. Phylogeographic methods have been used to characterize pathogen dispersal at global and regional scales but have yielded few insights into the local spatiotemporal structure of endemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Using geolocated genotype (800 cases) and serotype (17,291 cases) data, we show that in Bangkok, Thailand, 60% of dengue cases living <200 meters apart come from the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion chain, as opposed to 3% of cases separated by 1 to 5 kilometers. At distances <200 meters from a case (encompassing an average of 1300 people in Bangkok), the effective number of chains is 1.7. This number rises by a factor of 7 for each 10-fold increase in the population of the “enclosed” region. This trend is observed regardless of whether population density or area increases, though increases in density over 7000 people per square kilometer do not lead to additional chains. Within Thailand these chains quickly mix, and by the next dengue season viral lineages are no longer highly spatially structured within the country. In contrast, viral flow to neighboring countries is limited. These findings are consistent with local, density-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and implicate densely populated communities as key sources of viral diversity, with home location the focal point of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion.

Lack of LAG3 substantially delayed α-syn PFF–induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo.

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-loading pathway has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-loading types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. However, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the structure of PD has not been considered, even though it could impact permeability, and functional data are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, structure, and function using data from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was conducted for all relevant cell–cell interfaces in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-loading types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell interfaces in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-loading type. PD density data of single interfaces, even combined with PD diameter and length data, did not correlate with the intercellular diffusion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD substructure not visible on standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results support a proposed passive symplasmic loading mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD structure differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-loading species.</p>

EXO70C2 Is a Key Regulatory Factor for Optimal Tip Growth of Pollen
<p>The exocyst, a eukaryotic tethering complex, coregulates targeted exocytosis as an effector of small GTPases in polarized cell growth. In land plants, several exocyst subunits are encoded by double or triple paralogs, culminating in tens of EXO70 paralogs. Out of 23 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> EXO70 isoforms, we analyzed seven isoforms expressed in pollen. Genetic and microscopic analyses of single mutants in <i>EXO70A2</i>, <i>EXO70C1</i>, <i>EXO70C2</i>, <i>EXO70F1</i>, <i>EXO70H3</i>, <i>EXO70H5</i>, and <i>EXO70H6</i> genes revealed that only a loss-of-function <i>EXO70C2</i> allele resulted in a significant male-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion defect (segregation 40%:51%:9%) due to aberrant pollen tube growth. Mutant pollen tubes grown in vitro exhibited an enhanced growth rate and a decreased thickness of the tip cell wall, causing tip bursts. However, <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes could frequently recover and restart their speedy elongation, resulting in a repetitive stop-and-go growth dynamics. A pollen-specific depletion of the closest paralog, <i>EXO70C1</i>, using artificial microRNA in the <i>exo70C2</i> mutant background, resulted in a complete pollen-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion defect, suggesting redundant functions of EXO70C1 and EXO70C2. Both EXO70C1 and EXO70C2, GFP tagged and expressed under the control of their native promoters, localized in the cytoplasm of pollen grains, pollen tubes, and also root trichoblast cells. The expression of EXO70C2-GFP complemented the aberrant growth of <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes. The absent EXO70C2 interactions with core exocyst subunits in the yeast two-hybrid assay, cytoplasmic localization, and genetic effect suggest an unconventional EXO70 function possibly as a regulator of exocytosis outside the exocyst complex. In conclusion, EXO70C2 is a novel factor contributing to the regulation of optimal tip growth of Arabidopsis pollen tubes.</p>

Phylogenetic Tools for Generalized HIV-1 Epidemics: Findings from the PANGEA-HIV Methods Comparison
<p>Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modeling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ions from individuals in their first 3 months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation > 90%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods’ development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.</p>

Edge Nonlinear Optics on a MoS<sub>2</sub> Atomic Monolayer
<sec><title>Optics On the Edge</title><p>The ability to isolate stable materials just one atom thick has provided the impetus for a new generation of thin films technologies.

Neuronal Activity Promotes Oligodendrogenesis and Adaptive Myelination in the Mammalian Brain

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Visualizing Embolism Propagation in Gas-Injected Leaves
<p>Because the xylem in leaves is thought to be at the greatest risk of cavitation, reliable and efficient methods to characterize leaf xylem vulnerability are of interest. We report a method to generate leaf xylem vulnerability curves (VCs) by gas injection. Using optical light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion, we visualized embolism propagation in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves injected with positive gas pressure. This resulted in a rapid, stepwise reduction of transmitted light, identical to that observed during leaf dehydration, confirming that the optical method detects gas bubbles and provides insights into the air-seeding hypothesis. In red oak, xylem VCs generated using gas injection were similar to those generated using bench dehydration, but indicated 50% loss of conductivity at lower tension (∼0.4 MPa) in grapevine. In determining VC, this method eliminates the need to ascertain xylem tension, thus avoiding potential errors in water potential estimations. It is also much faster (1 h per VC). However, severing the petiole and applying high-pressure gas could affect air-seeding and the generated VC. We discuss potential artifacts arising from gas injection and recommend comparison of this method with a more standard procedure before it is assumed to be suitable for a given species.</p>

Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known plant viruses are spread from plant to plant by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted viruses manipulate the release of plant volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting virus spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on plants infected with these viruses, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and one of its host plants, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, plants infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in plant tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected plants engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Therefore, the frequency of virus acquisition and the virus load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected plants than on CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected plants. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy plants infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced tobacco plants, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of RNAi protein to increase plant ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion by vector insects.</p>

The ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 Complex Mediates Pollen Tube Growth by Coordinating Vacuolar Targeting and Organization
<p>Pollen tube growth is an essential step for successful plant reproduction. Vacuolar trafficking and dynamic organization are important for pollen tube growth; however, the key proteins involved in these processes are not well understood. Here, we report that the ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 (AP-3) complex and its tonoplast cargo PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10) are critical for pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). AP-3 is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of four subunits, δ, β, µ, and σ. AP-3 regulates tonoplast targeting of several cargoes, such as PAT10. We show that functional loss of any of the four AP-3 subunits reduces plant fertility. In <i>ap-3</i> mutants, pollen development was normal but pollen tube growth was compromised, leading to reduced male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Functional loss of <i>PAT10</i> caused a similar reduction in pollen tube growth, suggesting that the tonoplast association of PAT10 mediated by AP-3 is crucial for this process. Indeed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient during pollen tube growth was reduced significantly due to <i>AP-3</i> loss of function, consistent with the abnormal targeting of CALCINUERIN B-LIKE2 (CBL2) and CBL3, whose tonoplast association depends on PAT10. Furthermore, we show that the pollen tubes of <i>ap-3</i> mutants have vacuoles with simplified tubules and bulbous structures, indicating that AP-3 affects vacuolar organization. Our results demonstrate a role for AP-3 in plant reproduction and provide insights into the role of vacuoles in polarized cell growth.</p>

A Putative Protein <i>O</i>-Fucosyltransferase Facilitates Pollen Tube Penetration through the Stigma<i>–</i>Style Interface
<p>During pollen-pistil interactions in angiosperms, the male gametophyte (pollen) germinates to produce a pollen tube. To fertilize ovules located within the female pistil, the pollen tube must physically penetrate specialized tissues. Whereas the process of pollen tube penetration through the pistil has been anatomically well described, the genetic regulation remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gene, <i>O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>AtOFT1</i>), which plays a key role in pollen tube penetration through the stigma-style interface. Semi-in vivo growth assays demonstrate that <i>oft1</i> mutant pollen tubes have a reduced ability to penetrate the stigma-style interface, leading to a nearly 2,000-fold decrease in <i>oft1</i> pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion efficiency and a 5- to 10-fold decreased seed set. We also demonstrate that AtOFT1 is localized to the Golgi apparatus, indicating its potential role in cellular glycosylation events. Finally, we demonstrate that <i>AtOFT1</i> and other similar Arabidopsis genes represent a novel clade of sequences related to metazoan protein <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferases and that mutation of residues that are important for <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferase activity compromises AtOFT1 function in vivo. The results of this study elucidate a physiological function for AtOFT1 in pollen tube penetration through the stigma-style interface and highlight the potential importance of protein <i>O</i>-glycosylation events in pollen-pistil interactions.</p>

LRX Proteins Play a Crucial Role in Pollen Grain and Pollen Tube Cell Wall Development<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Leu-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) are chimeric proteins containing an N-terminal Leu-rich repeat (LRR) and a C-terminal extensin domain. LRXs are involved in cell wall formation in vegetative tissues and required for plant growth. However, the nature of their role in these cellular processes remains to be elucidated. Here, we used a combination of molecular techniques, light microscopy, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron microscopy to characterize mutants of pollen-expressed <i>LRXs</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>). Mutations in multiple pollen-expressed <i>lrx</i> genes cause severe defects in pollen germination and pollen tube growth, resulting in a reduced seed set. Physiological experiments demonstrate that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability partially suppresses the pollen tube growth defects, suggesting that LRX proteins influence Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related processes. Furthermore, we show that LRX protein localizes to the cell wall, and its LRR-domain (which likely mediates protein-protein interactions) is associated with the plasma membrane. Mechanical analyses by cellular force microscopy and finite element method-based modeling revealed significant changes in the material properties of the cell wall and the fine-tuning of cellular biophysical parameters in the mutants compared to the wild type. The results indicate that LRX proteins might play a role in cell wall-plasma membrane communication, influencing cell wall formation and cellular mechanics.</p>

Pollen-Expressed Leucine-Rich Repeat Extensins Are Essential for Pollen Germination and Growth
<p>During pollen tube growth, the walls of the tube provide the mechanical strength resisting turgor pressure to protect two sperm cells. Cell wall proteins may play an important role in this process. Pollen tube cell wall proteins known as leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) harbor a leucine-rich repeat domain and an extensin domain. In this study, the functions of four pollen-expressed LRXs, LRX8, LRX9, LRX10, and LRX11 (LRX8–11), were characterized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>LRX8–11</i> displayed a consistent expression pattern in mature pollen grains and pollen tubes. In a phenotypic analysis of four single mutants, six double mutants, four triple mutants, and a quadruple mutant, the triple and quadruple mutant plants displayed markedly reduced seed set and decreased male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion efficiency accompanied by compromised pollen germination and pollen tube growth. GFP-fused LRX8, LRX10, and LRX11 were found to be localized to pollen tube cell walls. An immunohistochemical analysis of pollen tube cell wall polysaccharides showed an increase in the amount of rhamnogalacturonan I in the subapical walls of pollen tubes of the <i>lrx9 lrx10 lrx11</i> and <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutants and a decrease in the content of fucosylated xyloglucans in <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> compared with wild-type plants. Moreover, the callose content in the apical walls of pollen tubes increased in the <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutant. In conclusion, we propose that LRX8–11 function synergistically to maintain pollen tube cell wall integrity; thus, they play critical roles in pollen germination and pollen tube growth.</p>

SEIPIN Proteins Mediate Lipid Droplet Biogenesis to Promote Pollen Transmission and Reduce Seed Dormancy
<p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous organelles in plant cells, but their physiological roles are largely unknown. To gain insight into the function of LDs in plants, we have characterized the Arabidopsis homologs of SEIPIN proteins, which are crucial factors for LD biogenesis in yeast and animals. <i>SEIPIN1</i> is expressed almost exclusively in embryos, while <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> have broader expression profiles with maximal levels in embryos and pollen, where LDs accumulate most abundantly. Genetic analysis demonstrates that all three <i>SEIPINs</i> contribute to proper LD biogenesis in embryos, whereas in pollen, only <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> play a significant role. The double <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants accumulate extremely enlarged LDs in seeds and pollen, which hinders their subsequent mobilization during germination. Interestingly, electron microscopy analysis reveals the presence of nuclear LDs attached to type I nucleoplasmic reticulum in triple <i>seipin</i> mutant embryos, supporting that SEIPINs are essential for maintaining the correct polarity of LD budding at the nuclear envelope, restricting it to the outer membrane. In pollen, the perturbations in LD biogenesis and turnover are coupled to reduced germination in vitro and with lower fertilization efficiency in vivo. In seeds, germination per se is not affected in <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants, but there is a striking increase in seed dormancy levels. Our findings reveal the relevance of SEIPIN-dependent LD biogenesis in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and in adjusting the timing of seed germination, two key adaptive traits of great importance in agriculture.</p>

Cylindrical Inclusion Protein of Turnip Mosaic Virus Serves as a Docking Point for the Intercellular Movement of Viral Replication Vesicles
<p>Plant viruses move from the initially infected cell to adjacent cells through plasmodesmata (PDs). To do so, viruses encode dedicated protein(s) that facilitate this process. How viral proteins act together to support the intercellular movement of viruses is poorly defined. Here, by using an infection-free intercellular vesicle movement assay, we investigate the action of CI (cylindrical inclusion) and P3N-PIPO (amino-terminal half of P3 fused to Pretty Interesting Potyviridae open reading frame), the two PD-localized potyviral proteins encoded by <i>Turnip mosaic virus</i> (TuMV), in the intercellular movement of the viral replication vesicles. We provide evidence that CI and P3N-PIPO are sufficient to support the PD targeting and intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles induced by 6K2, a viral protein responsible for the generation of replication vesicles. 6K2 interacts with CI but not P3N-PIPO. When this interaction is impaired, the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles is inhibited. Furthermore, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron microscopy, vesicular structures are observed in connection with the cylindrical inclusion bodies at structurally modified PDs in cells coexpressing 6K2, CI, and P3N-PIPO. CI is directed to PDs through its interaction with P3N-PIPO. We hypothesize that CI serves as a docking point for PD targeting and the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles. This work contributes to a better understanding of the roles of different viral proteins in coordinating the intercellular movement of viral replication vesicles.</p>

The <i>TRAF Mediated Gametogenesis Progression</i> (<i>TRAMGaP</i>) Gene Is Required for Megaspore Mother Cell Specification and Gametophyte Development
<p>In plants, the role of TRAF-like proteins with meprin and the TRAF homology (MATH) domain is far from clear. In animals, these proteins serve as adapter molecules to mediate signal transduction from Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor to downstream effector molecules. A seed-sterile mutant with a disrupted TRAF-like gene (<i>At5g26290</i>) exhibiting aberrant gametogenesis led us to investigate the developmental role of this gene in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The mutation was semidominant and resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes with such features as short siliques with fewer ovules, pollen and seed sterility, altered Megaspore Mother Cell (MMC) specification, and delayed programmed cell death in megaspores and the tapetum, features that overlapped those in other well-characterized mutants. Seed sterility and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion frequency of the mutant alleles pointed to a dual role, sporophytic and gametophytic, for the gene on the male side. The mutant also showed altered expression of various genes involved in such cellular and developmental pathways as regulation of transcription, biosynthesis and transport of lipids, hormone-mediated signaling, and gametophyte development. The diverse phenotypes of the mutant and the altered expression of key genes related to gametophyte and seed development could be explained based on the functional similarly between <i>At5g26290</i> and MATH-BTB domain proteins that modulate gene expression through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome system. These results show a novel link between a TRAF-like gene and reproductive development in plants.</p>

Catastrophic Unbalanced Genome Rearrangements Cause Somatic Loss of Berry Color in Grapevine
<p>Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) color somatic variants that can be used to develop new grapevine cultivars occasionally appear associated with deletion events of uncertain origin. To understand the mutational mechanisms generating somatic structural variation in grapevine, we compared the Tempranillo Blanco (TB) white berry somatic variant with its black berry ancestor, Tempranillo Tinto. Whole-genome sequencing uncovered a catastrophic genome rearrangement in TB that caused the hemizygous deletion of 313 genes, including the loss of the functional copy for the <i>MYB</i> transcription factors required for anthocyanin pigmentation in the berry skin. Loss of heterozygosity and decreased copy number delimited interspersed monosomic and disomic regions in the right arm of linkage groups 2 and 5. At least 11 validated clustered breakpoints involving intrachromosomal and interchromosomal translocations between three linkage groups flanked the deleted fragments, which, according to segregation analyses, are phased in a single copy of each of the affected chromosomes. These hallmarks, along with the lack of homology between breakpoint joins and the randomness of the order and orientation of the rearranged fragments, are all consistent with a chromothripsis-like pattern generated after chromosome breakage and illegitimate rejoining. This unbalanced genome reshuffling has additional consequences in reproductive development. In TB, lack of sexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion of rearranged chromosomes associates with low gamete viability, which compromises fruit set and decreases fruit production. Our findings show that catastrophic genome rearrangements arise spontaneously and stabilize during plant somatic growth. These dramatic rearrangements generate new interesting phenotypes that can be selected for the improvement of vegetatively propagated plant species.</p>

Synthesis and Self-Assembly of Cellulose Microfibrils from Reconstituted Cellulose Synthase
<p>Cellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, can be converted to bioethanol and is thus highly studied. In plants, cellulose is produced by cellulose synthase, a processive family-2 glycosyltransferase. In plant cell walls, individual β-1,4-glucan chains polymerized by CesA are assembled into microfibrils that are frequently bundled into macrofibrils. An in vitro system in which cellulose is synthesized and assembled into fibrils would facilitate detailed study of this process. Here, we report the heterologous expression and partial purification of His-tagged CesA5 from <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Immunoblot analysis and mass spectrometry confirmed enrichment of PpCesA5. The recombinant protein was functional when reconstituted into liposomes made from yeast total lipid extract. The functional studies included incorporation of radiolabeled Glc, linkage analysis, and imaging of cellulose microfibril formation using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron microscopy. Several microfibrils were observed either inside or on the outer surface of proteoliposomes, and strikingly, several thinner fibrils formed ordered bundles that either covered the surfaces of proteoliposomes or were spawned from liposome surfaces. We also report this arrangement of fibrils made by proteoliposomes bearing CesA8 from hybrid aspen. These observations describe minimal systems of membrane-reconstituted CesAs that polymerize β-1,4-glucan chains that coalesce to form microfibrils and higher-ordered macrofibrils. How these micro- and macrofibrils relate to those found in primary and secondary plant cell walls is uncertain, but their presence enables further study of the mechanisms that govern the formation and assembly of fibrillar cellulosic structures and cell wall composites during or after the polymerization process controlled by CesA proteins.</p>

Stomatal Closure, Basal Leaf Embolism, and Shedding Protect the Hydraulic Integrity of Grape Stems
<p>The time scale of stomatal closure and xylem cavitation during plant dehydration, as well as the fate of embolized organs, are under debate, largely due to methodological limitations in the evaluation of embolism. While some argue that complete stomatal closure precedes the occurrence of embolism, others believe that the two are contemporaneous processes that are accompanied by daily xylem refilling. Here, we utilize an optical light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion method to continuously monitor xylem cavitation in leaves of dehydrating grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) in concert with stomatal conductance and stem and petiole hydraulic measurements. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to continuously monitor xylem cavitation and flow rates in the stem of an intact vine during 10 d of dehydration. The results showed that complete stomatal closure preceded the appearance of embolism in the leaves and the stem by several days. Basal leaves were more vulnerable to xylem embolism than apical leaves and, once embolized, were shed, thereby preventing further water loss and protecting the hydraulic integrity of younger leaves and the stem. As a result, embolism in the stem was minimal even when drought led to complete leaf shedding. These findings suggest that grapevine avoids xylem embolism rather than tolerates it.</p>

<p>To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind plant growth and leaf senescence in monocot plants, we identified a mutant exhibiting dwarfism and an early-senescence leaf phenotype, termed <i>dwarf and early-senescence leaf1</i> (<i>del1</i>). Histological analysis showed that the abnormal growth was caused by a reduction in cell number. Further investigation revealed that the decline in cell number in <i>del1</i> was affected by the cell cycle. Physiological analysis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron microscopy, and TUNEL assays showed that leaf senescence was triggered by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The <i>DEL1</i> gene was cloned using a map-based approach. It was shown to encode a pectate lyase (PEL) precursor that contains a PelC domain. <i>DEL1</i> contains all the conserved residues of PEL and has strong similarity with plant PelC. <i>DEL1</i> is expressed in all tissues but predominantly in elongating tissues. Functional analysis revealed that mutation of <i>DEL1</i> decreased the total PEL enzymatic activity, increased the degree of methylesterified homogalacturonan, and altered the cell wall composition and structure. In addition, transcriptome assay revealed that a set of cell wall function- and senescence-related gene expression was altered in <i>del1</i> plants. Our research indicates that <i>DEL1</i> is involved in both the maintenance of normal cell division and the induction of leaf senescence. These findings reveal a new molecular mechanism for plant growth and leaf senescence mediated by <i>PECTATE LYASE-LIKE</i> genes.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The adhesion of plant cells is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between cell wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant cells are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border cells are examples of this. Border cells (in some species known as border-like cells) provide an expendable barrier between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized cell separation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex cellular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip cell walls. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of cell wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of cell wall components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified multiple novel modes of cell wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border cells. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border cell maturation and enable us to develop a model of the separation process. We propose that loss of adhesion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of cell curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

Function of the Plant DNA Polymerase Epsilon in Replicative Stress Sensing, a Genetic Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Faithful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion of the genetic information is essential in all living organisms. DNA replication is therefore a critical step of cell proliferation, because of the potential occurrence of replication errors or DNA damage when progression of a replication fork is hampered causing replicative stress. Like other types of DNA damage, replicative stress activates the DNA damage response, a signaling cascade allowing cell cycle arrest and repair of lesions. The replicative DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) was shown to activate the S-phase checkpoint in yeast in response to replicative stress, but whether this mechanism functions in multicellular eukaryotes remains unclear. Here, we explored the genetic interaction between Pol ε and the main elements of the DNA damage response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that mutations affecting the polymerase domain of Pol ε trigger ATR-dependent signaling leading to SOG1 activation, WEE1-dependent cell cycle inhibition, and tolerance to replicative stress induced by hydroxyurea, but result in enhanced sensitivity to a wide range of DNA damaging agents. Using knock-down lines, we also provide evidence for the direct role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing. Together, our results demonstrate that the role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing is conserved in plants, and provide, to our knowledge, the first genetic dissection of the downstream signaling events in a multicellular eukaryote.</p>

Connecting the Molecular Structure of Cutin to Ultrastructure and Physical Properties of the Cuticle in Petals of Arabidopsis
<p>The plant cuticle is laid down at the cell wall surface of epidermal cells in a wide variety of structures, but the functional significance of this architectural diversity is not yet understood. Here, the structure-function relationship of the petal cuticle of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was investigated. Applying Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, the cutin mutants <i>long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetase2</i> (<i>lacs2</i>), <i>permeable cuticle1 (pec1)</i>, <i>cyp77a6</i>, <i>glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase6</i> (<i>gpat6</i>), and <i>defective in cuticular ridges</i> (<i>dcr</i>) were grouped in three separate classes based on quantitative differences in the ν(C=O) and ν(C-H) band vibrations. These were associated mainly with the quantity of 10,16-dihydroxy hexadecanoic acid, a monomer of the cuticle polyester, cutin. These spectral features were linked to three different types of cuticle organization: a normal cuticle with nanoridges (<i>lacs2</i> and <i>pec1</i> mutants); a broad translucent cuticle (<i>cyp77a6</i> and <i>dcr</i> mutants); and an electron-opaque multilayered cuticle (<i>gpat6</i> mutant). The latter two types did not have typical nanoridges. Transmission electron microscopy revealed considerable variations in cuticle thickness in the <i>dcr</i> mutant. Different double mutant combinations showed that a low amount of C16 monomers in cutin leads to the appearance of an electron-translucent layer adjacent to the cuticle proper, which is independent of DCR action. We concluded that DCR is not only essential for incorporating 10,16-dihydroxy C16:0 into cutin but also plays a crucial role in the organization of the cuticle, independent of cutin composition. Further characterization of the mutant petals suggested that nanoridge formation and conical cell shape may contribute to the reduction of physical adhesion forces between petals and other floral organs during floral development.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Two Membrane-Anchored Aspartic Proteases Contribute to Pollen and Ovule Development
<p>Aspartic proteases are a class of proteolytic enzymes with conserved aspartate residues, which are implicated in protein processing, maturation, and degradation. Compared with yeast and animals, plants possess a larger aspartic protease family. However, little is known about most of these enzymes. Here, we characterized two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored aspartic protease genes, <i>A36</i> and <i>A39</i>, which are highly expressed in pollen and pollen tubes. <i>a36</i> and <i>a36 a39</i> mutants display significantly reduced pollen activity. Transmission electron microscopy and terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assays further revealed that the unviable pollen in <i>a36 a39</i> may undergo unanticipated apoptosis-like programmed cell death. The degeneration of female gametes also occurred in <i>a36 a39</i>. Aniline Blue staining, scanning electron microscopy, and semi in vitro guidance assays indicated that the micropylar guidance of pollen tubes is significantly compromised in <i>a36 a39</i>. A36 and A39 that were fused with green fluorescent protein are localized to the plasma membrane and display punctate cytosolic localization and colocalize with the GPI-anchored protein COBRA-LIKE10. Furthermore, in <i>a36 a39</i>, the abundance of highly methylesterified homogalacturonans and xyloglucans was increased significantly in the apical pollen tube wall. These results indicate that A36 and A39, two putative GPI-anchored aspartic proteases, play important roles in plant reproduction in Arabidopsis.</p>

Transcriptome and Degradome Sequencing Reveals Dormancy Mechanisms of <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> Seeds<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Seeds with physiological dormancy usually experience primary and secondary dormancy in the nature; however, little is known about the differential regulation of primary and secondary dormancy. We combined multiple approaches to investigate cytological changes, hormonal levels, and gene expression dynamics in <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> seeds during primary dormancy release and secondary dormancy induction. Light microscopy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron microscopy revealed that protein bodies in the embryo cells coalesced during primary dormancy release and then separated during secondary dormancy induction. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that expression of genes negatively regulating gibberellic acid (GA) sensitivity reduced specifically during primary dormancy release, whereas the expression of genes positively regulating abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis increased during secondary dormancy induction. Parallel analysis of RNA ends revealed uncapped transcripts for ∼55% of all unigenes. A negative correlation between fold changes in expression levels of uncapped versus capped mRNAs was observed during primary dormancy release. However, this correlation was loose during secondary dormancy induction. Our analyses suggest that the reversible changes in cytology and gene expression during dormancy release and induction are related to ABA/GA balance. Moreover, mRNA degradation functions as a critical posttranscriptional regulator during primary dormancy release. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding physiological dormancy in seeds.</p>

Phloem Transport of the Receptor DWARF14 Protein Is Required for Full Function of Strigolactones<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The cell-to-cell transport of signaling molecules is essential for multicellular organisms to coordinate the action of their cells. Recent studies identified DWARF14 (D14) as a receptor of strigolactones (SLs), molecules that act as plant hormones and inhibit shoot branching. Here, we demonstrate that <i>RAMOSUS3</i>, a pea ortholog of <i>D14</i>, works as a graft-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ible signal to suppress shoot branching. In addition, we show that D14 protein is contained in phloem sap and transported through the phloem to axillary buds in rice. SLs are not required for the transport of D14 protein. Disruption of D14 transport weakens the suppression of axillary bud outgrowth of rice. Taken together, we conclude that the D14 protein works as an intercellular signaling molecule to fine-tune SL function. Our findings provide evidence that the intercellular transport of a receptor can regulate the action of plant hormones.</p>

Secretory COPII Protein SEC31B Is Required for Pollen Wall Development
<p>The pollen wall protects pollen grains from abiotic and biotic stresses. During pollen wall development, tapetal cells play a vital role by secreting proteins, signals, and pollen wall material to ensure microspore development. But the regulatory mechanism underlying the secretory pathway of the tapetum is largely unknown. Here, we characterize the essential role of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) COPII protein SECRETORY31B (SEC31B) in pollen wall development and the secretory activity of tapetal cells. The sporophyte-controlled <i>atsec31b</i> mutant exhibits severe pollen and seed abortion. Transmission electron microscopy observation indicates that pollen exine formation in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant is disrupted significantly. AtSEC31B is a functional COPII protein revealed by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit site localization, interaction with AtSEC13A, and retarded ER-Golgi protein trafficking in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant. A genetic tapetum-specific rescue assay indicates that AtSEC31B functions primarily in the tapetum. Moreover, deletion of AtSEC31B interrupted the formation of the ER-derived tapetosome and altered the location of the ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER9 protein in the tapetum. Therefore, this work demonstrates that AtSEC31B plays a vital role in pollen wall development by regulating the secretory pathway of the tapetal cells.</p>

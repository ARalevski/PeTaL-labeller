Plastic waste associated with disease on coral reefs
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste can promote microbial colonization by pathogens implicated in outbreaks of disease in the ocean. We assessed the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste on disease risk in 124,000 reef-building corals from 159 reefs in the Asia-Pacific region. The likelihood of disease increases from 4% to 89% when corals are in contact with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be affected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>, suggesting that microhabitats for reef-associated organisms and valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> levels on coral reefs correspond to estimates of terrestrial mismanaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste entering the ocean. We estimate that 11.1 billion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> items are entangled on coral reefs across the Asia-Pacific and project this number to increase 40% by 2025. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste management is critical for reducing diseases that threaten ecosystem health and human livelihoods.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

A unique type of GSK-3 inhibitor brings new opportunities to the clinic
<p>Development of protein kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s is a focus of many drug discovery programs. A major problem, however, is the limited specificity of the commonly used adenosine triphosphate–competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s and the weak inhibition of the more selective substrate-competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Glycogen synthase kinase–3 (GSK-3) is a promising drug target for treating neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but most GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have not reached the clinic. We describe a new type of GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>, L807mts, that acts through a substrate-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> conversion mechanism that occurs within the catalytic site of the enzyme. We determined that L807mts was a potent and highly selective GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> with reasonable pharmacological and safety properties when tested in rodents. Treatment with L807mts enhanced the clearance of β-amyloid loads, reduced inflammation, enhanced autophagic flux, and improved cognitive and social skills in the 5XFAD AD mouse model. This new modality of GSK-3 inhibition may be therapeutic in patients with AD or other central nervous system disorders associated with dysregulated GSK-3.</p>

Androgen receptor inhibitor–induced “BRCAness” and PARP inhibition are synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer
<p>Cancers with loss-of-function mutations in <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> are deficient in the DNA damage repair pathway called homologous recombination (HR), rendering these cancers exquisitely vulnerable to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. This functional state and therapeutic sensitivity is referred to as “BRCAness” and is most commonly associated with some breast cancer types. Pharmaceutical induction of BRCAness could expand the use of PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s to other tumor types. For example, <i>BRCA</i> mutations are present in only ~20% of prostate cancer patients. We found that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells showed increased expression of a set of HR-associated genes, including <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>RAD54L</i>, and <i>RMI2</i>. Although androgen-targeted therapy is typically not effective in CRPC patients, the androgen receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> enzalutamide suppressed the expression of those HR genes in CRPC cells, thus creating HR deficiency and BRCAness. A “lead-in” treatment strategy, in which enzalutamide was followed by the PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> olaparib, promoted DNA damage–induced cell death and inhibited clonal proliferation of prostate cancer cells in culture and suppressed the growth of prostate cancer xenografts in mice. Thus, antiandrogen and PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> combination therapy may be effective for CRPC patients and suggests that pharmaceutically inducing BRCAness may expand the clinical use of PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s.</p>

<i>Rb1</i> and <i>Trp53</i> cooperate to suppress prostate cancer lineage plasticity, metastasis, and antiandrogen resistance
<p>Prostate cancer relapsing from antiandrogen therapies can exhibit variant histology with altered lineage marker expression, suggesting that lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity facilitates therapeutic resistance. The mechanisms underlying prostate cancer lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity are incompletely understood. Studying mouse models, we demonstrate that <i>Rb1</i> loss facilitates lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity and metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma initiated by <i>Pten</i> mutation. Additional loss of <i>Trp53</i> causes resistance to antiandrogen therapy. Gene expression profiling indicates that mouse tumors resemble human prostate cancer neuroendocrine variants; both mouse and human tumors exhibit increased expression of epigenetic reprogramming factors such as Ezh2 and Sox2. Clinically relevant Ezh2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s restore androgen receptor expression and sensitivity to antiandrogen therapy. These findings uncover genetic mutations that enable prostate cancer progression; identify mouse models for studying prostate cancer lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity; and suggest an epigenetic approach for extending clinical responses to antiandrogen therapy.</p>

Targeting NOTCH activation in small cell lung cancer through LSD1 inhibition
<p>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant, aggressive neuroendocrine-type cancer for which little change to first-line standard-of-care treatment has occurred within the last few decades. Unlike nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SCLC harbors few actionable mutations for therapeutic intervention. Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1 also known as KDM1A) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s were previously shown to have selective activity in SCLC models, but the underlying mechanism was elusive. Here, we found that exposure to the selective LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> ORY-1001 activated the NOTCH pathway, resulting in the suppression of the transcription factor ASCL1 and the repression of SCLC tumorigenesis. Our analyses revealed that LSD1 bound to the <i>NOTCH1</i> locus, thereby suppressing NOTCH1 expression and downstream signaling. Reactivation of NOTCH signaling with the LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> reduced the expression of ASCL1 and neuroendocrine cell lineage genes. Knockdown studies confirmed the pharmacological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>-based results. In vivo, sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition in SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models correlated with the extent of consequential NOTCH pathway activation and repression of a neuroendocrine phenotype. Complete and durable tumor regression occurred with ORY-1001–induced NOTCH activation in a chemoresistant PDX model. Our findings reveal how LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s function in this tumor and support their potential as a new and targeted therapy for SCLC.</p>

Skp2-dependent reactivation of AKT drives resistance to PI3K inhibitors
<p>The PI3K-AKT kinase signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers, particularly breast cancer, where amplification and somatic mutations of <i>PIK3CA</i> occur with high frequency in patients. Numerous small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s targeting both PI3K and AKT are under clinical evaluation, but dose-limiting toxicities and the emergence of resistance limit therapeutic efficacy. Various resistance mechanisms to PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have been identified, including de novo mutations, feedback activation of AKT, or cross-talk pathways. We found a previously unknown resistance mechanism to PI3K pathway inhibition that results in AKT rebound activation. In a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, treatment with a PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> or depletion of <i>PIK3CA</i> expression ultimately promoted AKT reactivation in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2, the kinases IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and the cell growth and metabolism-regulating complex mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2), but was independent of PI3K activity or PIP<sub>3</sub> production. Resistance to PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s correlated with the increased abundance of Skp2, ubiquitylation of AKT, cell proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. These findings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> resistance may emerge in aggressive breast cancer cells.</p>

The Tomato Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase SlMPK1 Is as a Negative Regulator of the High-Temperature Stress Response
<p>High-temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits plant growth and development. MAPK cascades play key roles in plant growth and stress signaling, but their involvement in the HT stress response is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 47-kD MBP-phosphorylated protein (p47-MBPK) activated in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves under HT and identify it as SlMPK1 by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of <i>SlMPK1</i> in transgenic tomato plants resulted in enhanced tolerance to HT, while overexpression resulted in reduced tolerance. Proteomic analysis identified a set of proteins involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant defense that are significantly more abundant in RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants than nontransgenic plants under HT stress. RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants also showed changes in membrane lipid peroxidation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant enzyme activities. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a serine-proline-rich protein homolog, SlSPRH1, which interacts with SlMPK1 in yeast, in plant cells, and in vitro. We demonstrate that SlMPK1 can directly phosphorylate SlSPRH1. Furthermore, the serine residue serine-44 of SlSPRH1 is a crucial phosphorylation site in the SlMPK1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant defense mechanism activated during HT stress. We also demonstrate that heterologous expression of <i>SlSPRH1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) led to a decrease in thermotolerance and lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that SlMPK1 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance in tomato plants. SlMPK1 acts by regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant defense, and its substrate SlSPRH1 is involved in this pathway.</p>

Developmental phosphoproteomics identifies the kinase CK2 as a driver of Hedgehog signaling and a therapeutic target in medulloblastoma
<p>A major limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of drug resistance, which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the drug target or through intrinsic resistance of subpopulations of tumor cells. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain tumor, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and drug-resistant. To find new drug targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to common resistance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins commonly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB tumors that were resistant to currently available Hh <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, thereby extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this drug may avoid at least one common mode of acquired resistance. These findings suggest that CK2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.</p>

Inflammatory but not mitogenic contexts prime synovial fibroblasts for compensatory signaling responses to p38 inhibition
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that causes joint pain, swelling, and loss of function. Development of effective new drugs has proven challenging in part because of the complexities and interconnected nature of intracellular signaling networks that complicate the effects of pharmacological interventions. We characterized the kinase signaling pathways that are activated in RA and evaluated the multivariate effects of targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Synovial fluids from RA patients activated the kinase signaling pathways JAK, JNK, p38, and MEK in synovial fibroblasts (SFs), a stromal cell type that promotes RA progression. Kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s enhanced signaling of “off-target” pathways in a manner dependent on stimulatory context. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of p38, which have been widely explored in clinical trials for RA, resulted in undesirable increases in nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JNK, and MEK signaling in SFs in inflammatory, but not mitogenic, contexts. This was mediated by the transcription factor CREB, which functions in part within a negative feedback loop in MAPK signaling. CREB activation was induced predominately by p38 in response to inflammatory stimuli, but by MEK in response to mitogenic stimuli; hence, the effects of drugs targeting p38 or MEK were markedly different in SFs cultured under mitogenic or inflammatory conditions. Together, these findings illustrate how stimulatory context can alter dominance in pathway cross-talk even for a fixed network topology, thereby providing a rationale for why p38 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s deliver limited benefits in RA and demonstrating the need for careful consideration of p38-targeted drugs in inflammation-related disorders.</p>

MEK inhibitor trametinib does not prevent the growth of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)–addicted neuroblastomas
<p>Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is implicated in driving the initiation and progression of multiple cancers. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s targeting the RAS-MAPK pathway are clinically approved as single- or polyagent therapies for patients with specific types of cancer. One example is the MEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> trametinib, which is included as a rational polytherapy strategy for treating EML4-ALK–positive, EGFR-activated, or KRAS-mutant lung cancers and neuroblastomas that also contain activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, in neuroblastoma, a heterogeneous disease, relapse cases display an increased rate of mutations in <i>ALK</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, and <i>NF1</i>, leading to increased activation of RAS-MAPK signaling. Co-targeting ALK and the RAS-MAPK pathway is an attractive option, because monotherapies have not yet produced effective results in ALK-addicted neuroblastoma patients. We evaluated the response of neuroblastoma cell lines to MEK-ERK pathway inhibition by trametinib. In contrast to RAS-MAPK pathway-mutated neuroblastoma cell lines, ALK-addicted neuroblastoma cells treated with trametinib showed increased activation (inferred by phosphorylation) of the kinases AKT and ERK5. This feedback response was mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2–associated protein SIN1, resulting in increased survival and proliferation that depended on AKT signaling. In xenografts in mice, trametinib inhibited the growth of EML4-ALK–positive non–small cell lung cancer and RAS-mutant neuroblastoma but not ALK-addicted neuroblastoma. Thus, our results advise against the seemingly rational option of using MEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s to treat ALK-addicted neuroblastoma.</p>

Differential abundance of CK1α provides selectivity for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-dependent tumors
<p>Constitutive WNT activity drives the growth of various human tumors, including nearly all colorectal cancers (CRCs). Despite this prominence in cancer, no WNT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> is currently approved for use in the clinic largely due to the small number of druggable signaling components in the WNT pathway and the substantial toxicity to normal gastrointestinal tissue. We have shown that pyrvinium, which activates casein kinase 1α (CK1α), is a potent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> of WNT signaling. However, its poor bioavailability limited the ability to test this first-in-class WNT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> in vivo. We characterized a novel small-molecule CK1α activator called SSTC3, which has better pharmacokinetic properties than pyrvinium, and found that it inhibited the growth of CRC xenografts in mice. SSTC3 also attenuated the growth of a patient-derived metastatic CRC xenograft, for which few therapies exist. SSTC3 exhibited minimal gastrointestinal toxicity compared to other classes of WNT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Consistent with this observation, we showed that the abundance of the SSTC3 target, CK1α, was decreased in WNT-driven tumors relative to normal gastrointestinal tissue, and knocking down CK1α increased cellular sensitivity to SSTC3. Thus, we propose that distinct CK1α abundance provides an enhanced therapeutic index for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-driven tumors.</p>

Studies with AC1 knockout mice suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of AC1 may be useful for treating pain and opioid dependence. However, nonselective inhibition of AC isoforms could result in substantial adverse effects.

After demonstrating that the compound (ST034307) inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably transfected with AC1 (HEK-AC1 cells), we confirmed selectivity for AC1 by testing against all isoforms of membrane-bound ACs. ST034307 also inhibited AC1 activity stimulated by forskolin- and Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors in HEK-AC1 cells and showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>y activity in multiple AC1-containing membrane preparations and mouse hippocampal homogenates. ST034307 enhanced μ-opioid receptor (MOR)–mediated inhibition of AC1 in short-term inhibition assays in HEK-AC1 cells stably transfected with MOR; however, the compound blocked heterologous sensitization of AC1 caused by chronic MOR activation in these cells.

Delayed catalyst function enables direct enantioselective conversion of nitriles to NH<sub>2</sub>-amines
<p>Accessing enantiomerically enriched amines often demands oxidation-state adjustments, protection and deprotection processes, and purification procedures that increase cost and waste, limiting applicability.

Here, we show that nitriles, largely viewed as insufficiently reactive, can be transformed directly to multifunctional unprotected homoallylic amines by enantioselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of a carbon-based nucleophile and diastereodivergent reduction of the resulting ketimine. Successful implementation requires that competing copper-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s be present simultaneously and that the slower-forming and less reactive one engages first. This challenge was addressed by incorporation of a nonproductive side cycle, fueled selectively by inexpensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ives, to delay the function of the more active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>. The utility of this approach is highlighted by its application to the efficient preparation of the anticancer agent (+)-tangutorine.</p>

To support the quest for a selective synthesis, we develop a thermodynamic model that relates the tube-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> interfacial energies, temperature, and the resulting tube chirality. We show that nanotubes can grow chiral because of the configurational entropy of their nanometer-sized edge, thus explaining experimentally observed temperature evolutions of chiral distributions. Taking the chemical nature of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> into account through interfacial energies, we derive structural maps and phase diagrams that will guide a rational choice of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> and growth parameters toward a better selectivity.</p>

Locally coordinated synaptic plasticity of visual cortex neurons in vivo
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of cortical responses in vivo involves activity-dependent changes at synapses, but the manner in which different forms of synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity act together to create functional changes in neurons remains unknown. We found that spike timing–induced receptive field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of visual cortex neurons in mice is anchored by increases in the synaptic strength of identified spines. This is accompanied by a decrease in the strength of adjacent spines on a slower time scale. The locally coordinated potentiation and depression of spines involves prominent AMPA receptor redistribution via targeted expression of the immediate early gene product Arc. Hebbian strengthening of activated synapses and heterosynaptic weakening of adjacent synapses thus cooperatively orchestrate cell-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of functional neuronal responses.</p>

Lewis acid enhancement by hydrogen-bond donors for asymmetric catalysis
<p>Small-molecule dual hydrogen-bond (H-bond) donors such as ureas, thioureas, squaramides, and guanidinium ions enjoy widespread use as effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s for promoting a variety of enantioselective reactions. However, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s are only weakly acidic and therefore require highly reactive electrophilic substrates to be effective. We introduce here a mode of catalytic activity with chiral H-bond donors that enables enantioselective reactions of relatively unreactive electrophiles. Squaramides are shown to interact with silyl triflates by binding the triflate counterion to form a stable, yet highly Lewis acidic, complex. The silyl triflate-chiral squaramide combination promotes the generation of oxocarbenium intermediates from acetal substrates at low temperatures. Enantioselectivity in nucleophile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ions to the cationic intermediates is then controlled through a network of noncovalent interactions between the squaramide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> and the oxocarbenium triflate.</p>

Restoring auditory cortex plasticity in adult mice by restricting thalamic adenosine signaling
<p>Circuits in the auditory cortex are highly susceptible to acoustic influences during an early postnatal critical period. The auditory cortex selectively expands neural representations of enriched acoustic stimuli, a process important for human language acquisition. Adults lack this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity. Here we show in the murine auditory cortex that juvenile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity can be reestablished in adulthood if acoustic stimuli are paired with disruption of ecto-5′-nucleotidase–dependent adenosine production or A<sub>1</sub>–adenosine receptor signaling in the auditory thalamus. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity occurs at the level of cortical maps and individual neurons in the auditory cortex of awake adult mice and is associated with long-term improvement of tone-discrimination abilities. We conclude that, in adult mice, disrupting adenosine signaling in the thalamus rejuvenates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity in the auditory cortex and improves auditory perception.</p>

Activity-based protein profiling reveals off-target proteins of the FAAH inhibitor BIA 10-2474
<p>A recent phase 1 trial of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> BIA 10-2474 led to the death of one volunteer and produced mild-to-severe neurological symptoms in four others. Although the cause of the clinical neurotoxicity is unknown, it has been postulated, given the clinical safety profile of other tested FAAH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, that off-target activities of BIA 10-2474 may have played a role. Here we use activity-based proteomic methods to determine the protein interaction landscape of BIA 10-2474 in human cells and tissues. This analysis revealed that the drug inhibits several lipases that are not targeted by PF04457845, a highly selective and clinically tested FAAH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>. BIA 10-2474, but not PF04457845, produced substantial alterations in lipid networks in human cortical neurons, suggesting that promiscuous lipase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have the potential to cause metabolic dysregulation in the nervous system.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Inhibits Auxin-Induced Lateral Rooting Independently of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 Receptor
<p>Plant root systems are indispensable for water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and anchoring plants in the soil. Previous studies using auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s definitively established that auxin plays a central role regulating root growth and development. Most auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s affect all auxin signaling at the same time, which obscures an understanding of individual events. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a lateral root (LR)-preferential auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in a manner that is independent of the JA receptor, CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1). Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with either (−)-JA or (+)-JA reduced primary root length and LR number; the reduction of LR number was also observed in <i>coi1</i> mutants. Treatment of seedlings with (−)-JA or (+)-JA suppressed auxin-inducible genes related to LR formation, diminished accumulation of the auxin reporter <i>DR5::GUS</i>, and inhibited auxin-dependent DII-VENUS degradation. A structural mimic of (−)-JA and (+)-coronafacic acid also inhibited LR formation and stabilized DII-VENUS protein. COI1-independent activity was retained in the double mutant of <i>transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> response1</i> and <i>auxin signaling f-box protein2</i> (<i>tir1 afb2</i>) but reduced in the <i>afb5</i> single mutant. These results reveal JAs and (+)-coronafacic acid to be selective counter-auxins, a finding that could lead to new approaches for studying the mechanisms of LR formation.</p>

Functional Analysis of Short Linear Motifs in the Plant Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor SIAMESE
<p>Endoreplication, a modified cell cycle in which DNA is replicated without subsequent cell division, plays an important but poorly understood role in plant growth and in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SIAMESE</i> (<i>SIM</i>) gene encodes the first identified member of the SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) family of cyclin-dependent kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. <i>SIM</i> controls endoreplication during trichome development, and <i>sim</i> mutant trichomes divide several times instead of endoreplicating their DNA. The SMR family is defined by several short linear amino acid sequence motifs of largely unknown function, and family members have little sequence similarity to any known protein functional domains. Here, we investigated the roles of the conserved motifs in <i>SIM</i> site-directed Arabidopsis mutants using several functional assays. We identified a potential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-binding site, which bears no resemblance to other known CDK interaction motifs. We also identified a potential site of phosphorylation and two redundant nuclear localization sequences. Surprisingly, the only motif with similarity to the other family of plant CDK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>/INTERACTOR OF CDC2 KINASE/KIP-RELATED PROTEIN proteins, is not required for <i>SIM</i> function in vivo. Because even highly divergent members of the <i>SMR</i> family are able to replace <i>SIM</i> function in Arabidopsis trichomes, it is likely that the results obtained here for <i>SIM</i> will apply to other members of this plant-specific family of CDK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of JA biosynthesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under control and water-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with control conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

Mode of action of a <i>Drosophila</i> FMRFamide in inducing muscle contraction
<p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a model system for examining the mechanisms of action of neuropeptides. DPKQDFMRFamide was previously shown to induce contractions in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscle fibres in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The present study examined the possible involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor and second messengers in mediating this myotropic effect after removal of the central nervous system. DPKQDFMRFamide-induced contractions were reduced by 70% and 90%, respectively, in larvae with reduced expression of the <i>Drosophila Fmrf</i> receptor (FR) either ubiquitously or specifically in muscle tissue, compared with the response in control larvae in which expression was not manipulated. No such effect occurred in larvae with reduced expression of this gene only in neurons. The myogenic effects of DPKQDFMRFamide do not appear to be mediated through either of the two <i>Drosophila</i> myosuppressin receptors (<i>DmsR-1</i> and <i>DmsR-2</i>). DPKQDFMRFamide-induced contractions were not reduced in Ala1 transgenic flies lacking activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamKII), and were not affected by the CaMKII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> KN-93. Peptide-induced contractions in the mutants of the phospholipase C-β (<i>PLC</i>β) gene (<i>norpA</i> larvae) and in IP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants were similar to contractions elicited in control larvae. The peptide failed to increase cAMP and cGMP levels in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscles. Peptide-induced contractions were not potentiated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>, and were not antagonized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of cAMP-dependent or cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Additionally, exogenous application of arachidonic acid failed to induce myogenic contractions. Thus, DPKQDFMRFamide induces contractions via a G-protein coupled FMRFamide receptor in muscle cells but does not appear to act via cAMP, cGMP, IP<sub>3</sub>, PLC, CaMKII or arachidonic acid.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Mediterranean Diet Improves High-Density Lipoprotein Function in High-Cardiovascular-Risk Individuals

In the present observational study, the safety and feasibility of transcatheter repair of chronic severe TR with the MitraClip system were evaluated. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the effects on clinical symptoms were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with heart failure symptoms and severe TR on optimal medical treatment were treated with the MitraClip system. Safety, defined as periprocedural adverse events such as death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac tamponade, and feasibility, defined as successful implantation of 1 or more MitraClip devices and reduction of TR by at least 1 grade, were evaluated before discharge and after 30 days. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, functional outcome, defined as changes in New York Heart Assocation class and 6-minute walking distance, were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 64 consecutive patients (mean age 76.6±10 years) deemed unsuitable for surgery who underwent MitraClip treatment for chronic, severe TR for compassionate use. Functional TR was present in 88%; in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, 22 patients were also treated with the MitraClip system for mitral regurgitation as a combined procedure. The degree of TR was severe or massive in 88% of patients before the procedure. The MitraClip device was successfully implanted in the tricuspid valve in 97% of the cases. After the procedure, TR was reduced by at least 1 grade in 91% of the patients, thereof 4% that were reduced from massive to severe. In 13% of patients, TR remained severe after the procedure. Significant reductions in effective regurgitant orifice area (0.9±0.3cm<sup>2</sup> versus 0.4±0.2cm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.001), vena contracta width (1.1±0.5 cm versus 0.6±0.3 cm; <i>P</i>=0.001), and regurgitant volume (57.2±12.8 mL/beat versus 30.8±6.9 mL/beat; <i>P</i><0.001) were observed. No intraprocedural deaths, cardiac tamponade, emergency surgery, stroke, myocardial infarction, or major vascular complications occurred. Three (5%) in-hospital deaths occurred. New York Heart Association class was significantly improved (<i>P</i><0.001), and 6-minute walking distance increased significantly (165.9±102.5 m versus 193.5±115.9 m; <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Transcatheter treatment of TR with the MitraClip system seems to be safe and feasible in this cohort of preselected patients. Initial efficacy analysis showed encouraging reduction of TR, which may potentially result in improved clinical outcomes.</p></sec>

Medical Therapy for Secondary Prevention and Long-Term Outcome in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 5% to 10% of all patients with myocardial infarction. Clinical trials of secondary prevention treatment in MINOCA patients are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between treatment with statins, renin-angiotensin system blockers, β-blockers, dual antiplatelet therapy, and long-term cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This is an observational study of MINOCA patients recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) between July 2003 and June 2013 and followed until December 2013 for outcome events in the Swedish Cause of Death Register and National Patient Register. Of 199 162 myocardial infarction admissions, 9466 consecutive unique patients with MINOCA were identified. Among those, the 9136 patients surviving the first 30 days after discharge constituted the study population. Mean age was 65.3 years, and 61% were women. No patient was lost to follow-up. A stratified propensity score analysis was performed to match treated and untreated groups. The association between treatment and outcome was estimated by comparing between treated and untreated groups by using Cox proportional hazards models. The exposures were treatment at discharge with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events defined as all-cause mortality, hospitalization for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At discharge, 84.5%, 64.1%, 83.4%, and 66.4% of the patients were on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively. During the follow-up of a mean of 4.1 years, 2183 (23.9%) patients experienced a major adverse cardiac event. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for major adverse cardiac events were 0.77 (0.68–0.87), 0.82 (0.73–0.93), and 0.86 (0.74–1.01) in patients on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers, and β-blockers, respectively. For patients on dual antiplatelet therapy followed for 1 year, the hazard ratio was 0.90 (0.74–1.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The results indicate long-term beneficial effects of treatment with statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers on outcome in patients with MINOCA, a trend toward a positive effect of β-blocker treatment, and a neutral effect of dual antiplatelet therapy. Properly powered randomized clinical trials to confirm these results are warranted.</p></sec>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p>Metals that are active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s for methane (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–melting temperature metals (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten metal alloy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s for pyrolysis of methane into hydrogen and carbon. All solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s previously used for this reaction have been deactivated by carbon deposition. In the molten alloy system, the insoluble carbon floats to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi alloy achieved 95% methane conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure hydrogen without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products. Calculations show that the active metals in the molten alloys are atomically dispersed and negatively charged. There is a correlation between the amount of charge on the atoms and their catalytic activity.</p>

MOF-derived cobalt nanoparticles catalyze a general synthesis of amines
<p>The development of base metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds remains an important goal of chemical research. Here, we report that cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated by a graphitic shell are broadly effective reductive amination <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s. Their convenient and practical preparation entailed template assembly of cobalt-diamine-dicarboxylic acid metal organic frameworks on carbon and subsequent pyrolysis under inert atmosphere. The resulting stable and reusable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s were active for synthesis of primary, secondary, tertiary, and <i>N</i>-methylamines (more than 140 examples). The reaction couples easily accessible carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) with ammonia, amines, or nitro compounds, and molecular hydrogen under industrially viable and scalable conditions, offering cost-effective access to numerous amines, amino acid derivatives, and more complex drug targets.</p>

Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity underlies CA1 place fields
<p>Learning is primarily mediated by activity-dependent modifications of synaptic strength within neuronal circuits. We discovered that place fields in hippocampal area CA1 are produced by a synaptic potentiation notably different from Hebbian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity. Place fields could be produced in vivo in a single trial by potentiation of input that arrived seconds before and after complex spiking. The potentiated synaptic input was not initially coincident with action potentials or depolarization. This rule, named behavioral time scale synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity, abruptly modifies inputs that were neither causal nor close in time to postsynaptic activation. In slices, five pairings of subthreshold presynaptic activity and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) plateau potentials produced a large potentiation with an asymmetric seconds-long time course. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity efficiently stores entire behavioral sequences within synaptic weights to produce predictive place cell activity.</p>

Click chemistry enables preclinical evaluation of targeted epigenetic therapies
<p>The success of new therapies hinges on our ability to understand their molecular and cellular mechanisms of action. We modified BET bromodomain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, an epigenetic-based therapy, to create functionally conserved compounds that are amenable to click chemistry and can be used as molecular probes in vitro and in vivo. We used click proteomics and click sequencing to explore the gene regulatory function of BRD4 (bromodomain containing protein 4) and the transcriptional changes induced by BET <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. In our studies of mouse models of acute leukemia, we used high-resolution microscopy and flow cytometry to highlight the heterogeneity of drug activity within tumor cells located in different tissue compartments. We also demonstrate the differential distribution and effects of BET <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s in normal and malignant cells in vivo. This study provides a potential framework for the preclinical assessment of a wide range of drugs.</p>

Active sites for CO<sub>2</sub> hydrogenation to methanol on Cu/ZnO catalysts
<p>The active sites over commercial copper/zinc oxide/aluminum oxide (Cu/ZnO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) hydrogenation to methanol, the Zn-Cu bimetallic sites or ZnO-Cu interfacial sites, have recently been the subject of intense debate. We report a direct comparison between the activity of ZnCu and ZnO/Cu model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s for methanol synthesis. By combining x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, density functional theory, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we can identify and characterize the reactivity of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>. Both experimental and theoretical results agree that ZnCu undergoes surface oxidation under the reaction conditions so that surface Zn transforms into ZnO and allows ZnCu to reach the activity of ZnO/Cu with the same Zn coverage. Our results highlight a synergy of Cu and ZnO at the interface that facilitates methanol synthesis via formate intermediates.</p>

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional metals become harder with decreasing grain sizes, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship. However, this relationship fails and softening occurs at some grain sizes in the nanometer regime for some alloys. In this study, we discovered that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> deformation mechanism of extremely fine nanograined metals and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring grain boundary (GB) stability. The electrodeposited nanograined nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for grain sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB stabilization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh hardness is achieved in the nanograined samples with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> deformation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations. Grain boundary stability provides an alternative dimension, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to grain size, for producing novel nanograined metals with extraordinary properties.</p>

“Ab initio” synthesis of zeolites for preestablished catalytic reactions
<p>Unlike homogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s that are often designed for particular reactions, zeolites are heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s that are explored and optimized in a heuristic fashion. We present a methodology for synthesizing active and selective zeolites by using organic structure-directing agents that mimic the transition state (TS) of preestablished reactions to be catalyzed. In these zeolites, the pores and cavities could be generated approaching a molecular-recognition pattern. For disproportionation of toluene and isomerization of ethylbenzene into xylenes, the TSs are larger than the reaction products. Zeolite ITQ-27 showed high disproportionation activity, and ITQ-64 showed high selectivity for the desired para and ortho isomers. For the case of a product and TS of similar size, we synthesized a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>, MIT-1, for the isomerization of <i>endo</i>-dicyclopentane into adamantane.</p>

<i>SOX2</i> promotes lineage plasticity and antiandrogen resistance in <i>TP53</i>- and <i>RB1</i>-deficient prostate cancer
<p>Some cancers evade targeted therapies through a mechanism known as lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity, whereby tumor cells acquire phenotypic characteristics of a cell lineage whose survival no longer depends on the drug target. We use in vitro and in vivo human prostate cancer models to show that these tumors can develop resistance to the antiandrogen drug enzalutamide by a phenotypic shift from androgen receptor (AR)–dependent luminal epithelial cells to AR-independent basal-like cells. This lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity is enabled by the loss of TP53 and RB1 function, is mediated by increased expression of the reprogramming transcription factor <i>SOX2</i>, and can be reversed by restoring TP53 and RB1 function or by inhibiting <i>SOX2</i> expression. Thus, mutations in tumor suppressor genes can create a state of increased cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity that, when challenged with antiandrogen therapy, promotes resistance through lineage switching.</p>

Biaxially strained PtPb/Pt core/shell nanoplate boosts oxygen reduction catalysis
<p>Compressive surface strains have been necessary to boost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in core/shell M/platinum (Pt) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s (where M can be nickel, cobalt, or iron). We report on a class of platinum-lead/platinum (PtPb/Pt) core/shell nanoplate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s that exhibit large biaxial strains. The stable Pt (110) facets of the nanoplates have high ORR specific and mass activities that reach 7.8 milliampere (mA) per centimeter squared and 4.3 ampere per milligram of platinum at 0.9 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the edge-Pt and top (bottom)–Pt (110) facets undergo large tensile strains that help optimize the Pt-O bond strength. The intermetallic core and uniform four layers of Pt shell of the PtPb/Pt nanoplates appear to underlie the high endurance of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s, which can undergo 50,000 voltage cycles with negligible activity decay and no apparent structure and composition changes.</p>

Direct and continuous strain control of catalysts with tunable battery electrode materials
<p>We report a method for using battery electrode materials to directly and continuously control the lattice strain of platinum (Pt) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> and thus tune its catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Whereas the common approach of using metal overlayers introduces ligand effects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to strain, by electrochemically switching between the charging and discharging status of battery electrodes the change in volume can be precisely controlled to induce either compressive or tensile strain on supported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s. Lattice compression and tension induced by the lithium cobalt oxide substrate of ~5% were directly observed in individual Pt nanoparticles with aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. We observed 90% enhancement or 40% suppression in Pt ORR activity under compression or tension, respectively, which is consistent with theoretical predictions.</p>

A bioinspired iron catalyst for nitrate and perchlorate reduction
<p>Nitrate and perchlorate have considerable use in technology, synthetic materials, and agriculture; as a result, they have become pervasive water pollutants.

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> features a secondary coordination sphere that aids in oxyanion deoxygenation.

A Price to Pay for Adult Neurogenesis
<p>We tend to believe that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity is what makes brain circuits adaptable to continuous changes in environmental demands and that greater brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity should result in a better ability to cope with the surrounding world. To adapt to everyday life, animals explore, learn, and remember, and these tasks make use of various cortical structures, including the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus, part of the hippocampus, is a remarkable structure in that it is one of two areas of the adult mammalian brain, including the human brain, that continue to generate new neurons throughout postnatal life (<i>1</i>). It is well established that adult-born neurons integrate into preexisting neuronal networks and participate in information processing (<i>2</i>). Much evidence accumulated over the past decade supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis itself is a type of circuit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory recall. The work by Akers <i>et al.</i> on page 598 of this issue (<i>3</i>) now shows that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may also promote forgetting.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Initial Bud Outgrowth Occurs Independent of Auxin Flow from Out of Buds
<p>Apical dominance is the process whereby the shoot tip inhibits the growth of axillary buds along the stem. It has been proposed that the shoot tip, which is the predominant source of the plant hormone auxin, prevents bud outgrowth by suppressing auxin canalization and export from axillary buds into the main stem. In this theory, auxin flow out of axillary buds is a prerequisite for bud outgrowth, and buds are triggered to grow by an enhanced proportional flow of auxin from the buds. A major challenge of directly testing this model is in being able to create a bud- or stem-specific change in auxin transport. Here we evaluate the relationship between specific changes in auxin efflux from axillary buds and bud outgrowth after shoot tip removal (decapitation) in the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>). The auxin transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> 1-<i>N</i>-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and to a lesser extent, the auxin perception <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> <i>p</i>-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB), effectively blocked auxin efflux from axillary buds of intact and decapitated plants without affecting auxin flow in the main stem. Gene expression analyses indicate that NPA and PCIB regulate auxin-inducible, and biosynthesis and transport genes, in axillary buds within 3 h after application. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s had no effect on initial bud outgrowth after decapitation or cytokinin (benzyladenine; BA) treatment. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>y effects of PCIB and NPA on axillary bud outgrowth only became apparent from 48 h after treatment. These findings demonstrate that the initiation of decapitation- and cytokinin-induced axillary bud outgrowth is independent of auxin canalization and export from the bud.</p>

Abscisic Acid-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species Are Modulated by Flavonols to Control Stomata Aperture
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells to close Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomata. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), we find that ABA-increased ROS is followed by stomatal closure and that both responses are blocked by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of ROS-producing respiratory burst oxidase enzymes. ABA-induced ROS sensor fluorescence accumulates in the nucleus, chloroplasts, and endomembranes. The accumulation of flavonol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants in guard cells, but not surrounding pavement cells, was visualized by confocal microscopy using a flavonol-specific fluorescent dye. Decreased flavonols in guard cells in the <i>anthocyanin reduced</i> (<i>are</i>) mutant and elevated levels in the <i>anthocyanin without</i> (<i>aw</i>) mutant were quantified by confocal microscopy and in leaf extracts by mass spectrometry. Consistent with flavonols acting as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants, higher levels of ROS were detected in guard cells of the tomato <i>are</i> mutant and lower levels were detected in <i>aw</i> both at homeostasis and after treatment with ABA. These results demonstrate the inverse relationship between flavonols and ROS. Guard cells of <i>are</i> show greater ABA-induced closure than the wild type, reduced light-dependent guard cell opening, and reduced water loss, with <i>aw</i> having opposite responses. Ethylene treatment of wild-type tomato plants increased flavonol accumulation in guard cells; however, no flavonol increases were observed in <i>Neverripe</i> (<i>Nr</i>), an ethylene receptor mutant. Consistent with lower levels of ROS due to elevated flavonols, ethylene treatments decreased ABA-induced stomatal closure in the wild type, but not <i>Nr</i>, with ethylene responses attenuated in the <i>are</i> mutant. Together, these results are consistent with flavonols dampening the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closure and facilitating stomatal opening to modulate leaf gas exchange.</p>

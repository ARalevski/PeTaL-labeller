Metallosis following implantation of magnetically controlled growing rods in the treatment of scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present a case series of five patients who had revision surgery   following magnetic controlled growing rods (MGCR) for early onset   scoliosis. Metallosis was found during revision in four out of five   patients and we postulated a mechanism for rod failure based on   retrieval analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Retrieval analysis was performed on the seven explanted rods.   The mean duration of MCGR from implantation to revision was 35 months   (17 to 46). The mean age at revision was 12 years (7 to 15; four   boys, one girl).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of six out of seven rods had tissue metallosis and pseudo-capsule   surrounding the actuator. A total of four out of seven rods were   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piston</span></strong>ing. There were two rods which were broken. All rods had abrasive   circumferential markings. A significant amount of metal debris was   found when the actuators were carefully cut open. Analytical electron   microscopy demonstrated metal fragments of predominantly titanium   with a mean particle size of 3.36 microns (1.31 to 6.61).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study highlights concerns with tissue metallosis in MCGR.   We recommend careful follow-up of patients who have received this   implant.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1662â€“7.</p></sec>

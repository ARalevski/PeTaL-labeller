Firearms and accidental deaths: Evidence from the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting
<p>Exposure to firearms increased substantially after the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children and 6 adults were killed. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong> sales spiked by 3 million, on the basis of the increase in the number of background checks for firearm purchases. Google searches for buying and cleaning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong>s increased. We used Vital Statistics mortality data to examine whether a spike in accidental firearm deaths occurred at the same time as the greater exposure to firearms. We also assessed whether the increase in these deaths was larger in those states where the spike in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong> sales per capita was larger. We find that an additional 60 deaths overall, including 20 children, resulted from unintentional shootings in the immediate aftermath of Sandy Hook.</p>

Emails reveal pressures on NIH gun research
<p>Internal agency emails released to <i>Science</i> under the Freedom of Information Act show the political tightrope that officials at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) negotiated as they discussed whether to renew a program soliciting research on preventing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong> violence. The emails, written between October 2016 and February 2017, have come to light as some in Congress are pressuring NIH Director Francis Collins to renew the 3-year initiative, which has spent $18 million funding 22 research projects since January 2014, but which lapsed in January 2017. Last week, 26 Democrats and one Independent in the U.S. Senate wrote to Collins calling the need for more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong> research "critical" after the 1 October murders of 58 people and the injury of nearly 500 people by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong>man in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>

Ultrafast optical ranging using microresonator soliton frequency combs
<p>Light detection and ranging is widely used in science and industry. Over the past decade, optical frequency combs were shown to offer advantages in optical ranging, enabling fast distance acquisition with high accuracy. Driven by emerging high-volume applications such as industrial sensing, drone navigation, or autonomous driving, there is now a growing demand for compact ranging systems. Here, we show that soliton Kerr comb generation in integrated silicon nitride microresonators provides a route to high-performance chip-scale ranging systems. We demonstrate dual-comb distance measurements with Allan deviations down to 12 nanometers at averaging times of 13 microseconds along with ultrafast ranging at acquisition rates of 100 megahertz, allowing for in-flight sampling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong> projectiles moving at 150 meters per second. Combining integrated soliton-comb ranging systems with chip-scale nanophotonic phased arrays could enable compact ultrafast ranging systems for emerging mass applications.</p>

NIH quietly shelves gun research program
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) wasn't coy when it responded to a call from then-President Barack Obama for government agencies to do firearm research. The president's plea came on the heels of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong>man's murder of 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December, 2012. Nine months later, the huge biomedical research agency issued three notices encouraging scientists to apply to do research on violence and its prevention, particularly firearm research. NIH has since spent $18 million funding 22 projects. But the agency has now let the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong> research program lapse, <i>Science</i> has learned. It stopped taking applications in January, despite a written plea from a score of scientists, and the last new awards are now being launched. Last week, an agency spokesperson said that renewal of the program "is still under consideration," but gave no timeline for when the agency would reach a decision.</p>

The DEAD-box RNA Helicase RH50 Is a 23S-4.5S rRNA Maturation Factor that Functionally Overlaps with the Plastid Signaling Factor GUN1
<p>DEAD-box RNA helicases (DBRHs) modulate RNA secondary structure, allowing RNA molecules to adopt the conformations required for interaction with their target proteins. RH50 is a chloroplast-located DBRH that colocalizes and is coexpressed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong>1, a central factor in chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling. When combined with mutations that impair plastid gene expression (<i>prors1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prpl11</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps21</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps17</i>-<i>1</i>, and <i>prpl24</i>-<i>1</i>), <i>rh50</i> and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong>1</i> mutations evoke similar patterns of epistatic effects. These observations, together with the synergistic growth phenotype of the double mutant <i>rh50</i>-<i>1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong>1</i>-<i>102</i>, suggest that RH50 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong>1 are functionally related and that this function is associated with plastid gene expression, in particular ribosome functioning. However, <i>rh50</i>-<i>1</i> itself is not a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong> mutant, although—like <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gun</span></strong>1</i>-<i>102—</i>the <i>rh50</i>-<i>1</i> mutation suppresses the down-regulation of nuclear genes for photosynthesis induced by the <i>prors1</i>-<i>1</i> mutation. The RH50 protein comigrates with ribosomal particles, and is required for efficient translation of plastid proteins. RH50 binds to transcripts of the 23S-4.5S intergenic region and, in its absence, levels of the corresponding rRNA processing intermediate are strongly increased, implying that RH50 is required for the maturation of the 23S and 4.5S rRNAs. This inference is supported by the finding that loss of RH50 renders chloroplast protein synthesis sensitive to erythromycin and exposure to cold. Based on these results, we conclude that RH50 is a plastid rRNA maturation factor.</p>

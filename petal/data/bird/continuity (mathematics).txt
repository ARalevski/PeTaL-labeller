Topological insulator laser: Theory
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators are phases of matter characterized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder. These attributes make <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical effects in a unique way: the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser. These are lasers whose lasing mode exhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport without magnetic fields. The underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties lead to a highly efficient laser, robust to defects and disorder, with single-mode lasing even at very high gain values. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and at the same time opens exciting possibilities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical physics, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser provides a route to arrays of semiconductor lasers that operate as one single-mode high-power laser coupled efficiently into an output port.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Experiments
<p>Physical systems exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical invariants are naturally endowed with robustness against perturbations, as manifested in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators—materials exhibiting robust electron transport, immune from scattering by defects and disorder. Recent years have witnessed intense efforts toward exploiting these phenomena in photonics. Here we demonstrate a nonmagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser system exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport in the cavity. Its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties give rise to single-mode lasing, robustness against defects, and considerably higher slope efficiencies compared to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically trivial counterparts. We further exploit the properties of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical platforms by assembling the system from <i>S</i>-chiral microresonators, enforcing predetermined unidirectional lasing without magnetic fields. This work paves the way toward active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical devices with exciting properties and functionalities.</p>

Wallpaper fermions and the nonsymmorphic Dirac insulator
<p>Materials whose gapless surface states are protected by crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">symmetri</span></strong>es include mirror <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical crystalline insulators and nonsymmorphic hourglass insulators. There exists only a very limited set of possible surface crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">symmetri</span></strong>es, captured by the 17 “wallpaper groups.” Here we show that a consideration of symmetry-allowed band degeneracies in the wallpaper groups can be used to understand previously described <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical crystalline insulators and to predict phenomenologically distinct examples. In particular, the two wallpaper groups with multiple glide lines, <i>pgg</i> and <i>p</i>4<i>g</i>, allow for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulating phase whose surface spectrum consists of only a single, fourfold-degenerate, true Dirac fermion, representing an exception to a symmetry-enhanced fermion-doubling theorem. We theoretically predict the presence of this phase in Sr<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub> in space group 127 (<i>P</i>4<i>/mbm)</i>.</p>

Observation of the topological Anderson insulator in disordered atomic wires
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y and disorder have a rich combined influence on quantum transport. To probe their interplay, we synthesized one-dimensional chiral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">symmetri</span></strong>c wires with controllable disorder via spectroscopic Hamiltonian engineering, based on the laser-driven coupling of discrete momentum states of ultracold atoms. Measuring the bulk evolution of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical indicator after a sudden quench, we observed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical Anderson insulator phase, in which added disorder drives the band structure of a wire from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically trivial to nontrivial. In addition, we observed the robustness of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically nontrivial wires to weak disorder and measured the transition to a trivial phase in the presence of strong disorder. Atomic interactions in this quantum simulation platform may enable realizations of strongly interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical fluids.</p>

Electrically tunable low-density superconductivity in a monolayer topological insulator
<p>Turning on superconductivity in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically nontrivial insulator may provide a route to search for non-Abelian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical states. However, existing demonstrations of superconductor-insulator switches have involved only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically trivial systems. Here we report reversible, in situ electrostatic on-off switching of superconductivity in the recently established quantum spin Hall insulator monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe<sub>2</sub>). Fabricated into a van der Waals field-effect transistor, the monolayer’s ground state can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ously gate-tuned from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulating to the superconducting state, with critical temperatures <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> up to ~1 kelvin.

Topological origin of equatorial waves
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y sheds new light on the emergence of unidirectional edge waves in a variety of physical systems, from condensed matter to artificial lattices. Waves observed in geophysical flows are also robust to perturbations, which suggests a role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y. We show a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical origin for two well-known equatorially trapped waves, the Kelvin and Yanai modes, owing to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by Earth’s rotation. The nontrivial structure of the bulk PoincaréÉééé wave modes encoded through the first Chern number of value 2 guarantees the existence of these waves. This invariant demonstrates that ocean and atmospheric waves share fundamental properties with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y plays an unexpected role in Earth’s climate system.</p>

Quantized electric multipole insulators
<p>The Berry phase provides a modern formulation of electric polarization in crystals. We extend this concept to higher electric multipole moments and determine the necessary conditions and minimal models for which the quadrupole and octupole moments are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically quantized electromagnetic observables. Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical phases. Furthermore, they host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating phases of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical behavior that can be immediately tested.

Kilogram-scale prexasertib monolactate monohydrate synthesis under continuous-flow CGMP conditions

Here we report the development of a multistep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous-flow CGMP (current good manufacturing practices) process that produced 24 kilograms of prexasertib monolactate monohydrate suitable for use in human clinical trials.

Success was enabled by advances in chemistry, engineering, analytical science, process modeling, and equipment design. Substantial technical and business drivers were identified, which merited the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous process. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous process afforded improved performance and safety relative to batch processes and also improved containment of a highly potent compound.</p>

Geometric Morphometric Character Suites as Phylogenetic Data: Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Gastropod Shells
<p>Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many of the best represented constituents of the fossil record—including diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks—have mineralized skeletons with limited discrete characteristics, making morphological phylogenies difficult to construct. In contrast to their paucity of phylogenetic characters, the mineralized structures (tests and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive shapes that have long proved useful for their classification. The recent introduction of methodologies for including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous data directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available characters, making it possible to produce phylogenies based, in whole or part, on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous character data collected from such taxa. Geometric morphometric methods provide tools for accurately characterizing shape variation and can produce quantitative data that can therefore now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a nonarbitrary manner. Here, the marine gastropod genus <i>Conus</i> is used to evaluate the ability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous characters—generated from a geometric morphometric analysis of shell shape—to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic hypothesis constructed using molecular and morphological data. Furthermore, the ability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous characters derived from geometric morphometric analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete characters into a phylogeny with their extant relatives was tested by simulating the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular partition of individual extant species to produce a “cladistic pseudofossil” with only the geometric morphometric derived characters coded. The phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then compared with its placement in the total evidence tree and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">symmetri</span></strong>c resampling tree to evaluate the degree to which morphometric characters alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33–45% of the test cases (depending upon the approach used for measuring success), it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric characters. This suggests that the incorporation of extinct <i>Conus</i> taxa into phylogenetic hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also has potential to contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions for other major components of the fossil record that lack numerous discrete characters.

Anti–parity-time symmetry in diffusive systems
<p>Various concepts related to parity-time symmetry, including anti–parity-time symmetry, have found broad applications in wave physics. Wave systems are fundamentally described by Hermitian operators, whereas their unusual properties are introduced by incorporation of gain and loss. We propose that the related physics need not be restricted to wave dynamics, and we consider systems described by diffusive dynamics. We study the heat transfer in two countermoving media and show that this system exhibits anti–parity-time symmetry. The spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a phase transition from motionless temperature profiles, despite the mechanical motion of the background, to moving temperature profiles. Our results extend the concepts of parity-time symmetry beyond wave physics and may offer opportunities to manipulate heat and mass transport.</p>

Observation of fractional Chern insulators in a van der Waals heterostructure

We observed phases at fractional filling of bands with Chern indices [Formula]. Some of these phases, in [Formula] and [Formula] bands, are characterized by fractional Hall conductance—that is, they are known as fractional Chern insulators and constitute an example of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical order beyond Landau levels.</p>

Observation of bulk Fermi arc and polarization half charge from paired exceptional points

We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a bulk Fermi arc that develops from non-Hermitian radiative losses in an open system of photonic crystal slabs. Moreover, we discover half-integer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical charges in the polarization of far-field radiation around the bulk Fermi arc. Both phenomena are shown to be direct consequences of the non-Hermitian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties of exceptional points, where resonances coincide in their frequencies and linewidths.

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The dynamics of many-body systems spanning condensed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous phase transitions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose condensates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives condensates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the condensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.</p>

Optical skyrmion lattice in evanescent electromagnetic fields

We show that optical skyrmion lattices can be generated using evanescent electromagnetic fields and demonstrate this using surface plasmon polaritons, imaged by phase-resolved near-field optical microscopy. We show how the optical skyrmion lattice exhibits robustness to imperfections while the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical domain walls in the lattice can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ously tuned, changing the spatial structure of the skyrmions from bubble type to Néel type.

Second Chern number of a quantum-simulated non-Abelian Yang monopole

We quantify the monopole in terms of Chern numbers measured on enclosing manifolds: Whereas the well-known first Chern number vanishes, the second Chern number does not. By displacing the manifold, we induce and observe a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical transition, where the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y of the manifold changes to a trivial state.</p>

Ideal Weyl points and helicoid surface states in artificial photonic crystal structures

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

Robust spin-polarized midgap states at step edges of topological crystalline insulators

A minimal toy model and realistic tight-binding calculations identify them as spin-polarized flat bands connecting two Dirac points.

Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (<i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>)
<p>Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical abilities are widespread among vertebrates. While experiments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in <i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia desert. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not controlled for non-numerical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli controlled for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous quantities and half not controlled for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli controlled for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous quantities proved able to learn the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish tested with visual stimuli.</p>

Although photons are intrinsically well isolated from the thermal environment, scaling to large quantum optical devices is still limited by scattering loss and other errors arising from random fabrication imperfections. The recent discoveries regarding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical phases have introduced avenues to construct quantum systems that are protected against scattering and imperfections. We experimentally demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical protection of biphoton states, the building block for quantum information systems. We provide clear evidence of the robustness of the spatial features and the propagation constant of biphoton states generated within a nanophotonics lattice with nontrivial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y and propose a concrete path to build robust entangled states for quantum gates.</p>

Dirac electrons in a dodecagonal graphene quasicrystal
<p>Quantum states of quasiparticles in solids are dictated by symmetry. We have experimentally demonstrated quantum states of Dirac electrons in a two-dimensional quasicrystal without translational symmetry. A dodecagonal quasicrystalline order was realized by epitaxial growth of twisted bilayer graphene rotated exactly 30°. We grew the graphene quasicrystal up to a millimeter scale on a silicon carbide surface while maintaining the single rotation angle over an entire sample and successfully isolated the quasicrystal from a substrate, demonstrating its structural and chemical stability under ambient conditions. Multiple Dirac cones replicated with the 12-fold rotational symmetry were observed in angle-resolved photoemission spectra, which revealed anomalous strong interlayer coupling with quasi-periodicity. Our study provides a way to explore physical properties of relativistic fermions with controllable quasicrystalline orders.</p>

Emergence of coexisting ordered states in active matter systems
<p>Active systems can produce a far greater variety of ordered patterns than conventional equilibrium systems. In particular, transitions between disorder and either polar- or nematically ordered phases have been predicted and observed in two-dimensional active systems. However, coexistence between phases of different types of order has not been reported. We demonstrate the emergence of dynamic coexistence of ordered states with fluctuating nematic and polar symmetry in an actomyosin motility assay. Combining experiments with agent-based simulations, we identify sufficiently weak interactions that lack a clear alignment symmetry as a prerequisite for coexistence. Thus, the symmetry of macroscopic order becomes an emergent and dynamic property of the active system. These results provide a pathway by which living systems can express different types of order by using identical building blocks.</p>

Observation of chiral phonons
<p>Chirality reveals symmetry breaking of the fundamental interaction of elementary particles. In condensed matter, for example, the chirality of electrons governs many unconventional transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect. Here we show that phonons can exhibit intrinsic chirality in monolayer tungsten diselenide. The broken inversion symmetry of the lattice lifts the degeneracy of clockwise and counterclockwise phonon modes at the corners of the Brillouin zone. We identified the phonons by the intervalley transfer of holes through hole-phonon interactions during the indirect infrared absorption, and we confirmed their chirality by the infrared circular dichroism arising from pseudoangular momentum conservation. The chiral phonons are important for electron-phonon coupling in solids, phonon-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical states, and energy-efficient information processing.</p>

Observation of the quantum spin Hall effect up to 100 kelvin in a monolayer crystal
<p>A variety of monolayer crystals have been proposed to be two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators exhibiting the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE), possibly even at high temperatures. Here we report the observation of the QSHE in monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe<sub>2</sub>) at temperatures up to 100 kelvin. In the short-edge limit, the monolayer exhibits the hallmark transport conductance, ~<i>e</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>h</i> per edge, where <i>e</i> is the electron charge and <i>h</i> is Planck’s constant. Moreover, a magnetic field suppresses the conductance, and the observed Zeeman-type gap indicates the existence of a Kramers degenerate point and the importance of time-reversal symmetry for protection from elastic backscattering. Our results establish the QSHE at temperatures much higher than in semiconductor heterostructures and allow for exploring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical phases in atomically thin crystals.</p>

Distinguishing a Majorana zero mode using spin-resolved measurements
<p>One-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical superconductors host Majorana zero modes (MZMs), the nonlocal property of which could be exploited for quantum computing applications. We use spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy to show that MZMs realized in self-assembled Fe chains on the surface of Pb have a spin polarization that exceeds that stemming from the magnetism of these chains. This feature, captured by our model calculations, is a direct consequence of the nonlocality of the Hilbert space of MZMs emerging from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical band structure.

Quantized Faraday and Kerr rotation and axion electrodynamics of a 3D topological insulator
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators have been proposed to be best characterized as bulk magnetoelectric materials that show response functions quantized in terms of fundamental physical constants. Here, we lower the chemical potential of three-dimensional (3D) Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> films to ~30 meV above the Dirac point and probe their low-energy electrodynamic response in the presence of magnetic fields with high-precision time-domain terahertz polarimetry. For fields higher than 5 tesla, we observed quantized Faraday and Kerr rotations, whereas the dc transport is still semiclassical. A nontrivial Berry’s phase offset to these values gives evidence for axion electrodynamics and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical magnetoelectric effect. The time structure used in these measurements allows a direct measure of the fine-structure constant based on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical invariant of a solid-state system.</p>

Command of active matter by topological defects and patterns

By dispersing swimming <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> in a liquid crystalline environment with spatially varying orientation of the anisotropy axis, we demonstrate control over the distribution of bacterial concentration, as well as the geometry and polarity of their trajectories. Bacteria recognize subtle differences in liquid crystal deformations, engaging in bipolar swimming in regions of pure splay and bend but switching to unipolar swimming in mixed splay-bend regions. They differentiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical defects, heading toward defects of positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical charge and avoiding negative charges.

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect
<p>Disordered structures give rise to intriguing phenomena owing to the complex nature of their interaction with light. We report on photonic spin-symmetry breaking and unexpected spin-optical transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale disordered geometric phase structure. Weak disorder induces a photonic spin Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong disorder leads to spin-split modes in momentum space, a random optical Rashba effect. Study of the momentum space entropy reveals an optical transition upon reaching a critical point where the structure’s anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y into the disordered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the disorder strength. The photonic disordered geometric phase can serve as a platform for the study of different phenomena emerging from complex media involving spin-orbit coupling.</p>

Single polymer growth dynamics

These steps are attributable to the formation and unraveling of conformational entanglements from newly incorporated monomers, whose key features can be recapitulated with molecular dynamics simulations.

Segregation-induced ordered superstructures at general grain boundaries in a nickel-bismuth alloy
<p>The properties of materials change, sometimes catastrophically, as alloying elements and impurities accumulate preferentially at grain boundaries. Studies of bicrystals show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong> atomic patterns often arise as a result of this solute segregation at high-symmetry boundaries, but it is not known whether superstructures exist at general grain boundaries in polycrystals. In bismuth-doped polycrystalline nickel, we found that ordered, segregation-induced grain boundary superstructures occur at randomly selected general grain boundaries, and that these reconstructions are driven by the orientation of the terminating grain surfaces rather than by lattice matching between grains. This discovery shows that adsorbate-induced superstructures are not limited to special grain boundaries but may exist at a variety of general grain boundaries, and hence they can affect the performance of polycrystalline engineering alloys.</p>

Structure of a symmetric photosynthetic reaction center–photosystem

The 2.2-angstrom resolution x-ray structure of the homodimeric reaction center–photosystem from the phototroph <i>Heliobacterium modesticaldum</i> exhibits perfect <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> symmetry. The core polypeptide dimer and two small subunits coordinate 54 bacteriochlorophylls and 2 carotenoids that capture and transfer energy to the electron transfer chain at the center, which performs charge separation and consists of 6 (bacterio)chlorophylls and an iron-sulfur cluster; unlike other reaction centers, it lacks a bound quinone. This structure preserves characteristics of the ancestral reaction center, providing insight into the evolution of photosynthesis.</p>

We uncovered a multipolar nematic phase of matter in the metallic pyrochlore Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> using spatially resolved second-harmonic optical anisotropy measurements. Like previously discovered electronic nematic phases, this multipolar phase spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry while preserving translational invariance. However, it has the distinguishing property of being odd under spatial inversion, which is allowed only in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. By examining the critical behavior of the multipolar nematic order parameter, we show that it drives the thermal phase transition near 200 kelvin in Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and induces a parity-breaking lattice distortion as a secondary order.</p>

The dentate gyrus, part of the hippocampus, is a remarkable structure in that it is one of two areas of the adult mammalian brain, including the human brain, that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>e to generate new neurons throughout postnatal life (<i>1</i>). It is well established that adult-born neurons integrate into preexisting neuronal networks and participate in information processing (<i>2</i>). Much evidence accumulated over the past decade supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis itself is a type of circuit plasticity required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory recall. The work by Akers <i>et al.</i> on page 598 of this issue (<i>3</i>) now shows that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may also promote forgetting.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Stomatal Closure, Basal Leaf Embolism, and Shedding Protect the Hydraulic Integrity of Grape Stems
<p>The time scale of stomatal closure and xylem cavitation during plant dehydration, as well as the fate of embolized organs, are under debate, largely due to methodological limitations in the evaluation of embolism. While some argue that complete stomatal closure precedes the occurrence of embolism, others believe that the two are contemporaneous processes that are accompanied by daily xylem refilling. Here, we utilize an optical light transmission method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ously monitor xylem cavitation in leaves of dehydrating grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) in concert with stomatal conductance and stem and petiole hydraulic measurements. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ously monitor xylem cavitation and flow rates in the stem of an intact vine during 10 d of dehydration. The results showed that complete stomatal closure preceded the appearance of embolism in the leaves and the stem by several days. Basal leaves were more vulnerable to xylem embolism than apical leaves and, once embolized, were shed, thereby preventing further water loss and protecting the hydraulic integrity of younger leaves and the stem. As a result, embolism in the stem was minimal even when drought led to complete leaf shedding. These findings suggest that grapevine avoids xylem embolism rather than tolerates it.</p>

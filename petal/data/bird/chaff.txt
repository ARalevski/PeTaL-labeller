First opioid settlement lets researchers think big
<p>A fledgling, small-scale approach to dealing with the state's opioid crisis paid off big last week for Oklahoma State University (OSU) when it became the surprise beneficiary of a $270 million legal settlement with Purdue Pharma. It's the first agreement in some 1700 pending cases around the United States against Purdue, which makes the painkiller OxyContin, and other manufacturers of prescription opioids. On 26 March the state of Oklahoma agreed to drop its suit alleging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decept</span></strong>ive marketing practices by Purdue in exchange for a National Center for Addiction Studies and Treatment at OSU's medical complex in Tulsa. Purdue and the Sackler family, which owns the Stamford, Connecticutâ€“based company, will provide a $177 million endowment for the national center, along with $20 million over 5 years for naloxone and other drugs to treat opioid addiction. The state is continuing its suit against several other companies, with opening arguments set for 28 May.</p>

Deception by Flexible Alarm Mimicry in an African Bird
<sec><title>Trick and Treat</title><p>Forked-tailed drongos are a particularly intelligent type of bird found in Africa. Drongos associate with many other bird and mammal species, which can learn to respond to drongo warning calls. Drongos are also exceptional mimics of the other species' alarm calls. Though the increased vigilance across these multi species associations is a benefit to all, drongos sometimes use these calls as ploys to scare associated species away from food, which the drongos then steal. However, without some approach to maintain the effectiveness of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decept</span></strong>ion, the drongos' ploy would soon be detected. <bold>Flower <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 513) now show that drongos are able to fool their target species longer by flexibly varying the type of call they give.</p></sec>

Pavement cells and the topology puzzle
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Development of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaf epidermis topology is driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decept</span></strong>ively simple rules of cell division, independent of surface tension, cell size and, often complex, cell shape.</p>

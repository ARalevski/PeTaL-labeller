Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and lipids represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that lipids can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s resulted in a significant increase in fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and turnover of membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty acid peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty acids in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and fatty acid turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane lipids, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty acid flux between the two lipid biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty acid β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

The [4Fe4S] cluster of human DNA primase functions as a redox switch using DNA charge transport
<p>DNA charge transport chemistry offers a means of long-range, rapid redox signaling. We demonstrate that the [4Fe4S] cluster in human DNA primase can make use of this chemistry to coordinate the first steps of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. Using DNA electrochemistry, we found that a change in oxidation state of the [4Fe4S] cluster acts as a switch for DNA binding. Single-atom mutations that inhibit this charge transfer hinder primase initiation without affecting primase structure or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization. Generating a single base mismatch in the growing primer duplex, which attenuates DNA charge transport, inhibits primer truncation. Thus, redox signaling by [4Fe4S] clusters using DNA charge transport regulates primase binding to DNA and illustrates chemistry that may efficiently drive substrate handoff between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ases during DNA replication.</p>

GTPase activity–coupled treadmilling of the bacterial tubulin FtsZ organizes septal cell wall synthesis
<p>The bacterial tubulin FtsZ is the central component of the cell division machinery, coordinating an ensemble of proteins involved in septal cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s to ensure successful constriction. How cells achieve this coordination is unknown. We found that in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells, FtsZ exhibits dynamic treadmilling predominantly determined by its guanosine triphosphatase activity. The treadmilling dynamics direct the processive movement of the septal cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s machinery but do not limit the rate of septal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. In FtsZ mutants with severely reduced treadmilling, the spatial distribution of septal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and the molecular composition and ultrastructure of the septal cell wall were substantially altered. Thus, FtsZ treadmilling provides a mechanism for achieving uniform septal cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s to enable correct polar morphology.</p>

Synthesis of resveratrol tetramers via a stereoconvergent radical equilibrium
<p>Persistent free radicals have become indispensable in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of organic materials through living radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization. However, examples of their use in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of small molecules are rare.

The spontaneous cleavage and reconstitution of exceptionally weak carbon-carbon bonds has enabled a stereoconvergent oxidative dimerization of racemic materials in a transformation that likely coincides with the biogenesis of these natural products.

Catalyst-controlled stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers
<p>The tacticity of vinyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>s has a profound effect on their physical properties. Despite the well-developed stereoselective methods for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization of propylene and other nonpolar α-olefins, stereoselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization of polar vinyl monomers has proven more challenging. We have designed chiral counterions that systematically bias the reactivity and chain-end stereochemical environment during cationic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization. This approach overrides conventional chain-end stereochemical bias to achieve catalyst-controlled stereoselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization. We demonstrate that this method is general to vinyl ether substrates, providing access to a range of isotactic poly(vinyl ether)s with high degrees of isotacticity. The obtained materials display the tensile properties of commercial polyolefins but adhere more strongly to polar substrates by an order of magnitude, indicating their promise for next-generation engineering applications.</p>

Catalytic reductive [4 + 1]-cycloadditions of vinylidenes and dienes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycloaddit</span></strong>ion reactions provide direct and convergent routes to cycloalkanes, making them valuable targets for the development of synthetic methods. Whereas six-membered rings are readily accessible from Diels-Alder reactions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycloaddit</span></strong>ions that generate five-membered rings are comparatively limited in scope. Here, we report that dinickel complexes catalyze [4 + 1]-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycloaddit</span></strong>ion reactions of 1,3-dienes. The C<sub>1</sub> partner is a vinylidene equivalent generated from the reductive activation of a 1,1-dichloroalkene in the presence of stoichiometric zinc.

Catalytic palladium-oxyallyl cycloaddition
<p>Exploration of intermediates that enable chemoselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycloaddit</span></strong>ion reactions and expeditious construction of fused- or bridged-ring systems is a continuous challenge for organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. As an intermediate of interest, the oxyallyl cation has been harnessed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>ze architectures containing seven-membered rings via (4+3) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycloaddit</span></strong>ion. However, its potential to access five-membered skeletons is underdeveloped, largely due to the thermally forbidden (3+2) pathway. Here, the combination of a tailored precursor and a Pd(0) catalyst generates a Pd-oxyallyl intermediate that cyclizes with conjugated dienes to produce a diverse array of tetrahydrofuran skeletons. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycloaddit</span></strong>ion overrides conventional (4+3) selectivity by proceeding through a stepwise pathway involving a Pd-allyl transfer and ring closure sequence. Subsequent treatment of the (3+2) adducts with a palladium catalyst converts the heterocycles to the carbocyclic cyclopentanones.</p>

Nutrient Signaling in Protein Homeostasis: An Increase in Quantity at the Expense of Quality

Local protein synthesis is a ubiquitous feature of neuronal pre- and postsynaptic compartments
<p>There is ample evidence for localization of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s in neuronal dendrites; however, demonstrations of these processes in presynaptic terminals are limited. We used expansion microscopy to resolve pre- and postsynaptic compartments in rodent neurons. Most presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus and forebrain contained mRNA and ribosomes. We sorted fluorescently labeled mouse brain synaptosomes and then sequenced hundreds of mRNA species present within excitatory boutons. After brief metabolic labeling, >30% of all presynaptic terminals exhibited a signal, providing evidence for ongoing protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. We tested different classic plasticity paradigms and observed distinct patterns of rapid pre- and/or postsynaptic translation. Thus, presynaptic terminals are translationally competent, and local protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s is differentially recruited to drive compartment-specific phenotypes that underlie different forms of plasticity.</p>

Structures and operating principles of the replisome
<p>Visualization in atomic detail of the replisome that performs concerted leading– and lagging–DNA strand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s at a replication fork has not been reported.

Each domain of the spiral-shaped hexameric helicase translocates sequentially hand-over-hand along a single-stranded DNA coil, akin to the way AAA+ ATPases (adenosine triphosphatases) unfold peptides. Two lagging-strand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ases are attached to the primase, ready for Okazaki fragment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s in tandem.

High-resolution cryo-EM analysis of the yeast ATP synthase in a lipid membrane
<p>Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase comprises a membrane embedded F<sub>o</sub> motor that rotates to drive ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s in the F<sub>1</sub> subunit. We used single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain structures of the full complex in a lipid bilayer in the absence or presence of the inhibitor oligomycin at 3.6- and 3.8-angstrom resolution, respectively. To limit conformational heterogeneity, we locked the rotor in a single conformation by fusing the F6 subunit of the stator with the δ subunit of the rotor. Assembly of the enzyme with the F6-δ fusion caused a twisting of the rotor and a 9° rotation of the F<sub>o</sub> c<sub>10</sub>-ring in the direction of ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, relative to the structure of isolated F<sub>o</sub>.

Single polymer growth dynamics

Focusing on ring-opening metathesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization, we found that the extension of a growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong> under a pulling force does not increase continuously but exhibits wait-and-jump steps. These steps are attributable to the formation and unraveling of conformational entanglements from newly incorporated monomers, whose key features can be recapitulated with molecular dynamics simulations.

The Largest Subunit of DNA Polymerase Delta Is Required for Normal Formation of Meiotic Type I Crossovers
<p>Meiotic recombination contributes to the maintenance of the association between homologous chromosomes (homologs) and ensures the accurate segregation of homologs during anaphase I, thus facilitating the redistribution of alleles among progeny. Meiotic recombination is initiated by the programmed formation of DNA double strand breaks, the repair of which requires DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, but the role of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s proteins during meiosis is largely unknown. Here, we hypothesized that the lagging strand-specific DNA Polymerase δ (POL δ) might be required for meiotic recombination, based on a previous analysis of DNA Replication Factor1 that suggested a role for lagging strand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s in meiotic recombination. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), complete mutation of the catalytic subunit of POL δ, encoded by <i>AtPOLD1</i>, leads to embryo lethality. Therefore, we used a meiocyte-specific knockdown strategy to test this hypothesis. Reduced expression of <i>AtPOLD1</i> in meiocytes caused decreased fertility and meiotic defects, including incomplete synapsis, the formation of multivalents, chromosome fragmentation, and improper segregation. Analysis of meiotic crossover (CO) frequencies showed that <i>AtPOLD1<sup>RNAi</sup></i> plants had significantly fewer interference-sensitive COs than the wild type, indicating that AtPOL δ participates in type I CO formation. <i>AtPOLD1<sup>RNAi</sup> atpol2a</i> double mutant meiocytes displayed more severe meiotic phenotypes than those of either single mutant, suggesting that the function of AtPOLD1 and AtPOL2A is not identical in meiotic recombination. Given that POL δ is highly conserved among eukaryotes, we hypothesize that the described role of POL δ here in meiotic recombination likely exists widely in eukaryotes.</p>

NMT1 and NMT3 <i>N</i>-Methyltransferase Activity Is Critical to Lipid Homeostasis, Morphogenesis, and Reproduction
<p>Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a major membrane phospholipid and a precursor for major signaling molecules. Understanding its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s is important for improving plant growth, nutritional value, and resistance to stress. PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s is complex, involving several interconnected pathways, one of which proceeds from serine-derived phosphoethanolamine to form phosphocholine through three sequential phospho-base methylations catalyzed by phosphoethanolamine <i>N</i>-methyltransferases (PEAMTs). The contribution of this pathway to the production of PC and plant growth has been a matter of some debate. Although a handful of individual PEAMTs have been described, there has not been any in planta investigation of a PEAMT family. Here, we provide a comparative functional analysis of two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PEAMTs, NMT1 and the little known NMT3. Analysis of loss-of-function mutants demonstrates that NMT1 and NMT3 synergistically regulate PC homeostasis, phase transition at the shoot apex, coordinated organ development, and fertility through overlapping but also specific functions. The <i>nmt1 nmt3</i> double mutant shows extensive sterility, drastically reduced PC concentrations, and altered lipid profiles. These findings demonstrate that the phospho-base methylation pathway makes a major contribution to PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s in Arabidopsis and that NMT1 and NMT3 play major roles in its catalysis and the regulation of PC homeostasis as well as in plant growth and reproduction.</p>

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying amyloplast development and starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, we isolated a series of floury endosperm mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We identified the rice mutant <i>floury shrunken endosperm1</i> (<i>fse1</i>), which exhibited obvious defects in the development of compound starch grains, decreased starch content, and altered starch physicochemical features. Map-based cloning showed that <i>FSE1</i> encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A<sub>1</sub>. <i>FSE1</i> was expressed ubiquitously with abundant levels observed in developing seeds and roots. FSE1 was localized to both the cytosol and intracellular membranes. Lipid profiling indicated that total extra-plastidic lipids and phosphatidic acid were increased in <i>fse1</i> plants, suggesting that FSE1 may exhibit in vivo phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> activity on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidyl-Ser, phosphatidylethanolamine, and, in particular, phosphatidic acid. Additionally, the total galactolipid content in developing <i>fse1</i> endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast development.

Wounding Triggers Callus Formation via Dynamic Hormonal and Transcriptional Changes
<p>Wounding is a primary trigger of organ regeneration, but how wound stress reactivates cell proliferation and promotes cellular reprogramming remains elusive. In this study, we combined transcriptome analysis with quantitative hormonal analysis to investigate how wounding induces callus formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our time course RNA-seq analysis revealed that wounding induces dynamic transcriptional changes, starting from rapid stress responses followed by the activation of metabolic processes and protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and subsequent activation of cell cycle regulators. Gene ontology analyses further uncovered that wounding modifies the expression of hormone bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and response genes, and quantitative analysis of endogenous plant hormones revealed accumulation of cytokinin prior to callus formation. Mutants defective in cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and signaling display reduced efficiency in callus formation, indicating that de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of cytokinin is critical for wound-induced callus formation. We further demonstrate that type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR-mediated cytokinin signaling regulates the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;1</i> (<i>CYCD3;1</i>) and that mutations in <i>CYCD3;1</i> and its homologs <i>CYCD3;2</i> and <i>3</i> cause defects in callus formation. In addition to these hormone-mediated changes, our transcriptome data uncovered that wounding activates multiple developmental regulators, and we found novel roles of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 115 and PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLT5, and PLT7 in callus generation. All together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into how wounding reactivates cell proliferation during callus formation.</p>

The <i>adg1</i> mutation disables the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the first step in starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, and the <i>suc2</i> mutation disables a sucrose/proton symporter that facilitates sucrose loading from leaves into phloem. The <i>adg1suc2</i> double mutant increases glucose plus sucrose content in leaves 80-fold relative to the wild type, total fatty acid (FA) content 1.8-fold to 8.3% dry weight, and TAG more than 10-fold to 1.2% dry weight. The WRINKLED1 transcription factor also accumulates to higher levels in these leaves, and the rate of FA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s increases by 58%. Adding <i>tt4</i>, which disables chalcone synthase, had little effect, but adding the <i>tgd1</i> mutation, which disables an importer of lipids into plastids to create <i>adg1suc2tt4tgd1</i>, increased total leaf FA to 13.5% dry weight and TAG to 3.8% dry weight, demonstrating a synergistic effect upon combining these mutations. Combining <i>adg1suc2</i> with the <i>sdp1</i> mutation, deficient in the predominant TAG lipase, had little effect on total FA content but increased the TAG accumulation by 66% to 2% dry weight. Expression of the <i>WRINKLED1</i> transcription factor, along with <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> and the <i>OLEOSIN1</i> oil body-associated protein, in the <i>adg1suc2</i> mutant doubled leaf FA content and increased TAG content to 2.3% dry weight, a level 4.6-fold higher than that resulting from expression of the same factors in the wild type.</p>

Functional Specialization of Cellulose Synthase Isoforms in a Moss Shows Parallels with Seed Plants

The cellulose-deficient midribs of <i>ppcesa3/8</i> knockouts provided negative controls for the structural characterization of stereid secondary cell walls in wild type <i>P. patens</i>. Sum frequency generation spectra collected from midribs were consistent with cellulose microfibril aggregation, and polarization microscopy revealed helical microfibril orientation only in wild type leaves. Thus, stereid secondary walls are structurally distinct from primary cell walls, and they share structural characteristics with the secondary walls of tracheary elements and fibers. We propose a mechanism for the convergent evolution of secondary walls in which the deposition of aggregated and helically oriented microfibrils is coupled to rapid and highly localized cellulose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s enabled by regulatory uncoupling from primary wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s.</p>

Synthesis and Self-Assembly of Cellulose Microfibrils from Reconstituted Cellulose Synthase
<p>Cellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, can be converted to bioethanol and is thus highly studied. In plants, cellulose is produced by cellulose synthase, a processive family-2 glycosyltransferase. In plant cell walls, individual β-1,4-glucan chains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ized by CesA are assembled into microfibrils that are frequently bundled into macrofibrils. An in vitro system in which cellulose is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>zed and assembled into fibrils would facilitate detailed study of this process. Here, we report the heterologous expression and partial purification of His-tagged CesA5 from <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Immunoblot analysis and mass spectrometry confirmed enrichment of PpCesA5. The recombinant protein was functional when reconstituted into liposomes made from yeast total lipid extract. The functional studies included incorporation of radiolabeled Glc, linkage analysis, and imaging of cellulose microfibril formation using transmission electron microscopy. Several microfibrils were observed either inside or on the outer surface of proteoliposomes, and strikingly, several thinner fibrils formed ordered bundles that either covered the surfaces of proteoliposomes or were spawned from liposome surfaces. We also report this arrangement of fibrils made by proteoliposomes bearing CesA8 from hybrid aspen. These observations describe minimal systems of membrane-reconstituted CesAs that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ize β-1,4-glucan chains that coalesce to form microfibrils and higher-ordered macrofibrils. How these micro- and macrofibrils relate to those found in primary and secondary plant cell walls is uncertain, but their presence enables further study of the mechanisms that govern the formation and assembly of fibrillar cellulosic structures and cell wall composites during or after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization process controlled by CesA proteins.</p>

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be water permeable, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>−</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated water loss by reducing urine output, which led to a reduction (by 29–76%) in ammonia excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent reduction (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of water to flush the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s occurred without the accumulation of ammonia and total free amino acids, it can be deduced that ammonia production through amino acid catabolism was suppressed with a proportional reduction in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in ammonia production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in water, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a reduction in ammonia production, instead of increased urea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, as the major strategy to ameliorate ammonia toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure.</p>

A SAP domain-containing protein shuttles between the nucleus and cell membranes and plays a role in adhesion and migration in <i>D. discoideum</i>
<p>The AmpA protein reduces cell adhesion, thereby influencing cell migration in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. To understand how <i>ampA</i> influences cell migration, second site suppressors of an AmpA overexpressing cell line were created by REMI mutagenesis. Mutant candidates were identified by their ability to suppress the large plaques that the AmpA overexpressing cells form on bacterial lawns as a result of their increased rate of migration. One suppressor gene, <i>sma</i>, encodes an uncharacterized protein, which contains a SAP DNA-binding domain and a PTEN-like domain. Using <i>sma</i> gene knockouts and Sma-mRFP expressing cell lines, a role for <i>sma</i> in influencing cell migration was uncovered. Knockouts of the <i>sma</i> gene in a wild-type background enhanced chemotaxis. An additional role for Sma in influencing cell–cell adhesion was also demonstrated. Sma protein transitions between cytosolic and nuclear localizations as a function of cell density. In growing cells migrating to folic acid it is localized to regions of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization and absent from the nucleus. A role for Sma in influencing <i>ampA</i> mRNA levels is also demonstrated. Sma additionally appears to be involved in <i>ampA</i> pathways regulating cell size, actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization, and cell substrate adhesion. We present insights to the SAP domain-containing group of proteins in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and provide evidence of a role for a SAP domain-containing protein shuttling from the nucleus to sites of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization during chemotaxis to folic acid and influencing the efficiency of migration.</p>

A modular and enantioselective synthesis of the pleuromutilin antibiotics
<p>The tricyclic diterpene fungal metabolite (+)-pleuromutilin has served as a starting point for antibiotic development. Semisynthetic modification of its glycolic acid subunit at C14 provided the first analogs fit for human use, and derivatization at C12 led to 12-<i>epi</i>-pleuromutilins with extended-spectrum antibacterial activity, including activity against Gram-negative pathogens. Given the inherent limitations of semi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, however, accessing derivatives of (+)-pleuromutilin with full control over their structure presents an opportunity to develop derivatives with improved antibacterial activities. Here we disclose a modular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of pleuromutilins by the convergent union of an enimide with a bifunctional iodoether. We illustrate our approach through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of (+)-12-<i>epi</i>-mutilin, (+)-11,12-di-<i>epi</i>-mutilin, (+)-12-<i>epi</i>-pleuromutilin, (+)-11,12-di-<i>epi</i>-pleuromutilin, and (+)-pleuromutilin itself in 17 to 20 steps.</p>

Active sites for CO<sub>2</sub> hydrogenation to methanol on Cu/ZnO catalysts
<p>The active sites over commercial copper/zinc oxide/aluminum oxide (Cu/ZnO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) catalysts for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) hydrogenation to methanol, the Zn-Cu bimetallic sites or ZnO-Cu interfacial sites, have recently been the subject of intense debate. We report a direct comparison between the activity of ZnCu and ZnO/Cu model catalysts for methanol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. By combining x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, density functional theory, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we can identify and characterize the reactivity of each catalyst. Both experimental and theoretical results agree that ZnCu undergoes surface oxidation under the reaction conditions so that surface Zn transforms into ZnO and allows ZnCu to reach the activity of ZnO/Cu with the same Zn coverage. Our results highlight a synergy of Cu and ZnO at the interface that facilitates methanol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s via formate intermediates.</p>

Radical-polar crossover reactions of vinylboron ate complexes
<p>Vinyl boronic esters are valuable substrates for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. However, boron-substituted alkenes have drawn little attention as radical acceptors, and the radical chemistry of vinylboron ate complexes is underexplored. We show here that carbon radicals add efficiently to vinylboron ate complexes and that their adduct radical anions undergo radical-polar crossover: A 1,2-alkyl/aryl shift from boron to the α-carbon sp<sup>2</sup> center provides secondary or tertiary alkyl boronic esters. In contrast to the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, a transition metal is not required, and two carbon-carbon bonds are formed. The valuable boronic ester moiety remains in the product and can be used in follow-up chemistry, enlarging the chemical space of the method. The cascade uses commercial starting materials and provides access to perfluoroalkylated alcohols, γ-lactones, γ-hydroxy alkylnitriles, and compounds bearing quaternary carbon centers.</p>

Treadmilling by FtsZ filaments drives peptidoglycan synthesis and bacterial cell division
<p>The mechanism by which bacteria divide is not well understood. Cell division is mediated by filaments of FtsZ and FtsA (FtsAZ) that recruit septal peptidoglycan-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>zing enzymes to the division site. To understand how these components coordinate to divide cells, we visualized their movements relative to the dynamics of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s during cytokinesis. We found that the division septum was built at discrete sites that moved around the division plane. FtsAZ filaments treadmilled circumferentially around the division ring and drove the motions of the peptidoglycan-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>zing enzymes. The FtsZ treadmilling rate controlled both the rate of peptidoglycan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and cell division. Thus, FtsZ treadmilling guides the progressive insertion of new cell wall by building increasingly smaller concentric rings of peptidoglycan to divide the cell.</p>

Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carriers Prevent Cadmium Toxicity by Sustaining the TCA Cycle and Glutathione Synthesis
<p>Cadmium (Cd) is a major heavy metal pollutant, and Cd toxicity is a serious cause of abiotic stress in the environment. Plants protect themselves against Cd stress through a variety of pathways. In a recent study, we found that mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (MPCs) are involved in Cd tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Following the identification of MPCs in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) in 2012, most studies have focused on the function of MPCs in animals, as a possible approach to reduce the risk of cancer developing. The results of this study show that AtMPC protein complexes are required for Cd tolerance and prevention of Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis. AtMPC complexes are composed of two elements, AtMPC1 and AtMPC2 (AtNRGA1 or AtMPC3). When the formation of AtMPCs was interrupted by the loss of <i>AtMPC1</i>, glutamate could supplement the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of acetyl-coenzyme A and sustain the TCA cycle. With the up-regulation of glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s following exposure to Cd stress, the supplementary pathway could not efficiently drive the tricarboxylic acid cycle without AtMPC. The ATP content decreased concomitantly with the deletion of tricarboxylic acid activity, which led to Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis. More importantly, ScMPCs were also required for Cd tolerance in yeast. Our results suggest that the mechanism of Cd tolerance may be similar in other species.</p>

Natural Variation in 9-Cis-Epoxycartenoid Dioxygenase 3 and ABA Accumulation
<p>The stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical for drought resistance; however, mechanisms controlling ABA levels are unclear. At low water potential, ABA accumulation in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accession Shahdara (Sha) was less than that in Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>) or Columbia. Analysis of a L<i>er</i> × Sha recombinant inbred line population revealed a single major-effect quantitative trait locus for ABA accumulation, which included <i>9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase3</i> (<i>NCED3</i>) as a candidate gene. <i>NCED3</i> encodes a rate-limiting enzyme for stress-induced ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. Complementation experiments indicated that Sha has a reduced-function <i>NCED3</i> allele. Compared with L<i>er</i>, Sha did not have reduced <i>NCED3</i> gene expression or protein level but did have four amino acid substitutions within NCED3. Sha differed from L<i>er</i> in the apparent molecular mass of NCED3, indicative of altered NCED3 proteolytic processing in the chloroplast. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that substitution at amino acid 271 was critical for the altered NCED3 molecular mass pattern, while the other Sha NCED3 polymorphisms were also involved in the reduced ABA accumulation. Sha did not have a reduced level of thylakoid-bound NCED3 but did differ from L<i>er</i> in the apparent molecular mass of stromal NCED3. As Sha was not impaired in known factors critical for NCED3 function in ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s (expression, chloroplast import, and thylakoid binding), the differences between L<i>er</i> and Sha NCED3 may affect NCED3 activity or other factors influencing NCED3 function. These results identify functionally important sites on NCED3 and indicate a complex pattern of NCED3 posttranslational regulation in the chloroplast.</p>

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring seed oils to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low seed oil content and poor seedling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks efficient metabolic networks for bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. This produced abundant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of seed HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more abundant than any other fatty acid in these seeds, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in seeds following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. Efficient utilization of hydroxy-containing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-oil phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage lipid available for mobilization during seedling development, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in seedling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to efficiently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified oils in plants.</p>

NRT1.1-Related NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Toxicity Is Associated with a Disturbed Balance between NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Uptake and Assimilation
<p>A high concentration of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) as the sole source of nitrogen in the growth medium often is toxic to plants. The nitrate transporter NRT1.1 is involved in mediating the effects of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity; however, the mechanism remains undefined. In this study, wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Columbia-0 [Col-0]) and <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants (<i>chl1-1</i> and <i>chl1-5</i>) were grown hydroponically in NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> media to assess the function of NRT1.1 in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress responses. All the plants grew normally in medium containing mixed nitrogen sources, but Col-0 displayed more chlorosis and lower biomass and photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s than the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants in (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium. Grafting experiments between Col-0 and <i>chl1-5</i> further confirmed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity is influenced by NRT1.1. In (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium, NRT1.1 induced the expression of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> transporters, increasing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake. Additionally, the activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthetase in roots of Col-0 plants decreased and soluble sugar accumulated significantly, whereas pyruvate kinase-mediated glycolysis was not affected, all of which contributed to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation. By contrast, the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants showed reduced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation through glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthetase, and glutamate dehydrogenase. Moreover, the up-regulation of genes involved in ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and senescence in Col-0 plants treated with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> suggests that ethylene is involved in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity responses. This study showed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity is related to a nitrate-independent signaling function of <i>NRT1.1</i> in Arabidopsis, characterized by enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and altered NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> metabolism, which stimulates ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, leading to plant senescence.</p>

Chloroplast Damage Induced by the Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthesis Triggers Autophagy in Chlamydomonas
<p>Fatty acids are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>zed in the stroma of plant and algal chloroplasts by the fatty acid synthase complex. Newly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>zed fatty acids are then used to generate plastidial lipids that are essential for chloroplast structure and function. Here, we show that inhibition of fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> activates autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic process by which cells degrade intracellular material under adverse conditions to maintain cell homeostasis. Treatment of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells with cerulenin, a specific fatty acid synthase inhibitor, stimulated lipidation of the autophagosome protein ATG8 and enhanced autophagic flux. We found that inhibition of fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s decreased monogalactosyldiacylglycerol abundance, increased lutein content, down-regulated photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species. Electron microscopy revealed a high degree of thylakoid membrane stacking in cerulenin-treated cells. Moreover, global transcriptomic analysis of these cells showed an up-regulation of genes encoding chloroplast proteins involved in protein folding and oxidative stress and the induction of major catabolic processes, including autophagy and proteasome pathways. Thus, our results uncovered a link between lipid metabolism, chloroplast integrity, and autophagy through a mechanism that involves the activation of a chloroplast quality control system.</p>

ZmbZIP4 Contributes to Stress Resistance in Maize by Regulating ABA Synthesis and Root Development
<p>In plants, bZIP (basic leucine zipper) transcription factors regulate diverse processes such as development and stress responses. However, few of these transcription factors have been functionally characterized in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). In this study, we characterized the bZIP transcription factor gene <i>ZmbZIP4</i> from maize. <i>ZmbZIP4</i> was differentially expressed in various organs of maize and was induced by high salinity, drought, heat, cold, and abscisic acid treatment in seedlings. A transactivation assay in yeast demonstrated that ZmbZIP4 functioned as a transcriptional activator. A genome-wide screen for ZmbZIP4 targets by immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that ZmbZIP4 could positively regulate a number of stress response genes, such as <i>ZmLEA2</i>, <i>ZmRD20</i>, <i>ZmRD21</i>, <i>ZmRab18</i>, <i>ZmNHX3</i>, <i>ZmGEA6</i>, and <i>ZmERD</i>, and some abscisic acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s-related genes, including <i>NCED</i>, <i>ABA1</i>, <i>AAO3</i>, and <i>LOS5</i>.

Increased abscisic acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s by overexpression of <i>ZmbZIP4</i> also can increase the plant’s ability to resist abiotic stress. Thus, ZmbZIP4 is a positive regulator of plant abiotic stress responses and is involved in root development in maize.</p>

The Regulation of Sporopollenin Biosynthesis Genes for Rapid Pollen Wall Formation
<p>Sporopollenin is the major component of the outer pollen wall (sexine). It is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>zed using a pathway of approximately eight genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). MALE STERILITY188 (MS188) and its direct upstream regulator ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS) are two transcription factors essential for tapetum development. Here, we show that all the sporopollenin bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s proteins are specifically expressed in the tapetum and are secreted into anther locules. MS188, a MYB transcription factor expressed in the tapetum, directly regulates the expression of <i>POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE A</i> (<i>PKSA</i>), <i>PKSB</i>, <i>MALE STERILE2</i> (<i>MS2</i>), and a CYTOCHROME P450 gene (<i>CYP703A2</i>). By contrast, the expression of <i>CYP704B1</i>, <i>ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE5</i> (<i>ACOS5</i>), <i>TETRAKETIDE a-PYRONE REDUCTASE1</i> (<i>TKPR1</i>) and <i>TKPR2</i> are significantly reduced in <i>ams</i> mutants but not affected in <i>ms188</i> mutants. However, MS188 but not AMS can activate the expression of <i>CYP704B1</i>, <i>ACOS5</i>, and <i>TKPR1</i>. In <i>ms188</i>, dominant suppression of MS188 homologs reduced the expression of these genes, suggesting that MS188 and other MYB family members play redundant roles in activating their expression. The expression of some sporopollenin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s genes (<i>PKSA</i>, <i>PKSB</i>, <i>TKPR2</i>, <i>CYP704B1</i>, and <i>ACOS5</i>) was rescued when <i>MS188</i> was expressed in <i>ams</i>. Therefore, MS188 is a key regulator for activation of sporopollenin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, and AMS and MS188 may form a feed-forward loop that activates the expression of the sporopollenin bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s pathway for rapid pollen wall formation.</p>

The Ancient Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling System Is a Master Regulator of Energy and Carbon Metabolism in Algae
<p>Algae undergo a complete metabolic transformation under stress by arresting cell growth, inducing autophagy and hyper-accumulating biofuel precursors such as triacylglycerols and starch. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this stress-induced transformation are still unclear. Here, we use biochemical, mutational, and “omics” approaches to demonstrate that PI3K signaling mediates the homeostasis of energy molecules and influences carbon metabolism in algae. In <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, the inhibition and knockdown (KD) of algal class III PI3K led to significantly decreased cell growth, altered cell morphology, and higher lipid and starch contents. Lipid profiling of wild-type and PI3K KD lines showed significantly reduced membrane lipid breakdown under nitrogen starvation (−N) in the KD. RNA-seq and network analyses showed that under −N conditions, the KD line carried out lipogenesis rather than lipid hydrolysis by initiating de novo fatty acid bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, which was supported by tricarboxylic acid cycle down-regulation and via acetyl-CoA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s from glycolysis. Remarkably, autophagic responses did not have primacy over inositide signaling in algae, unlike in mammals and vascular plants. The mutant displayed a fundamental shift in intracellular energy flux, analogous to that in tumor cells. The high free fatty acid levels and reduced mitochondrial ATP generation led to decreased cell viability. These results indicate that the PI3K signal transduction pathway is the metabolic gatekeeper restraining biofuel yields, thus maintaining fitness and viability under stress in algae. This study demonstrates the existence of homeostasis between starch and lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s controlled by lipid signaling in algae and expands our understanding of such processes, with biotechnological and evolutionary implications.</p>

<p>Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) have housekeeping roles in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, but little is known about how these aaRSs are involved in organ development. Here, we report that a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (OsERS1) maintains proper somatic cell organization and limits the overproliferation of male germ cells during early anther development. The expression of <i>OsERS1</i> is specifically detectable in meristematic layer 2-derived cells of the early anther, and <i>osers1</i> anthers exhibit overproliferation and disorganization of layer 2-derived cells, producing fused lobes and extra germ cells in early anthers. The conserved biochemical function of OsERS1 in ligating glutamate to tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> is enhanced by its cofactor aaRS OsARC. Furthermore, metabolomics profiling revealed that OsERS1 is an important node for multiple metabolic pathways, indicated by the accumulation of amino acids and tricarboxylic acid cycle components in <i>osers1</i> anthers. Notably, the anther defects of the <i>osers1</i> mutant are causally associated with the abnormal accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, which can reconstitute the <i>osers1</i> phenotype when applied to wild-type anthers. Collectively, these findings demonstrate how aaRSs affect male organ development in plants, likely through protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, metabolic homeostasis, and redox status.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

Exploiting CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA) Class Specificity to Probe Cellulose Microfibril Biosynthesis
<p>Cellulose microfibrils are the basic units of cellulose in plants. The structure of these microfibrils is at least partly determined by the structure of the cellulose synthase complex. In higher plants, this complex is composed of 18 to 24 catalytic subunits known as CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins. Three different classes of CESA proteins are required for cellulose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and for secondary cell wall cellulose bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s these classes are represented by CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. To probe the relationship between CESA proteins and microfibril structure, we created mutant cesa proteins that lack catalytic activity but retain sufficient structural integrity to allow assembly of the cellulose synthase complex. Using a series of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants and genetic backgrounds, we found consistent differences in the ability of these mutant cesa proteins to complement the cellulose-deficient phenotype of the <i>cesa</i> null mutants. The best complementation was observed with catalytically inactive cesa4, while the equivalent mutation in cesa8 exhibited significantly lower levels of complementation. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared microscopy, to study these mutant plants, we found evidence for changes in cellulose microfibril structure, but these changes largely correlated with cellulose content and reflected differences in the relative proportions of primary and secondary cell walls. Our results suggest that individual CESA classes have similar roles in determining cellulose microfibril structure, and it is likely that the different effects of mutating members of different CESA classes are the consequence of their different catalytic activity and their influence on the overall rate of cellulose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s.</p>

<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Induces the Expression of a MicroRNA to Suppress the Immune Response in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs play crucial roles in plant responses to pathogen infections. The rice blast disease, caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most important disease of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). To explore the microRNA species that participate in rice immunity against the rice blast disease, we compared the expression of small RNAs between mock- and <i>M. oryzae</i>-treated rice. We found that infection by <i>M. oryzae</i> strain Guy11 specifically induced the expression of rice miR319 and, consequently, suppressed its target gene <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR1</i> (<i>OsTCP21</i>), which encodes a transcription factor. Using transgenic rice that overexpresses miR319b (OE) or expresses <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res (which is resistant to miR319-mediated silencing), we found that <i>OsTCP21</i> is a positive regulator of the rice defense response against the blast disease. When wild-type and miR319b-OE rice were infected by Guy11, multiple jasmonic acid (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating that Guy11 suppresses JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that <i>LIPOXYGENASE2</i> (<i>LOX2</i>) and <i>LOX5</i> were specifically suppressed by miR319 overexpression or by Guy11 infection. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, which catalyze the conversion of α-linoleic acid to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid. The application of α-linoleic acid rescued disease symptoms on the <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res rice but not wild-type rice, supporting our hypothesis that <i>OsLOX2</i> and <i>OsLOX5</i> are the key JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s genes hijacked by Guy11 to subvert host immunity and facilitate pathogenicity. We propose that induced expression of <i>OsLOX2/5</i> may improve resistance to the rice blast disease.</p>

The Ribosome-Bound Protein Pam68 Promotes Insertion of Chlorophyll into the CP47 Subunit of Photosystem II
<p>Photosystem II (PSII) is a large enzyme complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane of oxygenic phototrophs. The biogenesis of PSII requires the assembly of more than 30 subunits, with the assistance of a number of auxiliary proteins. In plants and cyanobacteria, the photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s-affected mutant 68 (Pam68) is important for PSII assembly. However, its mechanisms of action remain unknown. Using a <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803 strain expressing Flag-tagged Pam68, we purified a large protein complex containing ribosomes, SecY translocase, and the chlorophyll-binding PSII inner antenna CP47. Using 2D gel electrophoresis, we identified a pigmented Pam68-CP47 subcomplex and found Pam68 bound to ribosomes. Our results show that Pam68 binds to ribosomes even in the absence of CP47 translation. Furthermore, Pam68 associates with CP47 at an early phase of its biogenesis and promotes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of this chlorophyll-binding polypeptide until the attachment of the small PSII subunit PsbH. Deletion of both Pam68 and PsbH nearly abolishes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of CP47, which can be restored by enhancing chlorophyll bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. These results strongly suggest that ribosome-bound Pam68 stabilizes membrane segments of CP47 and facilitates the insertion of chlorophyll molecules into the translated CP47 polypeptide chain.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>zed via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s is directly related to photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

Mechanisms of Phosphorus Acquisition and Lipid Class Remodeling under P Limitation in a Marine Microalga
<p>Molecular mechanisms of phosphorus (P) limitation are of great interest for understanding algal production in aquatic ecosystems. Previous studies point to P limitation-induced changes in lipid composition. As, in microalgae, the molecular mechanisms of this specific P stress adaptation remain unresolved, we reveal a detailed phospholipid-recycling scheme in <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i> and describe important P acquisition genes based on highly corresponding transcriptome and lipidome data. Initial responses to P limitation showed increased expression of genes involved in P uptake and an expansion of the P substrate spectrum based on purple acid phosphatases. Increase in P trafficking displayed a rearrangement between compartments by supplying P to the chloroplast and carbon to the cytosol for lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. We propose a novel phospholipid-recycling scheme for algae that leads to the rapid reduction of phospholipids and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of the P-free lipid classes. P mobilization through membrane lipid degradation is mediated mainly by two glycerophosphoryldiester phosphodiesterases and three patatin-like phospholipases A on the transcriptome level. To compensate for low phospholipids in exponential growth, <i>N. oceanica</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>zed sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol and diacylglyceroltrimethylhomoserine. In this study, it was shown that an <i>N. oceanica</i> strain has a unique repertoire of genes that facilitate P acquisition and the degradation of phospholipids compared with other stramenopiles. The novel phospholipid-recycling scheme opens new avenues for metabolic engineering of lipid composition in algae.</p>

Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its concentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar concentration to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages conferred by both of these symplastic-loading processes. Here, we present an integrated model—including local and global transport and kinetics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization—for passive and active symplastic loading. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to passive loading, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates export for a given concentration of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>s are allowed to diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of active and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

Determining the Site of Action of Strigolactones during Nodulation
<p>Strigolactones (SLs) influence the ability of legumes to associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. In this study, we determine the precise stage at which SLs influence nodulation. We show that SLs promote infection thread formation, as a null SL-deficient pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) mutant forms significantly fewer infection threads than wild-type plants, and this reduction can be overcome by the application of the synthetic SL GR24. We found no evidence that SLs influence physical events in the plant before or after infection thread formation, since SL-deficient plants displayed a similar ability to induce root hair curling in response to rhizobia or Nod lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) and SL-deficient nodules appear to fix nitrogen at a similar rate to those of wild-type plants. In contrast, an SL receptor mutant displayed no decrease in infection thread formation or nodule number, suggesting that SL deficiency may influence the bacterial partner. We found that this influence of SL deficiency was not due to altered flavonoid exudation or the ability of root exudates to stimulate bacterial growth. The influence of SL deficiency on infection thread formation was accompanied by reduced expression of some early nodulation genes. Importantly, SL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s is down-regulated by mutations in genes of the Nod LCO signaling pathway, and this requires the downstream transcription factor <i>NSP2</i> but not <i>NIN</i>. This, together with the fact that the expression of certain SL bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s genes can be elevated in response to rhizobia/Nod LCOs, suggests that Nod LCOs may induce SL bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. SLs appear to influence nodulation independently of ethylene action, as SL-deficient and ethylene-insensitive double mutant plants display essentially additive phenotypes, and we found no evidence that SLs influence ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s or vice versa.</p>

Leaf Starch Turnover Occurs in Long Days and in Falling Light at the End of the Day
<p>We investigated whether starch degradation occurs at the same time as starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves in the light. Starch accumulated in a linear fashion for about 12 h after dawn, then accumulation slowed and content plateaued. Following decreases in light intensity, the rate of accumulation of starch declined in proportion to the decline in photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s if the decrease occurred <10 h after dawn, but accumulation ceased or loss of starch occurred if the same decrease in light intensity was imposed more than 10 h after dawn. These changes in starch accumulation patterns after prolonged periods in the light occurred at both high and low starch contents and were not related to time-dependent changes in either the rate of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s or the partitioning of assimilate between starch and Suc, as assessed from metabolite measurements and <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> pulse experiments. Instead, measurements of incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C from <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> into starch and of levels of the starch degradation product maltose showed that substantial starch degradation occurred simultaneously with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s at time points >14 h after dawn and in response to decreases in light intensity that occurred >10 h after dawn. Starch measurements in circadian clock mutants suggested that the clock influences the timing of onset of degradation. We conclude that the propensity for leaf starch to be degraded increases with time after dawn. The importance of this phenomenon for efficient use of carbon for growth in long days and for prevention of starvation during twilight is discussed.</p>

Two Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases from <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Have Distinct Roles in Lipid Metabolism
<p>The metabolism of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is important for environmental stress responses by eukaryotic microalgae. G3P is an essential precursor for glycerolipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in response to nutrient starvation. G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH) mediates G3P <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, but the roles of specific GPDH isoforms are currently poorly understood. Of the five GPDH enzymes in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> were shown to be induced by nutrient starvation and/or salt stress. Heterologous expression of GPD2, a putative chloroplastic GPDH, and GPD3, a putative cytosolic GPDH, in a yeast <i>gpd1</i>Δ mutant demonstrated the functionality of both enzymes. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> knockdown mutants for <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> showed no difference in growth but displayed significant reduction in TAG concentration compared with the wild type in response to phosphorus or nitrogen starvation. Overexpression of <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> gave distinct phenotypes. <i>GPD2</i> overexpression lines showed only subtle metabolic phenotypes and no significant alteration in growth. In contrast, <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines displayed significantly inhibited growth and chlorophyll concentration, reduced glycerol concentration, and changes to lipid composition compared with the wild type, including increased abundance of phosphatidic acids but reduced abundance of diglycerides, triglycerides, and phosphatidylglycerol lipids. This may indicate a block in the downstream glycerolipid metabolism pathway in <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines. Thus, lipid engineering by GPDH modification may depend on the activities of other downstream enzyme steps. These results also suggest that GPD2 and GPD3 GPDH isoforms are important for nutrient starvation-induced TAG accumulation but have distinct metabolic functions.</p>

A Key Role for Apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Norway Spruce Phenolic Metabolism
<p>Apoplastic events such as monolignol oxidation and lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization are difficult to study in intact trees. To investigate the role of apoplastic hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in gymnosperm phenolic metabolism, an extracellular lignin-forming cell culture of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) was used as a research model. Scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by potassium iodide repressed lignin formation, in line with peroxidases activating monolignols for lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization. Time-course analyses coupled to candidate substrate-product pair network propagation revealed differential accumulation of low-molecular-weight phenolics, including (glycosylated) oligolignols, (glycosylated) flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins, in lignin-forming and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging cultures and supported that monolignols are oxidatively coupled not only in the cell wall but also in the cytoplasm, where they are coupled to other monolignols and proanthocyanidins. Dilignol glycoconjugates with reduced structures were found in the culture medium, suggesting that cells are able to transport glycosylated dilignols to the apoplast. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in remodulation of the transcriptome, with reduced carbon flux into the shikimate pathway propagating down to monolignol bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. Aggregated coexpression network analysis identified candidate enzymes and transcription factors for monolignol oxidation and apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in addition to potential H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> receptors. The results presented indicate that the redox state of the apoplast has a profound influence on cellular metabolism.</p>

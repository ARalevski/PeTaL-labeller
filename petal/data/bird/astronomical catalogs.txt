A new morphological classification for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus
<p>In this study, we describe a morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication   for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus. We divided   these fractures into three types: avulsion, split and depression.   We retrospectively reviewed all shoulder radiographs showing isolated   greater tuberosity fractures in a Level I trauma centre between   July 2007 and July 2012. We identified 199 cases where records and   radiographs were reviewed and included 79 men and 120 women with   a mean age of 58 years (23 to 96). The morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication   was applied to the first 139 cases by three reviewers on two occasions   using the Kappa statistic and compared with the AO and Neer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ications.   The inter- and intra-observer reliability of the morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication   was 0.73 to 0.77 and 0.69 to 0.86, respectively. This was superior   to the Neer (0.31 to 0.35/0.54 to 0.63) and AO (0.30 to 0.32/0.59   to 0.65) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ications. The distribution of avulsion, split and   depression type fractures was 39%, 41%, and 20%, respectively. This   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication of greater tuberosity fractures is more reliable   than the Neer or AO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ications. These distinct fracture morphologies   are likely to have implications in terms of pathophysiology and   surgical technique.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:646–51.</p>

The use of the distal radius and ulna classification for the prediction of growth
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We report the use of the distal radius and ulna (DRU) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication   for the prediction of peak growth (PG) and growth cessation (GC)   in 777 patients with idiopathic scoliosis. We compare this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication   with other commonly used parameters of maturity.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The following data were extracted from the patients’ records   and radiographs: chronological age, body height (BH), arm span (AS),   date of menarche, Risser sign, DRU grade and status of the phalangeal   and metacarpal physes. The mean rates of growth were recorded according   to each parameter of maturity. PG was defined as the summit of the curve   and GC as the plateau in deceleration of growth.

Searching for hidden earthquakes in Southern California
<p>Earthquakes follow a well-known power-law size relation, with smaller events occurring much more often than larger events. Earthquake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalog</span></strong>s are thus dominated by small earthquakes yet are still missing a much larger number of even smaller events because of signal fidelity issues. To overcome these limitations, we applied a template-matching detection technique to the entire waveform archive of the regional seismic network in Southern California. This effort resulted in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalog</span></strong> with 1.81 million earthquakes, a 10-fold increase, which provides important insights into the geometry of fault zones at depth, foreshock behavior and nucleation processes, and earthquake-triggering mechanisms. The rich detail resolved in this type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalog</span></strong> will facilitate the next generation of analyses of earthquakes and faults.</p>

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ied according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ied by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication   system for fractures of the navicular that gives associated injuries   involving the lateral column due consideration. We have shown that   this system is reliable and reproducible and have described the   rationale for the subsequent treatment of each type.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:176–82.</p></sec>

All-optical machine learning using diffractive deep neural networks
<p>Deep learning has been transforming our ability to execute advanced inference tasks using computers. Here we introduce a physical mechanism to perform machine learning by demonstrating an all-optical diffractive deep neural network (D<sup>2</sup>NN) architecture that can implement various functions following the deep learning–based design of passive diffractive layers that work collectively. We created 3D-printed D<sup>2</sup>NNs that implement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication of images of handwritten digits and fashion products, as well as the function of an imaging lens at a terahertz spectrum. Our all-optical deep learning framework can perform, at the speed of light, various complex functions that computer-based neural networks can execute; will find applications in all-optical image analysis, feature detection, and object <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication; and will also enable new camera designs and optical components that perform distinctive tasks using D<sup>2</sup>NNs.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation
<p>Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is coproduced with ethylene in plant cells and is primarily enzymatically detoxified by the mitochondrial β-CYANOALANINE SYNTHASE (CAS-C1). Permanent or transient depletion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alterations in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in protein content, identifying 451 proteins that are absent or less abundant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 proteins that are only present or more abundant in <i>cas-c1</i>. Gene ontology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication of these proteins identified proteomic changes that explain the root hairless phenotype and the altered immune response observed in the <i>cas-c1</i> mutant. The mechanism of action of cyanide as a signaling molecule was addressed using two proteomic approaches aimed at identifying the <i>S-</i>cyanylation of Cys as a posttranslational modification of proteins. Both the 2-imino-thiazolidine chemical method and the direct untargeted analysis of proteins using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified a set of 163 proteins susceptible to <i>S-</i>cyanylation that included SEDOHEPTULOSE 1,7-BISPHOSPHATASE (SBPase), the PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE 20-3 (CYP20-3), and ENOLASE2 (ENO2). In vitro analysis of these enzymes showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation of SBPase Cys<sup>74</sup>, CYP20-3 Cys<sup>259</sup>, and ENO2 Cys<sup>346</sup> residues affected their enzymatic activity. Gene Ontology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication and protein-protein interaction cluster analysis showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation is involved in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, and the Calvin and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met cycles.</p>

Validity of Cardiovascular Data From Electronic Sources
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Understanding the validity of data from electronic data research networks is critical to national research initiatives and learning healthcare systems for cardiovascular care. Our goal was to evaluate the degree of agreement of electronic data research networks in comparison with data collected by standardized research approaches in a cohort study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We linked individual-level data from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a community-based cohort, with HealthLNK, a 2006 to 2012 database of electronic health records from 6 Chicago health systems. To evaluate the correlation and agreement of blood pressure in HealthLNK in comparison with in-person MESA examinations, and body mass index in HealthLNK in comparison with MESA, we used Pearson correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots. Using diagnoses in MESA as the criterion standard, we calculated the performance of HealthLNK for hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus diagnosis by using <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</i> codes and clinical data. We also identified potential myocardial infarctions, strokes, and heart failure events in HealthLNK and compared them with adjudicated events in MESA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 1164 MESA participants enrolled at the Chicago Field Center, 802 (68.9%) participants had data in HealthLNK. The correlation was low for systolic blood pressure (0.39; <i>P</i><0.0001). In comparison with MESA, HealthLNK overestimated systolic blood pressure by 6.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 4.2–7.8). There was a high correlation between body mass index in MESA and HealthLNK (0.94; <i>P</i><0.0001). HealthLNK underestimated body mass index by 0.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% confidence interval, –0.4 to –0.1). With the use of <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</i> codes and clinical data, the sensitivity and specificity of HealthLNK queries for hypertension were 82.4% and 59.4%, for obesity were 73.0% and 89.8%, and for diabetes mellitus were 79.8% and 93.3%. In comparison with adjudicated cardiovascular events in MESA, the concordance rates for myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure were, respectively, 41.7% (5/12), 61.5% (8/13), and 62.5% (10/16).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings illustrate the limitations and strengths of electronic data repositories in comparison with information collected by traditional standardized epidemiological approaches for the ascertainment of cardiovascular risk factors and events.</p></sec>

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal diagnosis, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical management for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for diseases affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention strategies to prevent the progression of disease in utero are also discussed. Recommendations for delivery planning strategies for fetuses with congenital heart disease including models based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication of disease severity and delivery room treatment will be highlighted.

Ghost cytometry
<p>Ghost imaging is a technique used to produce an object’s image without using a spatially resolving detector. Here we develop a technique we term “ghost cytometry,” an image-free ultrafast fluorescence “imaging” cytometry based on a single-pixel detector. Spatial information obtained from the motion of cells relative to a static randomly patterned optical structure is compressively converted into signals that arrive sequentially at a single-pixel detector. Combinatorial use of the temporal waveform with the intensity distribution of the random pattern allows us to computationally reconstruct cell morphology. More importantly, we show that applying machine-learning methods directly on the compressed waveforms without image reconstruction enables efficient image-free morphology-based cytometry. Despite a compact and inexpensive instrumentation, image-free ghost cytometry achieves accurate and high-throughput cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication and selective sorting on the basis of cell morphology without a specific biomarker, both of which have been challenging to accomplish using conventional flow cytometers.</p>

The dynamics of gene expression in vertebrate embryogenesis at single-cell resolution
<p>Time series of single-cell transcriptome measurements can reveal dynamic features of cell differentiation pathways. From measurements of whole frog embryos spanning zygotic genome activation through early organogenesis, we derived a detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalog</span></strong> of cell states in vertebrate development and a map of differentiation across all lineages over time. The inferred map recapitulates most if not all developmental relationships and associates new regulators and marker genes with each cell state. We find that many embryonic cell states appear earlier than previously appreciated. We also assess conflicting models of neural crest development. Incorporating a matched time series of zebrafish development from a companion paper, we reveal conserved and divergent features of vertebrate early developmental gene expression programs.</p>

The spread of true and false news online
<p>We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ied news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98% agreement on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.</p>

An integrated assessment of the vascular plant species of the Americas

We present an integrated assessment of all known native species of vascular plants in the Americas. Twelve regional and national checklists, prepared over the past 25 years and including two large ongoing flora projects, were merged into a single list. Our publicly searchable checklist includes 124,993 species, 6227 genera, and 355 families, which correspond to 33% of the 383,671 vascular plant species known worldwide. In the past 25 years, the rate at which new species descriptions are added has averaged 744 annually for the Americas, and we can expect the total to reach about 150,000.</p>

Quantized electric multipole insulators
<p>The Berry phase provides a modern formulation of electric polarization in crystals. We extend this concept to higher electric multipole moments and determine the necessary conditions and minimal models for which the quadrupole and octupole moments are topologically quantized electromagnetic observables. Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional topological phases. Furthermore, they host topologically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating phases of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to topological invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this topological behavior that can be immediately tested. Our work opens a venue for the expansion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication of topological phases of matter.</p>

Fault activation by hydraulic fracturing in western Canada
<p>Hydraulic fracturing has been inferred to trigger the majority of injection-induced earthquakes in western Canada, in contrast to the Midwestern United States, where massive saltwater disposal is the dominant triggering mechanism. A template-based earthquake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalog</span></strong> from a seismically active Canadian shale play, combined with comprehensive injection data during a 4-month interval, shows that earthquakes are tightly clustered in space and time near hydraulic fracturing sites. The largest event [moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>W</sub>) 3.9] occurred several weeks after injection along a fault that appears to extend from the injection zone into crystalline basement. Patterns of seismicity indicate that stress changes during operations can activate fault slip to an offset distance of >1 km, whereas pressurization by hydraulic fracturing into a fault yields episodic seismicity that can persist for months.</p>

RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2-Mediated Transcriptional Repression Regulates Vegetative and Reproductive Architecture
<p>Transcriptional repression in multicellular organisms orchestrates dynamic and precise gene expression changes that enable complex developmental patterns. Here, we present phenotypic and molecular characterization of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) transcriptional corepressor RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2 (REL2), a unique member of the highly conserved TOPLESS (TPL) family. Analysis of single recessive mutations in <i>rel2</i> revealed an array of vegetative and reproductive phenotypes, many related to defects in meristem initiation and maintenance. To better understand how REL2-mediated transcriptional complexes relate to <i>rel2</i> phenotypes, we performed protein interaction assays and transcriptional profiling of mutant inflorescences, leading to the identification of different maize transcription factors and regulatory pathways that employ REL2 repression to control traits directly impacting maize yields. In addition, we used our REL2 interaction data to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalog</span></strong> conserved repression motifs present on REL2 interactors and showed that two of these, RLFGV- and DLN-type motifs, interact with the C-terminal WD40 domain of REL2 rather than the N terminus, which is known to bind LxLxL EAR motifs. These findings establish that the WD40 domain of TPL family proteins is an independent protein interaction surface that may work together with the N-terminal domain to allow the formation of large macromolecular complexes of functionally related transcription factors.</p>

A New Phenotyping Pipeline Reveals Three Types of Lateral Roots and a Random Branching Pattern in Two Cereals
<p>Recent progress in root phenotyping has focused mainly on increasing throughput for genetic studies, while identifying root developmental patterns has been comparatively underexplored. We introduce a new phenotyping pipeline for producing high-quality spatiotemporal root system development data and identifying developmental patterns within these data. The SmartRoot image-analysis system and temporal and spatial statistical models were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Semi-Markov switching linear models were used to cluster lateral roots based on their growth rate profiles. These models revealed three types of lateral roots with similar characteristics in both species. The first type corresponds to fast and accelerating roots, the second to rapidly arrested roots, and the third to an intermediate type where roots cease elongation after a few days. These types of lateral roots were retrieved in different proportions in a maize mutant affected in auxin signaling, while the first most vigorous type was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication of growth rate profiles was mirrored by a ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential dependencies in the succession of lateral root types along the primary root were then analyzed using variable-order Markov chains. The lateral root type was not influenced by the shootward neighbor root type or by the distance from this root. This random branching pattern of primary roots was remarkably conserved, despite the high variability of root systems in both species. Our phenotyping pipeline opens the door to exploring the genetic variability of lateral root developmental patterns.</p>

PaCeQuant: A Tool for High-Throughput Quantification of Pavement Cell Shape Characteristics
<p>Pavement cells (PCs) are the most frequently occurring cell type in the leaf epidermis and play important roles in leaf growth and function. In many plant species, PCs form highly complex jigsaw-puzzle-shaped cells with interlocking lobes. Understanding of their development is of high interest for plant science research because of their importance for leaf growth and hence for plant fitness and crop yield. Studies of PC development, however, are limited, because robust methods are lacking that enable automatic segmentation and quantification of PC shape parameters suitable to reflect their cellular complexity. Here, we present our new ImageJ-based tool, PaCeQuant, which provides a fully automatic image analysis workflow for PC shape quantification. PaCeQuant automatically detects cell boundaries of PCs from confocal input images and enables manual correction of automatic segmentation results or direct import of manually segmented cells. PaCeQuant simultaneously extracts 27 shape features that include global, contour-based, skeleton-based, and PC-specific object descriptors. In addition, we included a method for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication and analysis of lobes at two-cell junctions and three-cell junctions, respectively. We provide an R script for graphical visualization and statistical analysis. We validated PaCeQuant by extensive comparative analysis to manual segmentation and existing quantification tools and demonstrated its usability to analyze PC shape characteristics during development and between different genotypes. PaCeQuant thus provides a platform for robust, efficient, and reproducible quantitative analysis of PC shape characteristics that can easily be applied to study PC development in large data sets.</p>

Changes in Anthocyanin Production during Domestication of <i>Citrus</i>
<p>Mandarin (<i>Citrus reticulata</i>), citron (<i>Citrus medica</i>), and pummelo (<i>Citrus maxima</i>) are important species of the genus <i>Citrus</i> and parents of the interspecific hybrids that constitute the most familiar commercial varieties of <i>Citrus</i>: sweet orange, sour orange, clementine, lemon, lime, and grapefruit. Citron produces anthocyanins in its young leaves and flowers, as do species in genera closely related to <i>Citrus</i>, but mandarins do not, and pummelo varieties that produce anthocyanins have not been reported. We investigated the activity of the <i>Ruby</i> gene, which encodes a MYB transcription factor controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis, in different accessions of a range of <i>Citrus</i> species and in domesticated cultivars. A white mutant of lemon lacks functional alleles of <i>Ruby</i>, demonstrating that <i>Ruby</i> plays an essential role in anthocyanin production in <i>Citrus</i>. Almost all the natural variation in pigmentation by anthocyanins in <i>Citrus</i> species can be explained by differences in activity of the <i>Ruby</i> gene, caused by point mutations and deletions and insertions of transposable elements. Comparison of the allelic constitution of <i>Ruby</i> in different species and cultivars also helps to clarify many of the taxonomic relationships in different species of <i>Citrus</i>, confirms the derivation of commercial varieties during domestication, elucidates the relationships within the subgenus <i>Papeda</i>, and allows a new genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication of mandarins.</p>

Nitric Oxide Modulates Histone Acetylation at Stress Genes by Inhibition of Histone Deacetylases
<p>Histone acetylation, which is an important mechanism to regulate gene expression, is controlled by the opposing action of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In animals, several HDACs are subjected to regulation by nitric oxide (NO); in plants, however, it is unknown whether NO affects histone acetylation. We found that treatment with the physiological NO donor <i>S</i>-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) increased the abundance of several histone acetylation marks in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), which was strongly diminished in the presence of the NO scavenger 2-4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide. This increase was likely triggered by NO-dependent inhibition of HDAC activity, since GSNO and <i>S</i>-nitroso-<i>N</i>-acetyl-<sc>dl</sc>-penicillamine significantly and reversibly reduced total HDAC activity in vitro (in nuclear extracts) and in vivo (in protoplasts). Next, genome-wide H3K9/14ac profiles in Arabidopsis seedlings were generated by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and changes induced by GSNO, GSNO/2-4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide or trichostatin A (an HDAC inhibitor) were quantified, thereby identifying genes that display putative NO-regulated histone acetylation. Functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication of these genes revealed that many of them are involved in the plant defense response and the abiotic stress response. Furthermore, salicylic acid, which is the major plant defense hormone against biotrophic pathogens, inhibited HDAC activity and increased histone acetylation by inducing endogenous NO production. These data suggest that NO affects histone acetylation by targeting and inhibiting HDAC complexes, resulting in the hyperacetylation of specific genes. This mechanism might operate in the plant stress response by facilitating the stress-induced transcription of genes.</p>

<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of seed traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, seed mass is generally regarded to be key for seedling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed seed size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single seeds, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i>Seeder, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual seeds of very different sizes. The system consists of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual seeds are two-dimensional data from projections, three-dimensional data from volumetric measures, and mass, from which seed density is also calculated. Each seed is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine seed-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating seeds of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped seeds of rapeseed, correlations between the projected area and the mass of seeds were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for seed mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated seed phenotyping on a single-seed basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication, seed sorting, and assessment of seed quality.</p>

The Repertoires of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Eukaryotic Genomes
<p>Reversible protein ubiquitination regulates virtually all known cellular activities. Here, we present a quantitatively evaluated and broadly applicable method to predict eukaryotic ubiquitinating enzymes (UBE) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) and its application to 50 distinct genomes belonging to four of the five major phylogenetic supergroups of eukaryotes: unikonts (including metazoans, fungi, choanozoa, and amoebozoa), excavates, chromalveolates, and plants. Our method relies on a collection of profile hidden Markov models, and we demonstrate its superior performance (coverage and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication accuracy >99%) by identifying approximately 25% and approximately 35% additional UBE and DUB genes in yeast and human, which had not been reported before. In yeast, we predict 85 UBE and 24 DUB genes, for 814 UBE and 107 DUB genes in the human genome. Most UBE and DUB families are present in all eukaryotic lineages, with plants and animals harboring massively enlarged repertoires of ubiquitin ligases. Unicellular organisms, on the other hand, typically harbor less than 300 UBEs and less than 40 DUBs per genome. Ninety-one UBE/DUB genes are orthologous across all four eukaryotic supergroups, and these likely represent a primordial core of enzymes of the ubiquitination system probably dating back to the first eukaryotes approximately 2 billion years ago. Our genome-wide predictions are available through the Database of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes (<ext-link>www.DUDE-db.org</ext-link>), where users can also perform advanced sequence and phylogenetic analyses and submit their own predictions.</p>

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s ability   to bear weight, but historically, operative fixation has been associated   with a high rate of re-operation.

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 components were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was a score of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring system and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular component.

Dislocation of a primary total hip arthroplasty is more common in patients with a lumbar spinal fusion
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Lumbar fusion is known to reduce the variation in pelvic tilt   between standing and sitting. A flexible lumbo-pelvic unit increases   the stability of total hip arthroplasty (THA) when seated by increasing   anterior clearance and acetabular anteversion, thereby preventing   impingement of the prosthesis. Lumbar fusion may eliminate this protective   pelvic movement. The effect of lumbar fusion on the stability of   total hip arthroplasty has not previously been investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The Medicare database was searched for patients who had undergone   THA and spinal fusion between 2005 and 2012. PearlDiver software   was used to query the database by the International Classification   of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedural   code for primary THA and lumbar spinal fusion. Patients who had   undergone both lumbar fusion and THA were then divided into three   groups: 1 to 2 levels, 3 to 7 levels and 8+ levels of fusion. The   rate of dislocation in each group was established using ICD-9-CM codes.   Patients who underwent THA without spinal fusion were used as a   control group. Statistical significant difference between groups   was tested using the chi-squared test, and significance set at p   < 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At one-year follow-up, 14 747 patients were found to have had   a THA after lumbar spinal fusion (12 079 1 to 2 levels, 2594 3 to   7 levels, 74 8+ levels). The control group consisted of 839 004   patients. The dislocation rate in the control group was 1.55%. A   higher rate of dislocation was found in patients with a spinal fusion   of 1 to 2 levels (2.96%, p < 0.0001) and 3 to 7 levels (4.12%,   p < 0.0001). Patients with 3 to 7 levels of fusion had a higher   rate of dislocation than patients with 1 to 2 levels of fusion (odds   ratio (OR) = 1.60, p < 0.0001). When groups were matched for   age and gender to the unfused cohort, patients with 1 to 2 levels   of fusion had an OR of 1.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to   2.32, p < 0.001), and those with 3 to 7 levels of fusion an OR   of 2.77 (CI 2.04 to 4.80, p < 0.001) for dislocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with a previous history of lumbar spinal fusion have   a significantly higher rate of dislocation of their THA than age-   and gender-matched patients without a lumbar spinal fusion.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:585–91.</p></sec>

Local bisphosphonate reduces migration and formation of radiolucent lines adjacent to cemented acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Post-operative migration of cemented acetabular components as   measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) has a strong predictive   power for late, aseptic loosening. Also, radiolucent lines predict   late loosening. Migration has been reduced by systemic bisphosphonate   treatment in randomised trials of hip and knee arthroplasty.

Defining modes of failure after joint-preserving surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Joint-preserving surgery of the hip (JPSH) has evolved considerably   and now includes a number of procedures, including arthroscopy,   surgical dislocation, and redirectional osteotomies of the femur   and acetabulum. There are a number of different factors which lead   to failure of JPSH. Consequently, it is of interest to assess the   various modes of failure in order to continue to identify best practice   and the indications for these procedures. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using a retrospective observational study design, we reviewed   1013 patients who had undergone JPSH by a single surgeon between   2005 and 2015. There were 509 men and 504 women with a mean age   of 39 years (16 to 78). Of the 1013 operations, 783 were arthroscopies,   122 surgical dislocations, and 108 peri-acetabular osteotomies (PAO).   We analysed the overall failure rates and modes of failure. Re-operations   were categorised into four groups: Mode 1 was arthritis progression   or organ failure leading to total hip arthroplasty (THA); Mode 2   was an Incorrect diagnosis/procedure; Mode 3 resulted from malcorrection   of femur (type A), acetabulum (type B), or labrum (type C) and Mode 4   resulted from an unintended consequence of the initial surgical   intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, there had been 104 re-operations   (10.2%) with a mean patient age of 35.5 years (17 to 64). There   were 64 Mode 1 failures (6.3%) at a mean of 3.2 years following   JPSH with a mean patient age of 46.8 years (18 to 64). There were   17 Mode 2 failures (1.7%) at a mean of 2.2 years post-JPSH with   a mean patient age of 28.9 years (17 to 42) (2% scopes; 1% surgical   dislocations). There were 19 Mode 3 failures (1.9%) at a mean of   2.0 years post-JPSH, with a mean patient age of 29.9 years (18 to   51) (2% scopes; 2% surgical dislocations; 5% PAO). There were 4   Mode 4 failures (0.4%) at a mean of 1.8 years post-JPSH with a mean   patient age of 31.5 years (15 to 43). Using the modified Dindo-Clavien   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication system, the overall complication rate among JPSHs   was 4.2%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While defining the overall re-operation and complication rates,   it is important to define the safety and effectiveness of JPSH.   Standardisation of the modes of failure may help identify the best   practice. Application of these modes to large clinical series, such   as registries, will assist in further establishing how to improve   the efficacy of JPSH.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:303–9.</p></sec>

Reconstruction with 3D-printed pelvic endoprostheses after resection of a pelvic tumour
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this retrospective study were to report the feasibility   of using 3D-printing technology for patients with a pelvic tumour   who underwent reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 35 patients underwent resection of a pelvic tumour   and reconstruction using 3D-printed endoprostheses between September   2013 and December 2015. According to Enneking’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication of   bone defects, there were three Type I lesions, 12 Type II+III lesions,   five Type I+II lesions, two Type I+II+III lesions, ten type I+II+IV   lesions and three type I+II+III+IV lesions. A total of three patients   underwent reconstruction using an iliac prosthesis, 12 using a standard   hemipelvic prosthesis and 20 using a screw-rod connected hemipelvic   prosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All patients had an <i>en bloc</i> resection. Margins   were wide in 15 patients, marginal in 14 and intralesional in six.   After a mean follow-up of 20.5 months (6 to 30), 25 patients survived   without evidence of disease, five were alive with disease and five   had died from metastatic disease. </p><p>Complications included seven patients with delayed wound healing   and two with a dislocation of the hip.

Correcting severe valgus deformity
<p>Valgus knee deformity can present a number of   unique surgical challenges for the total knee arthroplasty (TKA)   surgeon. Understanding the typical patterns of bone and soft-tissue pathology   in the valgus arthritic knee is critical for appropriate surgical   planning. This review aims to provide the knee arthroplasty surgeon   with an understanding of surgical management strategies for the   treatment of valgus knee arthritis.</p><p>Lateral femoral and tibial deficiencies, contracted lateral soft   tissues, attenuated medial soft tissues, and multiplanar deformities   may all be present in the valgus arthritic knee. A number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ications   have been reported in order to guide surgical management, and a variety   of surgical strategies have been described with satisfactory clinical   results. Depending on the severity of the deformity, a variety of   TKA implant designs may be appropriate for use.</p><p>Regardless of an operating surgeon’s preferred surgical strategy,   adherence to a step-wise approach to deformity correction is advised.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):60–4.</p>

Predictors of mortality following conservatively managed fractures of the odontoid in elderly patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Rates of mortality as high as 25% to 30% have been described   following fractures of the odontoid in the elderly population. The   aim of this study was to examine whether easily identifiable variables   present on admission are associated with mortality. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A consecutive series of 83 elderly patients with a fracture of   the odontoid following a low-impact injury was identified retrospectively.   Data that were collected included demographics, past medical history   and the results of blood tests on admission. Radiological investigations   were used to assess the Anderson and D’Alonzo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication and   displacement of the fracture. The mean age was 82.9 years (65 to   101). Most patients (66; 79.5%) had a type 2 fracture. An associated   neurological deficit was present in 11 (13.3%). All were treated   conservatively; 80 (96.4%) with a hard collar and three (3.6%) with   halo vest immobilisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The rate of mortality was 16% (13 patients) at 30 days and 24%   (20 patients) at one year after injury. A low serum level of haemoglobin   and the presence of a neurological deficit on admission were independent   predicators of mortality at 30 days on binary logistic regression   analysis. A, low level of haemoglobin, admission from an institution,   a neurological deficit and type 3 fractures were independent predictors   of mortality at one year. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We suggest that these easily identifiable predictors present   on admission can be used to identify patients at high risk and guide   management by a multidisciplinary team.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:116–21.</p></sec>

Clicky hip alone is not a true risk factor for developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A clicky hip is a common referral for clinical and sonographic   screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). There is   controversy regarding whether it represents a true risk factor for   pathological DDH. Therefore a 20-year prospective, longitudinal,   observational study was undertaken to assess the relationship between   the presence of a neonatal clicky hip and pathological DDH.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 362 infants from 1997 to 2016 were referred with clicky   hips to our ‘one-stop’ paediatric hip screening clinic. Hips were   assessed clinically for instability and by ultrasound imaging using   a simplified Graf/Harcke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication. Dislocated or dislocatable   hips were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ied as Graf Type IV hips.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at presentation was 13.8 weeks (12.8 to 14.7). In   all 351 out of 362 children (97.0%) had Graf Type I hips (normal)   that required no treatment. Nine children (2.5%) had Graf Type II   hips but all resolved to Graf Type I hips on follow-up scans. One   child (0.3%) had Graf Type III hip dysplasia and one child (0.3%)   had an irreducible hip dislocation. The two pathological hips were   associated with unilateral limited hip abduction. Mean referrals increased   from 12.9 to 23.3 each year (p = 0.002) from the first decade of   the study to the second, driven by increasing primary care referrals   (5.5 <i>versus</i> 16.7 per year, p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Most clicky hips required no treatment other than reassurance   to parents. Clicky hips with a normal hip examination should be   considered a variant of normal childhood and not a risk factor for   DDH. However, an abnormal hip examination including unilateral limited   hip abduction should prompt urgent further investigations.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1533–6.</p></sec>

Accuracy of CT-navigated pedicle screw positioning in the cervical and upper thoracic region with and without prior anterior surgery and ventral plating
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to retrospectively assess the accuracy and safety of   CT navigated pedicle screws and to compare accuracy in the cervical   and thoracic spine (C2-T8) with (COMB) and without (POST) prior   anterior surgery (anterior cervical discectomy or corpectomy and   fusion with ventral plating: ACDF/ACCF).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 592 pedicle screws, which were used in 107 consecutively   operated patients (210 COMB, 382 POST), were analysed. The accuracy   of positioning was determined according to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication of   Gertzbein and Robbins on post-operative CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>High accuracy was achieved in 524 screws (88.5%), 192 (87.7%)   in the cervical spine and 332 (89%) in the thoracic spine, respectively.   The results in the two surgical groups were compared and a logistic   regression mixed model was performed to analyse the risk of low   accuracy. Significantly lower accuracy was found in the COMB group   with 82.9% <i>versus</i> 91.6% in the POST group (p =   0.036). There were no neurological complications, but two vertebral artery   lesions were recorded. Three patients underwent revision surgery   for malpositioning of a screw. Although the risk of malpositioning   of a screw after primary anterior surgery was estimated to be 2.4-times   higher than with posterior surgery alone, the overall rates of complication   and revision were low.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We therefore conclude that CT navigated pedicle screws can be   positioned safely although greater caution must be taken in patients   who have previously undergone anterior surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1373–80.</p></sec>

Metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty is not associated with cardiac disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Many case reports and small studies have suggested that cobalt   ions are a potential cause of cardiac complications, specifically   cardiomyopathy, after metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasty   (THA). The impact of metal ions on the incidence of cardiac disease   after MoM THA has not been evaluated in large studies. The aim of   this study was to compare the rate of onset of new cardiac symptoms   in patients who have undergone MoM THA with those who have undergone   metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Data were extracted from the Standard Analytics Files database   for patients who underwent MoM THA between 2005 and 2012. Bearing   surface was selected using International Classification of Diseases   ninth revision codes. Patients with a minimum five-year follow-up   were selected. An age and gender-matched cohort of patients who underwent   MoP THA served as a comparison group. New diagnoses of cardiac disease   were collected during the follow-up period. Comorbidities and demographics   were identified and routine descriptive statistics were used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We identified 29 483 patients who underwent MoM THA and 24 175   matched patients who underwent MoP THA. Both groups had a mean Charlson   comorbidity index score of 4. There were no statistically significant   differences in 30 of 31 pre-existing comorbidities. Patients undergoing   MoM THA had a slightly lower incidence of cardiac failure compared   with those undergoing MoP THA at three years (6.60% <i>versus</i> 7.06%,   odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.99)   and four years (8.73% <i>versus</i> 9.49%, OR 0.91, 95%   CI 0.86 to 0.97) postoperatively, with no difference in the incidence   of new cardiac failure in between the groups at five years. There   was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of   arrhythmia, myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy at any time   between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MoM THA is not associated with cardiac complications. Initial   reports may have represented individual instances of cardiac disease   in patients with a failing MoM articulation rather than an emerging   epidemiological trend.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:28–32.</p></sec>

Trends in Hospitalizations and Survival of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure in Four US Communities (2005–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Community trends of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in diverse populations may differ by race and sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) sampled heart failure-related hospitalizations (≥55 years of age) in 4 US communities from 2005 to 2014 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. ADHF hospitalizations were validated by standardized physician review and computer algorithm, yielding 40 173 events after accounting for sampling design (unweighted n=8746).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the ADHF hospitalizations, 50% had reduced ejection fraction, and 39% had preserved EF (HFpEF). HF with reduced ejection fraction was more common in black men and white men, whereas HFpEF was most common in white women. Average age-adjusted rates of ADHF were highest in blacks (38.1 per 1000 black men, 30.5 per 1000 black women), with rates differing by HF type and sex. ADHF rates increased over the 10 years (average annual percentage change: black women +4.3%, black men +3.7%, white women +1.9%, white men +2.6%), mostly reflecting more acute HFpEF. Age-adjusted 28-day and 1-year case fatality proportions were ≈10% and 30%, respectively, similar across race-sex groups and HF types. Only blacks showed decreased 1-year mortality over time (average annual percentage change: black women –5.4%, black men –4.6%), with rates differing by HF type (average annual percentage change: black women HFpEF –7.1%, black men HF with reduced ejection fraction –4.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Between 2005 and 2014, trends in ADHF hospitalizations increased in 4 US communities, primarily driven by acute HFpEF.

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by birth year, sex, and county with 10 control subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden. Follow-up data were collected until 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 21 982 patients (51.6% men) with CHD and 219 816 matched control subjects, 654 and 328 developed AF, respectively. The mean follow-up was 27 years. The risk of developing AF was 21.99 times higher (95% confidence interval, 19.26–25.12) in patients with CHD than control subjects. According to a hierarchical CHD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication, patients with conotruncal defects had the highest risk (hazard ratio, 84.27; 95% confidence interval, 56.86–124.89). At the age of 42 years, 8.3% of all patients with CHD had a recorded diagnosis of AF. Heart failure was the quantitatively most important complication in patients with CHD and AF, with a 10.7% (70 of 654) recorded diagnosis of heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The risk of AF in children and young adults with CHD was 22 times higher than that in matched control subjects. Up to the age of 42 years, 1 of 12 patients with CHD had developed AF, and 1 of 10 patients with CHD with AF had developed heart failure. The patient groups with the most complex congenital defects carried the greatest risk of AF and could be considered for targeted monitoring.</p></sec>

Geographic Variation in Cardiac Rehabilitation Participation in Medicare and Veterans Affairs Populations
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation is strongly recommended after myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery, but it is historically underused. We sought to evaluate variation in cardiac rehabilitation participation across the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From administrative data from the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system and a 5% Medicare sample, we used International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes to identify patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery from 2007 to 2011. After excluding patients who died in ≤30 days of hospitalization, we calculated the percentage of patients who participated in ≥1 outpatient visits for cardiac rehabilitation during the 12 months after hospitalization. We estimated adjusted and standardized rates of participation in cardiac rehabilitation by state using hierarchical logistic regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, participation in cardiac rehabilitation was 16.3% (23 403/143 756) in Medicare and 10.3% (9123/88 826) in VA. However, participation rates varied widely across states, ranging from 3.2% to 41.8% in Medicare and 1.2% to 47.6% in VA. Similar regional variation was observed in both populations. Patients in the West North Central region (Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) had the highest participation, whereas those in the Pacific region (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington) had the lowest participation in both Medicare (33.7% versus 10.6%) and VA (16.6% versus 5.1%) populations. Significant hospital-level variation was also present, with participation ranging from 3% to 75% in Medicare and 1% to 43% in VA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation participation remains low overall in both Medicare and VA populations. However, remarkably similar regional variation exists, with some regions and hospitals achieving high rates of participation in both populations. This provides an opportunity to identify best practices from higher performing hospitals and regions that could be used to improve cardiac rehabilitation participation in lower performing hospitals and regions.</p></sec>

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based risk factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates adult lipid measures. We assessed and compared the utility of a risk model based solely on nonlaboratory risk factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory risk factors plus lipids for predicting high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study) and followed into adulthood when cIMT was measured (mean follow-up, 23.4 years). Overweight status was defined according to the Cole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-risk plasma lipid levels were defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Cholesterol Levels in Children. High cIMT was defined as a study-specific value ≥90th percentile. Age and sex were included in each model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In univariate models, all risk factors except for borderline high and high triglycerides in adolescence were associated with high cIMT in adulthood. In multivariable models (relative risk [95% confidence interval]), male sex (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) remained significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05). The addition of lipids into the nonlaboratory risk model slightly but significantly improved discrimination in predicting high cIMT compared with nonlaboratory-based risk factors only (C statistics for laboratory-based model 0.717 [95% confidence interval, 0.685–0.748] and for nonlaboratory 0.698 [95% confidence interval, 0.667–0.731]; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Nonlaboratory-based risk factors and lipids measured in adolescence independently predicted preclinical atherosclerosis in young adulthood. The addition of lipid measurements to traditional clinic-based risk factor assessment provided a statistically significant but clinically modest improvement on adolescent prediction of high cIMT in adulthood.</p></sec>

Risk for Major Bleeding in Patients Receiving Ticagrelor Compared With Aspirin After Transient Ischemic Attack or Acute Ischemic Stroke in the SOCRATES Study (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with minor acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are at high risk for subsequent stroke, and more potent antiplatelet therapy in the acute setting is needed. However, the potential benefit of more intense antiplatelet therapy must be assessed in relation to the risk for major bleeding. The SOCRATES trial (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes) was the first trial with ticagrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in which the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor were compared with those of aspirin. The main safety objective was assessment of PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes)–defined major bleeds on treatment, with special focus on intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>An independent adjudication committee blinded to study treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ied bleeds according to the PLATO, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction), and GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) definitions. The definitions of ICrH and major bleeding excluded cerebral microbleeds and asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of cerebral infarctions so that the definitions better discriminated important events in the acute stroke population.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 13 130 of 13 199 randomized patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the safety analysis set. PLATO major bleeds occurred in 31 patients (0.5%) on ticagrelor and 38 patients (0.6%) on aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–1.34). The most common locations of major bleeds were intracranial and gastrointestinal. ICrH was reported in 12 patients (0.2%) on ticagrelor and 18 patients (0.3%) on aspirin. Thirteen of all 30 ICrHs (4 on ticagrelor and 9 on aspirin) were hemorrhagic strokes, and 4 (2 in each group) were symptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of brain infarctions. The ICrHs were spontaneous in 6 and 13, traumatic in 3 and 3, and procedural in 3 and 2 patients on ticagrelor and aspirin, respectively. In total, 9 fatal bleeds occurred on ticagrelor and 4 on aspirin. The composite of ICrH or fatal bleeding included 15 patients on ticagrelor and 18 on aspirin. Independently of bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication, PLATO, TIMI, or GUSTO, the relative difference between treatments for major/severe bleeds was similar. Nonmajor bleeds were more common on ticagrelor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack showed a bleeding profile similar to that of aspirin for major bleeds. There were few ICrHs.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>. Unique identifier: NCT01994720.</p></sec>

Body Mass Index and Mortality Among Adults Undergoing Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In an apparent paradox, morbidity and mortality are lower in obese patients undergoing cardiac surgery, although the nature of this association is unclear. We sought to determine whether the obesity paradox observed in cardiac surgery is attributable to reverse epidemiology, bias, or confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the National Adult Cardiac Surgery registry for all cardiac surgical procedures performed between April 2002 and March 2013 were extracted. A parallel systematic review and meta-analysis (MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library) through June 2015 were also accomplished. Exposure of interest was body mass index categorized into 6 groups according to the World Health Organization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 401 227 adult patients in the cohort study and 557 720 patients in the systematic review were included. A U-shaped association between mortality and body mass index classes was observed in both studies, with lower mortality in overweight (adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.83) and obese class I and II (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.86; and odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.94) patients relative to normal-weight patients and increased mortality in underweight individuals (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.41–1.62). In the cohort study, a U-shaped relationship was observed for stroke and low cardiac output syndrome but not for renal replacement therapy or deep sternal wound infection. Counter to the reverse epidemiology hypotheses, the protective effects of obesity were less in patients with severe chronic renal, lung, or cardiac disease and greater in older patients and in those with complications of obesity, including the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. Adjustments for important confounders did not alter our results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Obesity is associated with lower risks after cardiac surgery, with consistent effects noted in multiple analyses attempting to address residual confounding and reverse causation.</p></sec>

Favorable Cardiovascular Health, Compression of Morbidity, and Healthcare Costs
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We examined the association of cardiovascular health at younger ages with the proportion of life lived free of morbidity, the cumulative burden of morbidity, and average healthcare costs at older ages.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The CHA study (Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry) is a longitudinal cohort of employed men and women 18 to 74 years of age at baseline examination in 1967 to 1973. Baseline measurements included blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, and smoking. Individuals were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ied into 1 of 4 strata of cardiovascular health: favorable levels of all factors, 0 factors high but ≥1 elevated risk factors, 1 high risk factor, and ≥2 high risk factors. Linked Medicare and National Death Index data from 1984 to 2010 were used to determine morbidity in older age. An individual’s all-cause morbidity score and cardiovascular morbidity score were calculated from <i>International <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication of Disease, Ninth Revision</i> codes for each year of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 25 804 participants who became ≥65 years of age by 2010, representing 65% of all original CHA participants (43% female; 90% white; mean age, 44 years at baseline); 6% had favorable levels of all factors, 19% had ≥1 risk factors at elevated levels, 40% had 1 high risk factor, and 35% had ≥2 high risk factors. Favorable cardiovascular health at younger ages extended survival by almost 4 years and postponed the onset of all-cause and cardiovascular morbidity by 4.5 and 7 years, respectively, resulting in compression of morbidity in both absolute and relative terms. This translated to lower cumulative and annual healthcare costs for those in favorable cardiovascular health (<i>P</i><0.001) during Medicare eligibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Individuals in favorable cardiovascular health in early middle age live a longer, healthier life free of all types of morbidity. These findings provide strong support for prevention efforts earlier in life aimed at preserving cardiovascular health and reducing the burden of disease in older ages.</p></sec>

Importance of Assessing Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Clinical Practice: A Case for Fitness as a Clinical Vital Sign: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>Mounting evidence has firmly established that low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, and mortality rates attributable to various cancers. A growing body of epidemiological and clinical evidence demonstrates not only that CRF is a potentially stronger predictor of mortality than established risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, but that the addition of CRF to traditional risk factors significantly improves the re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication of risk for adverse outcomes. The purpose of this statement is to review current knowledge related to the association between CRF and health outcomes, increase awareness of the added value of CRF to improve risk prediction, and suggest future directions in research. Although the statement is not intended to be a comprehensive review, critical references that address important advances in the field are highlighted. The underlying premise of this statement is that the addition of CRF for risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication presents health professionals with unique opportunities to improve patient management and to encourage lifestyle-based strategies designed to reduce cardiovascular risk. These opportunities must be realized to optimize the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and hence meet the American Heart Association’s 2020 goals.</p>

Lipidomics Profiling and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in the Prospective Population-Based Bruneck Study
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The bulk of cardiovascular disease risk is not explained by traditional risk factors. Recent advances in mass spectrometry allow the identification and quantification of hundreds of lipid species. Molecular lipid profiling by mass spectrometry may improve cardiovascular risk prediction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Lipids were extracted from 685 plasma samples of the prospective population-based Bruneck Study (baseline evaluation in 2000). One hundred thirty-five lipid species from 8 different lipid classes were profiled by shotgun lipidomics with the use of a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Levels of individual species of cholesterol esters (CEs), lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), sphingomyelins, and triacylglycerols (TAGs) were associated with cardiovascular disease over a 10-year observation period (2000–2010, 90 incident events). Among the lipid species with the strongest predictive value were TAGs and CEs with a low carbon number and double-bond content, including TAG(54:2) and CE(16:1), as well as PE(36:5) (<i>P</i>=5.1×10<sup>−7</sup>, 2.2×10<sup>−4</sup>, and 2.5×10<sup>−3</sup>, respectively). Consideration of these 3 lipid species on top of traditional risk factors resulted in improved risk discrimination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication for cardiovascular disease (cross-validated ΔC index, 0.0210 [95% confidence interval, 0.0010-0.0422]; integrated discrimination improvement, 0.0212 [95% confidence interval, 0.0031-0.0406]; and continuous net re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classif</span></strong>ication index, 0.398 [95% confidence interval, 0.175-0.619]). A similar shift in the plasma fatty acid composition was associated with cardiovascular disease in the UK Twin Registry (n=1453, 45 cases).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>This study applied mass spectrometry-based lipidomics profiling to population-based cohorts and identified molecular lipid signatures for cardiovascular disease. Molecular lipid species constitute promising new biomarkers that outperform the conventional biochemical measurements of lipid classes currently used in clinics.</p></sec>

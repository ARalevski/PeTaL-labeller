The medium- and long-term outcome of total shoulder arthroplasty for primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis in middle-aged patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Promising medium-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> results from total shoulder arthroplasty   (TSA) have been reported for the treatment of primary osteoarthritis   in young and middle-aged patients. The aim of this study was to   evaluate the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> functional and radiological outcome of TSA   in the middle-aged patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The data of all patients from the previous medium-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> study   were available. At a mean follow-up of 13 years (8 to 17), we reviewed   21 patients (12 men, nine women, 21 shoulders) with a mean age of   55 years (37 to 60). The Constant-Murley score (CS) with its subgroups   and subjective satisfaction were measured. Radiological signs of implant   loosening were analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Two shoulders (two patients) were revised and in two shoulders   of two different patients, revision surgery was recommended. The   mean CS increased from 23.3 (10 to 45) pre-operatively to 56.5 (26   to 81; p < 0.0001), but with a decrease in CS from 62.8 (38 to   93) to 56.5 (26 to 81) between medium- and long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> follow-up (p   = 0.01). Without revision surgery, 18 patients (95%) rated their   result as good or very good.</p><p>The mean radiolucent line score for the glenoid components increased   from 1.8 (0 to 6) to 8.2 (2 to 18) between medium- and long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>   follow-up (p < 0.001). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TSA in young and middle-aged patients leads to improvement in   clinical function and a relatively high satisfaction rate. However,   clinical or radiological glenoid loosening worsens in the long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>.   Further studies are needed to optimise the treatment options in   this patient population.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:939–43.</p></sec>

Long-term survival and risk factors for failure of the native hip joint after operatively treated displaced acetabular fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim in this study was to describe the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival   of the native hip joint after open reduction and internal fixation   of a displaced fracture of the acetabulum. We also present long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>   clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with a poor outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 285 patients underwent surgery for a displaced acetabular   fracture between 1993 and 2005. For the survival analysis 253 were   included, there were 197 men and 56 women with a mean age of 42   years (12 to 78). The mean follow-up of 11 years (1 to 20) was identified   from our pelvic fracture registry. There were 99 elementary and 154   associated fracture types. For the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> clinical follow-up,   192 patients with complete data were included. Their mean age was   40 years (13 to 78) with a mean follow-up of 12 years (5 to 20).   Injury to the femoral head and acetabular impaction were assessed   with CT scans and patients with an ipsilateral fracture of the femoral   head were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 patients underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA).   The overall ten-year survival of the hip joint was 86% (95% confidence   interval (CI) 81% to 90%) and the 20-year survival was 82% (95%   CI 76% to 87%). Injury to the femoral head and acetabular impaction   were the strongest predictors of failure, with the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival   rate falling towards 50% in these patients. The survival fell to   0% at three years when both these risk factors were present in patients   aged > 60 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival of the native hip joint after acetabular   fractures was good, but the presence of injury to the femoral head   and acetabular impaction proved to be strong predictors of failure,   especially in patients aged > 60 years. These patients may be better   treated with a combination of open reduction and internal fixation   and primary arthroplasty.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:834–40.</p></sec>

Association Between Fetal Congenital Heart Defects and Maternal Risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in the Same Pregnancy and Across Pregnancies
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both pregnant women carrying fetuses with heart defects and women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy often exhibit angiogenic imbalances, suggesting that the same mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of the former and the pathophysiology of the latter. We conducted a register-based cohort study to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>ine whether offspring congenital heart defects are associated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and whether the mechanisms driving any association are primarily maternal or fetal.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among singleton pregnancies without chromosomal abnormalities lasting ≥20 weeks in Denmark from 1978 to 2011 (n= 1 972 857), we identified pregnancies complicated by offspring congenital heart defects or early pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia, late pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension. We used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for associations between offspring congenital heart defects and maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy overall and for specific heart defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Offspring congenital heart defects were strongly associated with early pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia (OR, 7.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.11–8.03) and late pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.38–3.34) in the same pregnancy and weakly associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06–1.27), but they were not associated with gestational hypertension (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25). Association strengths were consistent across heart defect types. Offspring congenital heart defects in a previous pregnancy were also strongly associated with pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies (early pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia: OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.68–3.34; late pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia: OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.52–2.75) but were only modestly associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia and not associated with gestational hypertension. Similarly, pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, but not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, was associated with offspring congenital heart defects in later pregnancies (early pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia: OR, 7.91; 95% CI, 6.06–10.3; late pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia: OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.11–3.79; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia: OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88–1.10; gestational hypertension: OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92–1.38).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Linked pathophysiological mechanisms may be involved in some congenital heart defects and pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> preeclampsia. The strong associations across pregnancies support a predominantly maternal origin of effect.</p></sec>

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often estimated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine samples on the relation between sodium intake and long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine sample between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection during a 17-year follow-up. Sodium intake was estimated with a single baseline collection and the average of samples collected during a 1-, 5-, and 15-year follow-up. We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine samples. Average age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. Average 24-hour sodium excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88). However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> estimations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year average was used, respectively. Consequently, hazard ratios for cardiorenal outcome changed up to 85% with the use of sodium intake estimations from short-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> (1-year) and long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> (5-year) follow-up instead of baseline estimations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Relative to a single baseline 24-hour sodium measurement, the use of subsequent 24-hour urine samples resulted in different estimations of an individual’s sodium intake, whereas population averages remained similar. This finding had significant consequences for the association between sodium intake and long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> cardiovascular and renal outcomes.</p></sec>

Three Arterial Grafts Improve Late Survival
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little evidence shows whether a third arterial graft provides superior outcomes compared with the use of 2 arterial grafts in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. A meta-analysis of all the propensity score-matched observational studies comparing the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting with the use of 2-arterial versus 3-arterial grafts was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science to identify relevant articles. Long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> mortality in the propensity score-matched populations was the primary end point. Secondary end points were in-hospital/30-day mortality for the propensity score-matched populations and long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> mortality for the unmatched populations. In the matched population, time-to-event outcome for long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> mortality was extracted as hazard ratios, along with their variance. Statistical pooling of survival (time-to-event) was performed according to a random effect model, computing risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight propensity score-matched studies reporting on 10 287 matched patients (2-arterial graft: 5346; 3-arterial graft: 4941) were selected for final comparison. The mean follow-up time ranged from 37.2 to 196.8 months. The use of 3 arterial grafts was not statistically associated with early mortality (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–1.22; <i>P</i>=0.62). The use of 3 arterial grafts was associated with statistically significantly lower hazard for late death (hazard ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.87; <i>P</i><0.001), irrespective of sex and diabetic mellitus status. This result was qualitatively similar in the unmatched population (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.04).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The use of a third arterial conduit in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting is not associated with higher operative risk and is associated with superior long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival, irrespective of sex and diabetic mellitus status.</p></sec>

Does a less intensive surveillance protocol affect the survival of patients after treatment of a sarcoma of the limb?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A single-centre prospective randomized trial was conducted to   investigate whether a less intensive follow-up protocol would not   be inferior to a conventional follow-up protocol, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>s of overall   survival, in patients who have undergone surgery for sarcoma of   the limb. Initial short-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> results were published in 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The primary objective was to show non-inferiority of a chest   radiograph (CXR) group compared with a CT scan group, and of a less   frequent (six-monthly) group than a more frequent (three-monthly)   group, in two-by-two comparison. The primary outcome was overall   survival and the secondary outcome was a recurrence-free survival.   Five-year survival was compared between the CXR and CT scan groups   and between the three-monthly and six-monthly groups. Of 500 patients   who were enrolled, 476 were available for follow-up. Survival analyses   were performed on a per-protocol basis (n = 412).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The updated results recorded 12 (2.4%) local recurrences, 182   (36.8%) metastases, and 56 (11.3%) combined (local + metastases)   recurrence at a median follow-up of 81 months (60 to 118). Of 68   local recurrences, 60 (88%) were identified by the patients themselves.   The six-monthly regime (overall survival (OS) 54%, recurrence-free   survival (RFS) 46%) did not lead to a worse survival and was not   inferior to the three-monthly regime (OS 55%, RFS 47%) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>s   of detecting recurrence.

Long-Term Survival of Patients With Radiation Heart Disease Undergoing Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Thoracic radiation results in radiation-associated heart disease (RAHD), often requiring cardiothoracic surgery (CTS). We sought to measure long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival in RAHD patients undergoing CTS, to compare them with a matched control population undergoing similar surgical procedures, and to identify potential predictors of long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>In this retrospective observational cohort study of patients undergoing CTS, matched on the basis of age, sex, and type/time of CTS, 173 RAHD patients (75% women; age, 63±14 years) and 305 comparison patients (74% women; age, 63±4 years) were included. The vast majority of RAHD patients had prior breast cancer (53%) and Hodgkin lymphoma (27%), and the mean time from radiation was 18±12 years. Clinical and surgical parameters were recorded. The preoperative EuroSCORE and all-cause mortality were recorded. The mean EuroSCOREs were similar in the RAHD and comparison groups (7.8±3 versus 7.4±3, respectively; <i>P</i>=0.1). Proximal coronary artery disease was higher in patients with RAHD versus the comparison patients (45% versus 38%; <i>P</i>=0.09), whereas redo CTS was lower in the RACD versus the comparison group (20% versus 29%; <i>P</i>=0.02). About two thirds of patients in either group had combination surgical procedures. During a mean follow-up of 7.6±3 years, a significantly higher proportion of patients died in the RAHD group than in the comparison group (55% versus 28%; <i>P</i><0.001). On multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, RAHD (2.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.82–3.36), increasing EuroSCORE (1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.16–1.29), and lack of β-blockers (0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.47–0.93) were associated with increased mortality (all <i>P</i><0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>In patients undergoing CTS, RAHD portends increased long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> mortality. Alternative treatment strategies may be required in RAHD to improve long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival.</p></sec>

Effect of Race and Ethnicity on Outcomes With Drug-Eluting and Bare Metal Stents
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients have been underrepresented in percutaneous coronary intervention clinical trials; therefore, there are limited data available on outcomes for these race/ethnicity groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined outcomes in 423 965 patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry database linked to Medicare claims for follow-up. Within each race/ethnicity group, we examined trends in drug-eluting stent (DES) use, 30-month outcomes, and relative outcomes of DES versus bare metal stents. Overall, 390 351 white, 20 191 black, 9342 Hispanic, and 4171 Asian patients > 65 years of age underwent stent implantation from 2004 through 2008 at 940 National Cardiovascular Data Registry participating sites.

Energy pulses reveal possible new state of memory
<p>Memory researchers have shone light into a cognitive limbo. A new memory—the name of someone you've just met, for example—is held for seconds in so-called working memory, as your brain's neurons continue to fire. If the person is important to you, the name will over a few days enter your long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> memory, preserved by permanently altered neural connections. But where does it go during the in-between hours, when it has left your standard working memory and is not yet embedded in long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> memory? To figure this out, a research team resurrects memories from this limbo. Their observations point to a new form of working memory, which they dub prioritized long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> memory, that exists without elevated neural activity. Consistent with other recent work, the study suggests that information can somehow be held among the synapses that connect neurons, even after conventional working memory has faded. This new memory state could have a range of practical implications, from helping college students learn more efficiently to assisting people with memory-related neurological conditions such as amnesia, epilepsy, and schizophrenia.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Biotin Attachment Domain-Containing Proteins Irreversibly Inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
<p>The first committed step in fatty acid synthesis is mediated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), a biotin-dependent enzyme that carboxylates acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> or long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> exposure to fatty acids in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly containing oleic acid), which results in reversible or irreversible ACCase inhibition, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin carboxyl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporation into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-containing) biotin carboxyltransferase protein subunits. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines containing T-DNA insertions in <i>BADC1</i>, <i>BADC2</i>, and <i>BADC3</i> were used to generate <i>badc1 badc2</i> and <i>badc1 badc3</i> double mutants. The <i>badc1 badc3</i> mutant exhibited normal growth and development; however, ACCase activity was 26% higher in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and its seeds contained 30.1% more fatty acids and 32.6% more triacylgycerol relative to wild-type plants. To assess whether BADC contributes to the irreversible phase of ACCase inhibition, cell suspension cultures were generated from the leaves of <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type plants and treated with 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tween 80. Reversible ACCase inhibition was similar in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type cultures after 2 d of Tween 80 treatment, but irreversible inhibition was reduced by 50% in <i>badc1 badc3</i> relative to wild-type plants following 4 d of Tween 80 treatment. In this study, we present evidence for two important homeostatic roles for BADC proteins in down-regulating ACCase activity: by acting during normal growth and development and by contributing to its long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> irreversible feedback inhibition resulting from the oversupply of fatty acids.</p>

The indication for further surgery, range of movement, mean Mayo   Elbow Performance (MEP) score, quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (quickDASH) score, osteolysis and positioning of the implant   were also assessed according to the design, and acute or delayed   use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean MEP and quickDASH scores were 90.2 (<sc>sd</sc> 14;   45 to 100), and 14.0 points (<sc>sd</sc> 12; 1.2 to 52.5), respectively. There   were no significant differences between RHA performed in acute or   delayed fashion. There were 30 re-operations (19 with, and 11 without   removal of the implant) during the first three post-operative years.

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To assess the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> effect of distal trochanteric transfer   (DTT) on the clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients with   Legg-Calvé-Perthes’ disease (LCPD) following a varus derotational   osteotomy (VDRO).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>For this single centre cross-sectional retrospective study we   analysed the data of 22 patients (24 hips) with LCPD who had greater   trochanteric overgrowth (GTO), following a VDRO performed in our   institution between 1959 and 1983. GTO was defined as an articular   trochanteric distance (ATD) of < 5 mm. We compared the radiographic   and clinical outcomes of patients who underwent DTT for GTO (ten   patients, ten hips) with those who did not (12 patients, 14 hips).   Age at presentation was 6.9 years (4 to 10) and 8.0 years (3.2 to   12) respectively. Symptoms associated with the hip and general quality   of life were assessed using the Harris hip score (HHS) and the Short Form   (SF)-36 questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> follow-up of the DTT group, the ATD was 21.7 mm   (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 9.8) and the centro-trochanteric   distance (CTD) was 13.8 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 8.3). In the control group   the ATD was -0.6 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 7.8) and the CTD was 32.5 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 10.2).   These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001).   The mean HHS and SF-36 scores were 68.4 (<sc>sd</sc> 25.0) and 62.0   (<sc>sd</sc> 27.7) for the DTT group and 73.2 (<sc>sd</sc> 24.2)   and 73.3 (<sc>sd</sc> 21.5) for the control group, respectively.   There was no statistically significant difference in the HHS (p   = 0.63) or SF-36 score (p = 0.25). There were four patients who   had undergone hip arthroplasty in the DTT group (40%) and one patient   (7.1%) in the control group (p = 0.07). The mean age at the time   of arthroplasty was 45.3 years (42.1 to 56.5) and 43.6 years respectively.

Outcomes after early return to theatre following hip hemiarthroplasty for intracapsular fracture of the femoral neck
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Hip hemiarthroplasty is a standard treatment for intracapsular   proximal femoral fractures in the frail elderly. In this study we   have explored the implications of early return to theatre, within   30 days, on patient outcome following hip hemiarthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of all hip hemiarthroplasties   performed in our unit between January 2010 and January 2015. Demographic   details, medical backround, details of the primary procedure, complications,   subsequent procedures requiring return to theatre, re-admissions,   discharge destination and death were collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 705 procedures were included; 428 Austin Moore and   277 Exeter Trauma Stems were used. A total of 34 fractures (in 33   patients) required early return to theatre within 30 days. Age,   gender, laterality, time from admission to primary procedure, American   Society of Anesthesiologists grade, and implant type were similar   for those requiring early return to theatre and those who did not.   Early return to theatre was associated with a significantly higher   length of stay (mean 33.6 days (7 to 107) <i>versus</i> 18.6   days (0 to 152), p < 0.001), re-admission rate (38.2% <i>versus</i> 8.6%,   p < 0.001), and subsequent revision rate (17.6% <i>versus</i> 1.3%,   p < 0.001). We found no difference in level of care required   on discharge or mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Proximal femoral fractures are common in the elderly population,   with far-reaching medical and economic implications. Factors such   as infection or dislocation may require early return to theatre,   and this is associated with outcomes which may be both medically   and economically detrimental. This illustrates the importance of   avoiding early complications to improve longer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> outcome.</p><p>Return to theatre within 30 days is associated with longer length   of stay, higher re-admission rate, and higher subsequent revision   rate. It may be a useful short-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> quality indicator for longer   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> outcome measures following hip hemiarthroplasty for intracapsular   fractures of the proximal femur.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:958–63.</p></sec>

Kudo type-5 total elbow arthroplasty for patients with rheumatoid arthritis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We assessed the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> (more than ten-year) outcomes of the   Kudo type-5 elbow prosthesis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis   (RA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 41 elbows (Larsen Grade IV, n = 21; Grade V, n =   20) in 31 patients with RA who had undergone a Kudo type-5 total   elbow arthroplasty (TEA) between 1994 and 2003, and had been followed   up for more than ten years. The humeral component was cementless   and the all-polyethylene ulnar component cemented in every patient. Clinical   outcome was assessed using the Mayo elbow performance score. We   calculated the revision rate and evaluated potential risk factors   for revision. The duration of follow-up was a mean 141 months (120   to 203).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Aseptic loosening of the ulnar component occurred in 11 elbows.   There was no radiolucency around any humeral component. There was   one deep infection. The survival rate according to Kaplan-Meier   survivorship analysis was 87.8% after five years and 70.7% after   ten years. The range of extension/flexion was a mean -38° (-80°   to 0°)/105° (30° to 150°) before surgery and -40° (-70° to -20°)/132°   (100° to 150°) at the final follow-up, while the mean Mayo elbow performance   score was 43 before surgery and 80 at final follow-up. Disease duration   of RA up to the TEA of < 15 years and a pre-operative range of   movement (ROM) of > 85° were significant risk factors for revision   or aseptic loosening.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although Kudo type-5 prostheses gave satisfactory results in   the short-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>, aseptic loosening increased after five years. In   most cases, elbow function was maintained in the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> without   loosening of the implant. A short duration from the onset of RA   to TEA and a large pre-operative ROM were significant risk factors   for revision or aseptic loosening.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:818–23.</p></sec>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>ine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal ions in the blood at mid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal ions in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluation)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> evaluation).   Changes in ion levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regression model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal ions   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per billion (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal ions was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relationship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The levels of metal ions in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   metal ions be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.   While those with a MoM THA appear to stabilise at a certain level,   the accuracy of this trend is not yet clear. Vigilant follow-up   is still recommended. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):33–40.</p></sec>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect development has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan development. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic development of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head development. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, developed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> development. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> imaging datasets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> fluorescence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

Hospital Variation in Adherence Rates to Secondary Prevention Medications and the Implications on Quality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Medication adherence is important to improve the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (MI). We hypothesized that there is significant variation among US hospitals in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>s of medication adherence after MI, and that patients treated at hospitals with higher medication adherence after MI will have better long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> cardiovascular outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified 19 704 Medicare patients discharged after acute MI from 347 US hospitals participating in the ACTION Registry-GWTG (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines) from January 2, 2007, to October 1, 2010. Using linked Medicare Part D prescription filling data, medication adherence was defined as proportion of days covered >80% within 90 days after discharge. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compare 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events among hospitals with high, moderate, and low 90-day medication adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By 90 days after MI, overall rates of adherence to medications prescribed at discharge were 68% for β-blockers, 63% for statins, 64% for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and 72% for thienopyridines. Adherence to these medications up to 90 days varied significantly among hospitals: β-blockers (proportion of days covered >80%; 59% to 75%), statins (55% to 69%), thienopyridines (64% to 77%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (57% to 69%). Compared with hospitals in the lowest quartile of 90-day composite medication adherence, hospitals with the highest adherence had lower unadjusted and adjusted 2-year major adverse cardiovascular event risk (27.5% versus 35.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.96). High-adherence hospitals also had lower adjusted rates of death or readmission (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.96), whereas there was no difference in mortality after adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of secondary prevention medications after discharge varies significantly among US hospitals and is inversely associated with 2-year outcomes. Hospitals may improve medication adherence after discharge and patient outcomes through better coordination of care between inpatient and outpatient settings.</p></sec>

Enhanced Therapeutic and Long-Term Dynamic Vascularization Effects of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Endothelial Cells Encapsulated in a Nanomatrix Gel
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)–derived endothelial cells (ECs) have limited clinical utility because of undefined components in the differentiation system and poor cell survival in vivo. Here, we aimed to develop a fully defined and clinically compatible system to differentiate hPSCs into ECs. Furthermore, we aimed to enhance cell survival, vessel formation, and therapeutic potential by encapsulating hPSC-ECs with a peptide amphiphile (PA) nanomatrix gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We induced differentiation of hPSCs into the mesodermal lineage by culturing on collagen-coated plates with a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor. Next, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor were added for endothelial lineage differentiation, followed by sorting for CDH5 (VE-cadherin). We constructed an extracellular matrix–mimicking PA nanomatrix gel (PA-RGDS) by incorporating the cell adhesive ligand Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) and a matrix metalloproteinase-2–degradable sequence. We then evaluated whether the encapsulation of hPSC-CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells in PA-RGDS could enhance long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> cell survival and vascular regenerative effects in a hind-limb ischemia model with laser Doppler perfusion imaging, bioluminescence imaging, real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The resultant hPSC-derived CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells (hPSC-ECs) showed highly enriched and genuine EC characteristics and proangiogenic activities. When injected into ischemic hind limbs, hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery and higher vessel-forming capacity compared with media-, PA-RGDS–, or human umbilical vein EC–injected groups. However, the group receiving the PA-RGDS–encapsulated hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery, more robust and longer cell survival (> 10 months), and higher and prolonged angiogenic and vascular incorporation capabilities than the bare hPSC-EC–injected group. Surprisingly, the engrafted hPSC-ECs demonstrated previously unknown sustained and dynamic vessel-forming behavior: initial perivascular concentration, a guiding role for new vessel formation, and progressive incorporation into the vessels over 10 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We generated highly enriched hPSC-ECs via a clinically compatible system. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that a biocompatible PA-RGDS nanomatrix gel substantially improved long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival of hPSC-ECs in an ischemic environment and improved neovascularization effects of hPSC-ECs via prolonged and unique angiogenic and vessel-forming properties. This PA-RGDS–mediated transplantation of hPSC-ECs can serve as a novel platform for cell-based therapy and investigation of long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> behavior of hPSC-ECs.</p></sec>

Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Lowering for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Among Men With Primary Elevations of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels of 190 mg/dL or Above
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with primary elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥190 mg/dL are at a higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as a result of long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> exposure to markedly elevated LDL-C levels. Therefore, initiation of statin therapy is recommended for these individuals. However, there is a lack of randomized trial evidence supporting these recommendations in primary prevention. In the present analysis, we provide hitherto unpublished data on the cardiovascular effects of LDL-C lowering among a primary prevention population with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We aimed to assess the benefits of LDL-C lowering on cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with primary elevations of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL without preexisting vascular disease at baseline. We performed post hoc analyses from the WOSCOPS (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study) randomized, placebo-controlled trial, and observational posttrial long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> follow-up, after excluding individuals with evidence of vascular disease at baseline. WOSCOPS enrolled 6595 men aged 45 to 64 years, who were randomly assigned to pravastatin 40 mg/d or placebo. In the present analyses, 5529 participants without evidence of vascular disease were included, stratified by LDL-C levels into those with LDL-C <190 mg/dL (n=2969; mean LDL-C 178±6 mg/dL) and those with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (n=2560; mean LDL-C 206±12 mg/dL). The effect of pravastatin versus placebo on coronary heart disease and major adverse cardiovascular events were assessed over the 4.9-year randomized controlled trial phase and on mortality outcomes over a total of 20 years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 5529 individuals without vascular disease, pravastatin reduced the risk of coronary heart disease by 27% (<i>P</i>=0.002) and major adverse cardiovascular events by 25% (<i>P</i>=0.004) consistently among those with and without LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (<i>P</i>-interaction >0.9). Among individuals with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, pravastatin reduced the risk of coronary heart disease by 27% (<i>P</i>=0.033) and major adverse cardiovascular events by 25% (<i>P</i>=0.037) during the initial trial phase and the risk of coronary heart disease death, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality by 28% (<i>P</i>=0.020), 25% (<i>P</i>=0.009), and 18% (<i>P</i>=0.004), respectively, over a total of 20 years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The present analyses provide robust novel evidence for the short- and long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> benefits of lowering LDL-C for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease among individuals with primary elevations of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL.</p></sec>

Population-Based Long-Term Cardiac-Specific Mortality Among 34 489 Five-Year Survivors of Childhood Cancer in Great Britain
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Increased risks of cardiac morbidity and mortality among childhood cancer survivors have been described previously. However, little is known about the very long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> risks of cardiac mortality and whether the risk has decreased among those more recently diagnosed. We investigated the risk of long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> cardiac mortality among survivors within the recently extended British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a population-based cohort of 34 489 five-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed from 1940 to 2006 and followed up until February 28, 2014, and is the largest cohort to date to assess late cardiac mortality. Standardized mortality ratios and absolute excess risks were used to quantify cardiac mortality excess risk. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the simultaneous effect of risk factors. Likelihood ratio tests were used to test for heterogeneity and trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 181 cardiac deaths were observed, which was 3.4 times that expected. Survivors were 2.5 times and 5.9 times more at risk of ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy/heart failure death, respectively, than expected. Among those >60 years of age, subsequent primary neoplasms, cardiac disease, and other circulatory conditions accounted for 31%, 22%, and 15% of all excess deaths, respectively, providing clear focus for preventive interventions. The risk of both overall cardiac and cardiomyopathy/heart failure mortality was greatest among those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989. Specifically, for cardiomyopathy/heart failure deaths, survivors diagnosed from 1980 to 1989 had 28.9 times the excess number of deaths observed for survivors diagnosed either before 1970 or from 1990 on.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Excess cardiac mortality among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer remains increased beyond 50 years of age and has clear messages in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>s of prevention strategies. However, the fact that the risk was greatest in those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989 suggests that initiatives to reduce cardiotoxicity among those treated more recently may be having a measurable impact.</p></sec>

Long-Term Safety and Effectiveness of Mechanical Versus Biologic Aortic Valve Prostheses in Older Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>There is a paucity of long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> data comparing biological versus mechanical aortic valve prostheses in older individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed follow-up of patients aged 65 to 80 years undergoing aortic valve replacement with a biological (n=24 410) or mechanical (n=14 789) prosthesis from 1991 to 1999 at 605 centers within the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database using Medicare inpatient claims (mean, 12.6 years; maximum, 17 years; minimum, 8 years), and outcomes were compared by propensity methods. Among Medicare-linked patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (mean age, 73 years), both reoperation (4.0%) and endocarditis (1.9%) were uncommon to 12 years; however, the risk for other adverse outcomes was high, including death (66.5%), stroke (14.1%), and bleeding (17.9%). Compared with those receiving a mechanical valve, patients given a bioprosthesis had a similar adjusted risk for death (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.07), higher risks for reoperation (hazard ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 2.14–3.03) and endocarditis (hazard ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–1.94), and lower risks for stroke (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.93) and bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.70). Although these results were generally consistent among patient subgroups, bioprosthesis patients aged 65 to 69 years had a substantially elevated 12-year absolute risk of reoperation (10.5%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Among patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> mortality rates were similar for those who received bioprosthetic versus mechanical valves. Bioprostheses were associated with a higher long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> risk of reoperation and endocarditis but a lower risk of stroke and hemorrhage. These risks varied as a function of a patient’s age and comorbidities.</p></sec>

Arthroscopic decompression not recommended in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Rotator cuff tendinopathy has a multifactorial origin. Rejecting   the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning operative treatment   at initial presentation in the first line. Physiotherapy exercise   programmes are the accepted first line treatment. The aim of this   study was to assess the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> additional benefits of subacromial decompression   in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This randomised controlled trial of 140 patients (52 men, 88   women, mean age 47.1 years; 18 to 60) with rotator cuff tendinopathy   extended previous work up to a maximum of 13 years. The patients   were randomised into two treatment groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty   and a supervised exercise treatment and a similar supervised exercise   treatment alone. Self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS)   was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures were disability,   working ability, pain at night, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire   score and the number of painful days during the three months preceding   the final assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 90 patients (64%) returned questionnaires at a mean   12 years after randomisation. On an intention-to-treat basis, both   treatment groups reached statistically significant improvement compared   with the initial VAS for pain, but there was no significant difference   between groups. The same was true in the secondary outcome measures.   Due to group changes, the results were also analysed per protocol:   operated or not. No significant differences between the groups were   found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The natural history of rotator cuff tendinopathy probably plays   a significant role in the results in the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>. Even though   the patients who underwent operative treatment had a stronger belief   in recovery, which is likely to be surgical and the effect of placebo,   the exercise group obtained similar results. In the future, an optimum   exercise regime should be searched for, as the most clinically and   cost-effective conservative treatment for rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:799–805.</p></sec>

The Birmingham Interlocking Pelvic Osteotomy for acetabular dysplasia
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> clinical   and radiographic outcomes of the Birmingham Interlocking Pelvic   Osteotomy (BIPO).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this prospective study, we report the mid- to long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> clinical   outcomes of the first 100 consecutive patients (116 hips; 88 in   women, 28 in men) undergoing BIPO, reflecting the surgeon’s learning   curve. Failure was defined as conversion to hip arthroplasty. The   mean age at operation was 31 years (7 to 57). Three patients (three   hips) were lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Survivorship was 76% at ten years and 57% at a mean of 17 years.   Younger patients (< 20 years) had the best survivorship (20 hips   at risk; 90% at 17 years; 95% confidence interval 65 to 97). Post-operative   complications occurred after 12 operations (10.4%) over the duration   of the study. Increasing patient age and hip arthritis grade were   primary de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>inants of surgical failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>BIPO provides good to excellent survivorship in appropriately   selected patients, with a relatively low rate of complications.

Long-term outcomes of cemented <i>versus</i> cementless humeral components in arthroplasty of the shoulder
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In the initial development of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA),   the humeral component was usually fixed with cement. Cementless   components were subsequently introduced. The aim of this study was   to compare the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> outcome of cemented and cementless humeral   components in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 cemented humeral components and   3469 cementless components. Patients with the two types of fixation   were matched for nine different covariates using a propensity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with cemented   and cementless components were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral component de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>ined at revision surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-operative infection and operating time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of survival were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively. Survival without loosening   at 20 years was 98% for cemented components and 92.4% for cementless   components. After propensity score matching including fixation as   de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>ined by the design of the component, humeral loosening was   also found to be significantly higher in the cementless group. Survival   without humeral loosening at 20 years was 98.7% for cemented components   and 91.0% for cementless components. There was no significant difference   in the risk of intra- or post-operative fracture. The rate of survival   without deep infection and the mean operating time were significantly   higher in the cemented group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both types of fixation give rates of long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival of >   90%.

Debridement and implant retention in the management of hip periprosthetic joint infection
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To analyse the effectiveness of debridement and implant retention   (DAIR) in patients with hip periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   and the relationship to patient characteristics. The outcome was   evaluated in hips with confirmed PJI and a follow-up of not less   than two years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients in whom DAIR was performed were identified from our   hip arthroplasty register (between 2004 and 2013). Adherence to   criteria for DAIR was assessed according to a previously published   algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>DAIR was performed as part of a curative procedure in 46 hips   in 42 patients. The mean age was 73.2 years (44.6 to 87.7), including   20 women and 22 men. In 34 hips in 32 patients (73.9%), PJI was   confirmed. In 12 hips, the criteria for PJI were not fulfilled and   antibiotics stopped. In 41 (89.1%) of all hips and in 32 (94.1%)   of the confirmed PJIs, all criteria for DAIR were fulfilled. In   patients with exogenous PJI, DAIR was performed not more than three   days after referral. In haematogenous infections, the duration of   symptoms did not exceed 21 days. In 28 hips, a single debridement   and in six hips two surgical debridements were required. In 28 (87.5%)   of 32 patients, the total treatment duration was three months.

Validation of the English language Forgotten Joint Score-12 as an outcome measure for total hip and knee arthroplasty in a British population
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To validate the English language Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12)   as a tool to evaluate the outcome of hip and knee arthroplasty in   a United Kingdom population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients undergoing surgery between January and August 2014   were eligible for inclusion. Prospective data were collected from   205 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) and 231 patients   undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Revision total knee arthroplasty for failed high tibial osteotomy and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have similar patient-reported outcome measures in a two-year follow-up study
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about the relative outcomes of revision of unicompartmental   knee arthroplasty (UKA) and high tibial osteotomy (HTO) to total   knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study is to compare the   outcomes of revision surgery for the two procedures in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>s of   complications, re-revision and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)   at a minimum of two years follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This study was a retrospective review of data from an institutional   arthroplasty registry for cases performed between 2001 and 2014.   A total of 292 patients were identified, of which 217 had a revision   of HTO to TKA, and 75 had revision of UKA to TKA. While mean follow-up   was longer for the HTO group compared with the UKA group, patient   demographics (age, body mass index and Charlson co-morbidity index)   and PROMs (Short Form-36, Oxford Knee Score, Knee Society Score,   both objective and functional) were similar in the two groups prior   to revision surgery. Outcomes included the rate of complications   and    re-operation, PROMS and patient-reported satisfaction at six months   and two years post-operatively.

The rate of wear of second-generation highly crosslinked polyethylene liners five years post-operatively does not increase if large femoral heads are used
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The increased <i>in vivo</i> resistance to wear of   highly crosslinked polyethylene (HXLPE) in total hip arthroplasty   (THA) has led to an increased use of larger articulations which   have been shown to reduce the incidence of early dislocation. To   date, there are few reports of the wear of larger articulations   using second generation HXLPE liners. Our prospective cohort study   measured the bedding-in and early wear of large (36 mm and 40 mm   diameter) articulations involving a second generation X3 HXLPE liner   and compared our findings with previous clinical and <i>in vitro</i> studies   of the same material.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The proximal penetration of the femoral head five years post-operatively   was measured for 15 patients using radiostereometric analysis (RSA).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median proximal bedding-in within the first post-operative   year was 0.022 mm (interquartile range (IQR) -0.050 to 0.091).

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to compare the mid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> outcomes   of patients with late-stage arthritis of the wrist treated with   proximal row carpectomy (PRC) and dorsal capsular interposition   (DCI) arthroplasty with a matched cohort treated with routine PRC   alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 25 arthritic wrists (24 patients) with pre-existing   degenerative changes of the proximal capitate and/or the lunate   fossa of the radius were treated with PRC + DCI over a ten-year   period. This group of patients were matched 1:2 with a group of   50 wrists (48 patients) without degenerative changes in the capitate   or lunate fossa that were treated with a routine PRC alone during   the same period. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery   was 56.8 years (25 to 81), and the demographics and baseline range   of movement of the wrist, grip strength, Quick Disabilities of the   Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) score, and Patient-Rated Wrist   Evaluation (PRWE) score were similar in both groups. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 5.9 years (1.8 to 11.8), significant improvements   in mean grip strength, the flexion-extension arc of movement of   the wrist, QuickDASH, and PRWE scores were seen in both groups.   There was no diifference between the groups for any of the outcomes.   One patient in the PRC + DCI group required additional surgery for   a deep infection, while two in the PRC group had complications (one   wound dehiscence requiring revision closure, one transient radial   sensory neuritis). One patient in each group required total arthrodesis   of the wrist for progressive degenerative radiocarpal changes. A   total of 70 patients (93%) were satisfied with the outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PRC with DCI is an effective form of treatment for late-stage   arthritis of the wrist involving the capitolunate joint, with mid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>   outcomes that are similar to those in patients without degenerative   changes affecting the capitate or lunate fossa who are treated with   a routine PRC alone.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:197–204.</p></sec>

Sex Difference in Patients With Ischemic Heart Failure Undergoing Surgical Revascularization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Female sex is conventionally considered a risk factor for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has been included as a poor prognostic factor in multiple cardiac operative risk evaluation scores. We aimed to investigate the association of sex and the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> benefit of CABG in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction enrolled in the prospective STICH trial (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure Study).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The STICH trial randomized 1212 patients (148 [12%] women and 1064 [88%] men) with coronary artery disease and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% to CABG+medical therapy (MED) versus MED alone. Long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> (10-year) outcomes with each treatment were compared according to sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At baseline, women were older (63.4 versus 59.3 years; <i>P</i>=0.016) with higher body mass index (27.9 versus 26.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i>=0.001). Women had more coronary artery disease risk factors (diabetes mellitus, 55.4% versus 37.2%; hypertension, 70.9% versus 58.6%; hyperlipidemia, 70.3% versus 58.9%) except for smoking (13.5% versus 21.8%) and had lower rates of prior CABG (0% versus 3.4%; all <i>P</i><0.05) than men. Moreover, women had higher New York Heart Association class (class III/IV, 66.2% versus 57.0%), lower 6-minute walk capacity (300 versus 350 m), and lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary scores (51 versus 63; all <i>P</i><0.05). Over 10 years of follow-up, all-cause mortality (49.0% versus 65.8%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–0.86; <i>P</i>=0.002) and cardiovascular mortality (34.3% versus 52.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.006) were significantly lower in women compared with men. With randomization to CABG+MED versus MED treatment, there was no significant interaction between sex and treatment group in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or the composite of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization (all <i>P</i>>0.05). In addition, surgical deaths were not statistically different (1.5% versus 5.1%; <i>P</i>=0.187) between sexes among patients randomized to CABG per protocol as initial treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Sex is not associated with the effect of CABG+MED versus MED on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, the composite of death or cardiovascular hospitalization, or surgical deaths in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. Thus, sex should not influence treatment decisions about CABG in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Association Between Prompt Defibrillation and Epinephrine Treatment With Long-Term Survival After In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prior studies have reported higher in-hospital survival with prompt defibrillation and epinephrine treatment in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Whether this survival benefit persists after discharge is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We linked data from a national IHCA registry with Medicare files and identified 36 961 patients ≥65 years of age with an IHCA at 517 hospitals between 2000 and 2011. Patients with IHCA caused by pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were stratified by prompt (≤2 minutes) versus delayed (>2 minutes) defibrillation, whereas patients with IHCA caused by asystole or pulseless electric activity were stratified by prompt (≤5 minutes) versus delayed (>5 minutes) epinephrine treatment. The association between prompt treatment and long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival for each rhythm type was assessed with multivariable hierarchical modified Poisson regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 8119 patients with an IHCA caused by ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, the rate of 1-year survival was higher in those treated with prompt defibrillation than with delayed defibrillation (25.7% [1466 of 5714] versus 15.5% [373 of 2405]; adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32–1.69; <i>P</i><0.0001). This survival advantage persisted at 3 years (19.1% versus 11.0%; adjusted RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.23–1.69; <i>P</i><0.0001) and at 5 years (14.7% versus 7.9%; adjusted RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.22–1.83; <i>P</i><0.0001). Of 28 842 patients with an IHCA caused by asystole/pulseless electric activity, the rate of 1-year survival with prompt epinephrine treatment was higher than with delayed treatment (5.4% [1341 of 24 885] versus 4.3% [168 of 3957]; adjusted RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02–1.41; <i>P</i>=0.02), but this survival benefit was no longer present at 3 years (3.5% versus 2.9%; adjusted RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.95–1.45; <i>P</i>=0.15) and at 5 years (2.3% versus 1.9%; adjusted RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.88–1.58; <i>P</i>=0.27).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Prompt defibrillation for IHCA caused by ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was associated with higher rates of long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival throughout 5 years of follow-up, whereas prompt epinephrine treatment for asystole/pulseless electric activity was associated with greater survival at 1 year but not at 3 or 5 years. By quantifying the greater survival associated with timely defibrillation and epinephrine administration, these findings provide important insights into the durability of survival benefits for 2 process-of-care measures in current resuscitation guidelines.</p></sec>

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart disease mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals between PM<sub>2.5</sub> (per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) and heart disease mortality using the full sample and the sample adults, which have information on additional health variables. Interaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>s were used to examine differences in the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mortality association by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 65 936 of the full sample died during follow-up, and 22 152 died from heart disease. After adjustment for several factors, we found a significant positive association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease mortality (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.25). This association was similar in sample adults with adjustment for smoking and body mass index (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.31). Interaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>s for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic groups compared with the non-Hispanic white group were not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Using a nationally representative sample, the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease mortality was elevated and similar to previous estimates. Associations for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults were not statistically significantly different from those for non-Hispanic white adults.</p></sec>

Long-Term Potassium Monitoring and Dynamics in Heart Failure and Risk of Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The prognostic value of long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> potassium monitoring and dynamics in heart failure has not been characterized completely. We sought to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>ine the association between serum potassium values collected at follow-up with all-cause mortality in a prospective and consecutive cohort of patients discharged from a previous acute heart failure admission.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Serum potassium was measured at every physician-patient encounter, including hospital admissions and ambulatory settings. The multivariable-adjusted association of serum potassium with mortality was assessed by using comprehensive state-of-the-art regression methods that can accommodate time-dependent exposure modeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study sample included 2164 patients with a total of 16 116 potassium observations. Mean potassium at discharge was 4.3±0.48 mEq/L. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L), normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (>5 mEq/L) were observed at the index admission in 77 (3.6%), 1965 (90.8%), and 122 (5.6%) patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 2.8 years (range, 0.03–12.8 years), 1090 patients died (50.4%). On a continuous scale, the multivariable-adjusted association of potassium values and mortality revealed a nonlinear association (U-shaped) with higher risk at both ends of its distribution (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.001). Likewise, the adjusted hazard ratios for hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, normokalemia as reference, were 2.35 (95% confidence interval, 1.40–3.93; <i>P</i>=0.001) and 1.55 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.16; <i>P</i>=0.011), respectively (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.0003). Furthermore, dynamic changes in potassium were independently associated with substantial differences in mortality risk. Potassium normalization was independently associated with lower mortality risk (<i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Either modeled continuously or categorically, serum potassium levels during long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> monitoring were independently associated with mortality in patients with heart failure. Likewise, persistence of abnormal potassium levels was linked to a higher risk of death in comparison with patients who maintained or returned to normal values.</p></sec>

Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction and Myocardial Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are common in clinical practice, but long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> consequences are uncertain. We aimed to define long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> outcomes and explore risk stratification in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified consecutive patients (n=2122) with elevated cardiac troponin I concentrations (≥0.05 µg/L) at a tertiary cardiac center. All diagnoses were adjudicated as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) and noncardiovascular death. To explore competing risks, cause-specific hazard ratios were obtained using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The adjudicated index diagnosis was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively. At 5 years, all-cause death rates were higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (62.5%) or myocardial injury (72.4%) compared with type 1 myocardial infarction (36.7%). The majority of excess deaths in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were because of noncardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.92–2.81 versus type 1 myocardial infarction). Despite this finding, the observed crude major adverse cardiovascular event rates were similar between groups (30.6% versus 32.6%), with differences apparent after adjustment for covariates (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.96). Coronary heart disease was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.24).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite an excess in noncardiovascular death, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury have a similar crude rate of major adverse cardiovascular events as those with type 1 myocardial infarction. Identifying underlying coronary heart disease in this vulnerable population may help target therapies that could modify future risk.</p></sec>

Persistent Long-Term Structural, Functional, and Metabolic Changes After Stress-Induced (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized acute heart failure syndrome precipitated by intense emotional stress. Although there is an apparent rapid and spontaneous recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction, the long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> clinical and functional consequences of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are ill-defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In an observational case-control study, we recruited 37 patients with prior (>12-month) takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and 37 age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched control subjects. Patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. All participants underwent detailed clinical phenotypic characterization, including serum biomarker analysis, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance including cardiac <sup>31</sup>P-spectroscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Participants were predominantly middle-age (64±11 years) women (97%). Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurred 20 (range 13–39) months before the study, the majority (88%) of patients had persisting symptoms compatible with heart failure (median of 13 [range 0–76] in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) and cardiac limitation on exercise testing (reduced peak oxygen consumption, 24±1.3 versus 31±1.3 mL/kg/min, <i>P</i><0.001; increased VE/V<sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> slope, 31±1 versus 26±1, <i>P</i>=0.002). Despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction and serum biomarkers, patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy had impaired cardiac deformation indices (reduced apical circumferential strain, −16±1.0 versus −23±1.5%, <i>P</i><0.001; global longitudinal strain, −17±1 versus −20±1%, <i>P</i>=0.006), increased native T1 mapping values (1264±10 versus 1184±10 ms, <i>P</i><0.001), and impaired cardiac energetic status (phosphocreatine/γ-adenosine triphosphate ratio, 1.3±0.1 versus 1.9±0.1, <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In contrast to previous perceptions, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has long-lasting clinical consequences, including demonstrable symptomatic and functional impairment associated with persistent subclinical cardiac dysfunction.

Genetic Predisposition, Clinical Risk Factor Burden, and Lifetime Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> probability of developing atrial fibrillation (AF) considering genetic predisposition and clinical risk factor burden is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We estimated the lifetime risk of AF in individuals from the community-based Framingham Heart Study. Polygenic risk for AF was derived using a score of ≈1000 AF-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Clinical risk factor burden was calculated for each individual using a validated risk score for incident AF comprised of height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, current smoking status, antihypertensive medication use, diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction, and history of heart failure. We estimated the lifetime risk of AF within tertiles of polygenic and clinical risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 4606 participants without AF at 55 years of age, 580 developed incident AF (median follow-up, 9.4 years; 25th–75th percentile, 4.4–14.3 years). The lifetime risk of AF >55 years of age was 37.1% and was substantially influenced by both polygenic and clinical risk factor burden. Among individuals free of AF at 55 years of age, those in low-polygenic and clinical risk tertiles had a lifetime risk of AF of 22.3% (95% confidence interval, 15.4−9.1), whereas those in high-risk tertiles had a risk of 48.2% (95% confidence interval, 41.3−55.1). A lower clinical risk factor burden was associated with later AF onset after adjusting for genetic predisposition (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In our community-based cohort, the lifetime risk of AF was 37%. Estimation of polygenic AF risk is feasible and together with clinical risk factor burden explains a substantial gradient in long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> AF risk.</p></sec>

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the risk of long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> side effects limit the success of existing therapeutic agents. Although Tspan12 has been shown to regulate retinal vascular development, nothing is known about its involvement in neovascular disease and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rodent models of retinal neovascular disease, including the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy and the very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model were analyzed for Tspan/β-catenin regulation. Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12. Therapeutic effects of the newly developed Ab on vascular endothelial cells were tested in vitro and in vivo in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The newly developed anti-Tspan12 Ab exhibited potent inhibitory effects on endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the Ab inhibited the interaction between Tspan12 and Frizzled-4 and effectively modulates β-catenin levels and target genes in vascular endothelial cells. Tspan12/β-catenin signaling was activated in response to acute and chronic stress in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor mouse model of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal application of the Ab showed significant therapeutic effects in both models without inducing negative side effects on retina function. Moreover, combined intravitreal injection of the Ab with a known vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, Aflibercept, resulted in significant enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of each monotherapy. Combination therapy with the Tspan12 blocking antibody can be used to reduce anti-vascular endothelial growth factor doses, thus decreasing the risk of long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> off-target effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tspan12/β-catenin signaling is critical for the progression of vasoproliferative disease. The newly developed anti-Tspan12 antibody has therapeutic effects in vasoproliferative retinopathy and can enhance the potency of existing anti- vascular endothelial growth factor agents.</p></sec>

cGMP-Elevating Compounds and Ischemic Conditioning Provide Cardioprotection Against Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury via Cardiomyocyte-Specific BK Channels
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The nitric oxide–sensitive guanylyl cyclase/cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I signaling pathway can afford protection against the ischemia/reperfusion injury that occurs during myocardial infarction. Reportedly, voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels of the BK type are stimulated by cGMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I, and recent ex vivo studies implicated that increased BK activity favors the survival of the myocardium at ischemia/reperfusion. It remains unclear, however, whether the molecular events downstream of cGMP involve BK channels present in cardiomyocytes or in other cardiac cell types.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gene-targeted mice with a cardiomyocyte- or smooth muscle cell–specific deletion of the BK (CMBK or SMBK knockouts) were subjected to the open-chest model of myocardial infarction. Infarct sizes of the conditional mutants were compared with litter-matched controls, global BK knockout, and wild-type mice. Cardiac damage was assessed after mechanical conditioning or pharmacological stimulation of the cGMP pathway and by using direct modulators of BK. Long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> outcome was studied with respect to heart functions and cardiac fibrosis in a chronic myocardial infarction model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Global BK knockouts and CMBK knockouts, in contrast with SMBK knockouts, exhibited significantly larger infarct sizes compared with their respective controls. Ablation of CMBK resulted in higher serum levels of cardiac troponin I and elevated amounts of reactive oxygen species, lower phosphorylated extracellular receptor kinase and phosphorylated AKT levels and an increase in myocardial apoptosis. Moreover, CMBK was required to allow beneficial effects of both nitric oxide–sensitive guanylyl cyclase activation and inhibition of the cGMP-degrading phosphodiesterase-5, ischemic preconditioning, and postconditioning regimens. To this end, after 4 weeks of reperfusion, fibrotic tissue increased and myocardial strain echocardiography was significantly compromised in CMBK-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lack of CMBK channels renders the heart more susceptible to ischemia/reperfusion injury, whereas the pathological events elicited by ischemia/reperfusion do not involve BK in vascular smooth muscle cells. BK seems to permit the protective effects triggered by cinaciguat, riociguat, and different phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and beneficial actions of ischemic preconditioning and ischemic postconditioning by a mechanism stemming primarily from cardiomyocytes. This study establishes mitochondrial CMBK channels as a promising target for limiting acute cardiac damage and adverse long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> events that occur after myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

The Optimal Timing of Stage 2 Palliation for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In infants requiring 3-stage single-ventricle palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, attrition after the Norwood procedure remains significant. The effect of the timing of stage 2 palliation (S2P), a physician-modifiable factor, on long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival is not well understood. We hypothesized that an optimal interval between the Norwood and S2P that both minimizes pre-S2P attrition and maximizes post-S2P survival exists and is associated with individual patient characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial public data set was used. Transplant-free survival (TFS) was modeled from (1) Norwood to S2P and (2) S2P to 3 years by using parametric hazard analysis. Factors associated with death or heart transplantation were de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>ined for each interval. To account for staged procedures, risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood TFS (the probability of TFS at 3 years given survival to S2P) was calculated using parametric conditional survival analysis. TFS from the Norwood to S2P was first predicted. TFS after S2P to 3 years was then predicted and adjusted for attrition before S2P by multiplying by the estimate of TFS to S2P. The optimal timing of S2P was de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>ined by generating nomograms of risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood, TFS versus the interval from the Norwood to S2P.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 547 included patients, 399 survived to S2P (73%). Of the survivors to S2P, 349 (87%) survived to 3-year follow-up. The median interval from the Norwood to S2P was 5.1 (interquartile range, 4.1–6.0) months. The risk-adjusted, 3-year, TFS was 68±7%. A Norwood-S2P interval of 3 to 6 months was associated with greatest 3-year TFS overall and in patients with few risk factors. In patients with multiple risk factors, TFS was severely compromised, regardless of the timing of S2P and most severely when S2P was performed early. No difference in the optimal timing of S2P existed when stratified by shunt type.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In infants with few risk factors, progressing to S2P at 3 to 6 months after the Norwood procedure was associated with maximal TFS. Early S2P did not rescue patients with greater risk factor burdens. Instead, referral for heart transplantation may offer their best chance at long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although previous studies have demonstrated that patients receiving bilateral internal mammary artery (BIMA) conduits during coronary artery bypass grafting have better long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival than those receiving a single internal mammary artery (SIMA), data on risk of repeat revascularization are more limited. In this analysis, we compare the timing, frequency, and type of repeat coronary revascularization among patients receiving BIMA and SIMA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of 47 984 consecutive coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries performed from 1992 to 2014 among 7 medical centers reporting to a prospectively maintained clinical registry. Among the study population, 1482 coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries with BIMA were identified, and 1297 patients receiving BIMA were propensity-matched to 1297 patients receiving SIMA. The primary end point was freedom from repeat coronary revascularization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median duration of follow-up was 13.2 (IQR, 7.4–17.7) years. Patients were well matched by age, body mass index, major comorbidities, and cardiac function. There was a higher freedom from repeat revascularization among patients receiving BIMA than among patients receiving SIMA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.65–0.94]; <i>P</i>=0.009). Among the matched cohort, 19.4% (n=252) of patients receiving SIMA underwent repeat revascularization, whereas this frequency was 15.1% (n=196) among patients receiving BIMA (<i>P</i>=0.004). The majority of repeat revascularization procedures were percutaneous coronary interventions (94.2%), and this did not differ between groups (<i>P</i>=0.274). Groups also did not differ in the ratio of native versus graft vessel percutaneous coronary intervention (<i>P</i>=0.899), or regarding percutaneous coronary intervention target vessels; the most common targets in both groups were the right coronary (<i>P</i>=0.133) and circumflex arteries (<i>P</i>=0.093). In comparison with SIMA, BIMA grafting was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality at 12 years of follow-up (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69–0.91]; <i>P</i>=0.001), and there was no difference in in-hospital morbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>BIMA grafting was associated with a reduced risk of repeat revascularization and an improvement in long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival and should be considered more frequently during coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec>

Outcomes Associated With Extraction Versus Capping and Abandoning Pacing and Defibrillator Leads
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Lead management is an increasingly important aspect of care in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices; however, relatively little is known about long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> outcomes after capping and abandoning leads.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using the 5% Medicare sample, we identified patients with de novo cardiac implantable electronic device implantations between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013, and with a subsequent lead addition or extraction ≥12 months after the de novo implantation. Patients who underwent extraction for infection were excluded. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, we compared cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality, device-related infection, device revision, and lead extraction at 1 and 5 years for the extraction versus the cap and abandon group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 6859 patients, 1113 (16.2%) underwent extraction, whereas 5746 (83.8%) underwent capping and abandonment. Extraction patients tended to be younger (median, 78 versus 79 years; <i>P</i><0.0001), were less likely to be male (65% versus 68%; <i>P</i>=0.05), and had shorter lead dwell time (median, 3.0 versus 4.0 years; <i>P</i><0.0001) and fewer comorbidities. Over a median follow-up of 2.4 years (25th, 75th percentiles, 1.0, 4.3 years), the overall 1-year and 5-year cumulative incidence of mortality was 13.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.7–14.4) and 54.3% (95% CI, 52.8–55.8), respectively. Extraction was associated with a lower risk of device infection at 5 years relative to capping (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62–0.97; <i>P</i>=0.027). There was no association between extraction and mortality, lead revision, or lead extraction at 5 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Elective lead extraction for noninfectious indications had similar long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival to that for capping and abandoning leads in a Medicare population. However, extraction was associated with lower risk of device infections at 5 years.</p></sec>

Low-Dose Aspirin Discontinuation and Risk of Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>There are increasing concerns about risks associated with aspirin discontinuation in the absence of major surgery or bleeding. We investigated whether long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> low-dose aspirin discontinuation and treatment gaps increase the risk of cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a cohort study of 601 527 users of low-dose aspirin for primary or secondary prevention in the Swedish prescription register between 2005 and 2009 who were >40 years of age, were free from previous cancer, and had ≥80% adherence during the first observed year of treatment. Cardiovascular events were identified with the Swedish inpatient and cause-of-death registers. The first 3 months after a major bleeding or surgical procedure were excluded from the time at risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During a median of 3.0 years of follow-up, 62 690 cardiovascular events occurred. Patients who discontinued aspirin had a higher rate of cardiovascular events than those who continued (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–1.41), corresponding to an additional cardiovascular event observed per year in 1 of every 74 patients who discontinue aspirin. The risk increased shortly after discontinuation and did not appear to diminish over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> users, discontinuation of low-dose aspirin in the absence of major surgery or bleeding was associated with a >30% increased risk of cardiovascular events. Adherence to low-dose aspirin treatment in the absence of major surgery or bleeding is likely an important treatment goal.</p></sec>

Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase-C Suppresses cAMP Formation in Human Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Chronic heart failure (HF) is associated with altered signal transduction via β-adrenoceptors and G proteins and with reduced cAMP formation. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are enriched at the plasma membrane of patients with end-stage HF, but the functional consequences of this are largely unknown, particularly for NDPK-C. Here, we investigated the potential role of NDPK-C in cardiac cAMP formation and contractility.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Real-time polymerase chain reaction, (far) Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry were used to study the expression, interaction with G proteins, and localization of NDPKs. cAMP levels were de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>ined with immunoassays or fluorescent resonance energy transfer, and contractility was de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>ined in cardiomyocytes (cell shortening) and in vivo (fractional shortening).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>NDPK-C was essential for the formation of an NDPK-B/G protein complex. Protein and mRNA levels of NDPK-C were upregulated in end-stage human HF, in rats after long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> isoprenaline stimulation through osmotic minipumps, and after incubation of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes with isoprenaline. Isoprenaline also promoted translocation of NDPK-C to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of NDPK-C in cardiomyocytes increased cAMP levels and sensitized cardiomyocytes to isoprenaline-induced augmentation of contractility, whereas NDPK-C knockdown decreased cAMP levels. In vivo, depletion of NDPK-C in zebrafish embryos caused cardiac edema and ventricular dysfunction. NDPK-B knockout mice had unaltered NDPK-C expression but showed contractile dysfunction and exacerbated cardiac remodeling during long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> isoprenaline stimulation. In human end-stage HF, the complex formation between NDPK-C and Gα<sub>i2</sub> was increased whereas the NDPK-C/Gα<sub>s</sub> interaction was decreased, producing a switch that may contribute to an NDPK-C–dependent cAMP reduction in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings identify NDPK-C as an essential requirement for both the interaction between NDPK isoforms and between NDPK isoforms and G proteins. NDPK-C is a novel critical regulator of β-adrenoceptor/cAMP signaling and cardiac contractility. By switching from Gα<sub>s</sub> to Gα<sub>i2</sub> activation, NDPK-C may contribute to lower cAMP levels and the related contractile dysfunction in HF.</p></sec>

Twenty-Year Outcome After Mitral Repair Versus Replacement for Severe Degenerative Mitral Regurgitation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mitral valve (MV) repair is preferred over replacement in clinical guidelines and is an important de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong>inant of the indication for surgery in degenerative mitral regurgitation. However, the level of evidence supporting current recommendations is low, and recent data cast doubts on its validity in the current era. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to analyze very long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> outcome after MV repair and replacement for degenerative mitral regurgitation with a flail leaflet.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MIDA (Mitral Regurgitation International Database) is a multicenter registry enrolling patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation with a flail leaflet in 6 tertiary European and US centers. We analyzed the outcome after MV repair (n=1709) and replacement (n=213) overall, by propensity score matching, and by inverse probability-of-treatment weighting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At baseline, patients undergoing MV repair were younger, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to present with a posterior leaflet prolapse than those undergoing MV replacement. After propensity score matching and inverse probability-of-treatment weighting, the 2 treatments groups were balanced, and absolute standardized differences were usually <10%, indicating adequate match. Operative mortality (defined as a death occurring within 30 days from surgery or during the same hospitalization) was lower after MV repair than after replacement in both the entire population (1.3% versus 4.7%; <i>P</i><0.001) and the propensity-matched population (0.2% versus 4.4%; <i>P</i><0.001). During a mean follow-up of 9.2 years, 552 deaths were observed, of which 207 were of cardiovascular origin. Twenty-year survival was better after MV repair than after MV replacement in both the entire population (46% versus 23%; <i>P</i><0.001) and the matched population (41% versus 24%; <i>P</i><0.001). Similar superiority of MV repair was obtained in patient subsets on the basis of age, sex, or any stratification criteria (all <i>P</i><0.001). MV repair was also associated with reduced incidence of reoperations and valve-related complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation with a flail leaflet referred to mitral surgery, MV repair was associated with lower operative mortality, better long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">term</span></strong> survival, and fewer valve-related complications compared with MV replacement.</p></sec>

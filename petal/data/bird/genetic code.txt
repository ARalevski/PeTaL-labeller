Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>De<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration of the nonrecombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is a common feature of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from the nonrecombining region of the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e. Fourteen gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pairs present on the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e and Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on the Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e does not recombine with the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s supports a role for GC-biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and close to two for Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution in this lineage.</p>

Global Analysis of Gene Expression in Response to Whole-Chromosome Aneuploidy in Hexaploid Wheat
<p>Aneuploidy, a condition of unbalanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e content, represents a large-effect mutation that bears significant relevance to human health and microbe adaptation. As such, extensive studies of aneuploidy have been conducted in unicellular model organisms and cancer cells. Aneuploidy also frequently is associated with plant polyploidization, but its impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression and its relevance to polyploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution/functional innovation remain largely unknown. Here, we used a panel of diverse types of whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e aneuploidy of hexaploid wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), all under the common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic background of cv Chinese Spring, to systemically investigate the impact of aneuploidy on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-, sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression. Compared with prior findings in haploid or diploid aneuploid systems, we unravel additional and novel features of alteration in global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression resulting from the two major impacts of aneuploidy, cis- and trans-regulation, as well as dosage compensation. We show that the expression-altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s map evenly along each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e, with no evidence for coregulating aggregated expression domains. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es in hexaploid wheat are unequal in their responses to aneuploidy with respect to the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s being dysregulated. Strikingly, homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es do not differ from nonhomologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es in terms of aneuploidy-induced trans-acting effects, suggesting that the three constituent sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es of hexaploid wheat are largely uncoupled at the transcriptional level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulation. Together, our findings shed new insights into the functional interplay between homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and interactions between sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es in hexaploid wheat, which bear implications to further our understanding of allopolyploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution and efforts in breeding new allopolyploid crops.</p>

Integrated Consensus Map of Cultivated Peanut and Wild Relatives Reveals Structures of the A and B Genomes of <i>Arachis</i> and Divergence of the Legume Genomes
<p>The complex, tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e structure of peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) has obstructed advances in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics in the species. The aim of this study is to understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e structure of <i>Arachis</i> by developing a high-density integrated consensus map. Three recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses between the A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e diploid species, <i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis stenosperma</i>; the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e diploid species, <i>Arachis ipaënsis</i> and <i>Arachis magna</i>; and between the AB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e tetraploids, <i>A. hypogaea</i> and an artificial amphidiploid (<i>A. ipaënsis</i> × <i>A. duranensis</i>)<sup>4×</sup>, were used to construct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic linkage maps: 10 linkage groups (LGs) of 544 cM with 597 loci for the A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e; 10 LGs of 461 cM with 798 loci for the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e; and 20 LGs of 1442 cM with 1469 loci for the AB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. The resultant maps plus 13 published maps were integrated into a consensus map covering 2651 cM with 3693 marker loci which was anchored to 20 consensus LGs corresponding to the A and B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences of <i>Cajanus cajan</i>, <i>Glycine max</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and <i>Medicago truncatula</i> revealed that the <i>Arachis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has segmented synteny relationship to the other legumes. The comparative maps in legumes, integrated tetraploid consensus maps, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-specific diploid maps will increase the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic understanding of <i>Arachis</i> and should facilitate molecular breeding.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression in eukaryotes, but their roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es at the single cell level and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for analyzing individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Here, we comparatively analyzed immunostained metaphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and ChIP-seq of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which revealed a chromatin basis for biased homoeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the two sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. However, intensities per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with biased modifications correlated with the greater number of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e pairs. Two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es displayed different expression levels compared with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local chromatin structure and expression levels for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved. This example of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many phenotypes, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic neighborhoods containing several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical distribution of individual members of families of duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Differences between previously annotated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, the inclusion or absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the CTDGs and their corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, and the splitting of certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.</p>

Healthy Roots and Leaves: Comparative Genome Structure of Horseradish and Watercress
<p>Horseradish (<i>Armoracia rusticana</i>) and watercress (<i>Nasturtium officinale</i>) are economically important cruciferous vegetable species with limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources. We used comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e painting to identify the extent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al collinearity between horseradish and watercress, and to reconstruct the origin and evolution of the two tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es (2<i>n</i> = 4<i>x</i> = 32). Our results show that horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es originated from a common ancestral (<i>n</i> = 8) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, structurally resembling the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype (<i>n</i> = 8), which, however, contained two unique translocation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es (AK6/8 and AK8/6). Except for a 2.4-Mb unequal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e translocation in watercress, both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es are structurally identical. The structural similarity of the two parental sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es might suggest an autotetraploid origin of horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e stasis, apart from the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e translocation, indicates that homeologous recombination played a limited role in postpolyploid evolution in both tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The octoploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of one-rowed watercress (<i>N. microphyllum</i>, 2<i>n</i> = 8<i>x</i> = 64), structurally mirroring the tetraploid horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, originated via autopolyploidization from the immediate tetraploid predecessor of watercress or hybridization between this and another now-extinct tetraploid <i>Nasturtium</i> species. These comparative cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic maps in horseradish and watercress represent a first stepping stone for future whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing efforts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic improvement of both crop species.</p>

Multi-Omics Driven Assembly and Annotation of the Sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) Genome
<p>Indian sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) is an important tropical evergreen tree known for its fragrant heartwood-derived essential oil and its valuable carving wood. Here, we applied an integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approach to assemble and annotate the Indian sandalwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing resulted in the establishment of a draft map of the smallest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e for any woody tree species to date (221 Mb). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e annotation predicted 38,119 protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and 27.42% repetitive DNA elements. In-depth proteome analysis revealed the identities of 72,325 unique peptides, which confirmed 10,076 of the predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. The addition of transcriptomic and proteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic approaches resulted in the identification of 53 novel proteins and 34 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-correction events that were missed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic approaches. Proteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic analysis also helped in reassigning 1,348 potential noncoding RNAs as bona fide protein-coding messenger RNAs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression patterns at the RNA and protein levels indicated that peptide sequencing was useful in capturing proteins encoded by nuclear and organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es alike. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic evidence provided an unbiased approach toward the identification of proteins encoded by organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Such proteins are often missed in transcriptome data sets due to the enrichment of only messenger RNAs that contain poly(A) tails. Overall, the use of integrated omic approaches enhanced the quality of the assembly and annotation of this nonmodel plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. The availability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data will enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics-assisted breeding, germplasm characterization, and conservation of sandalwood trees.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is a ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e termed extra circular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell hetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al variants with multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rate the observed soma cell hetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> integration into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

The Roles of Mutation, Selection, and Expression in Determining Relative Rates of Evolution in Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genomes
<p>Eukaryotes rely on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, which interact within multisubunit complexes such as oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes. Although selection is thought to be less efficient on the asexual mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, in bilaterian animals the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<i>ω</i>) is lower in mt- compared with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, suggesting <i>stronger</i> effects of purifying selection in the mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Because high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression constrain protein sequence evolution, one proposed resolution to this paradox is that mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are expressed more highly than nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. To test this hypothesis, we investigated expression and sequence evolution of mt and nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from 84 diverse eukaryotes that vary in mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> content and mutation rate. We found that the relationship between mt and nuclear <i>ω</i> values varied dramatically across eukaryotes. In contrast, transcript abundance is consistently higher for mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s than nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, regardless of which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s happen to be in the mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Consequently, expression levels cannot be responsible for the differences in <i>ω</i>. Rather, 84% of the variance in the ratio of <i>ω</i> values between mt and nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s could be explained by differences in mutation rate between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We relate these findings to the hypothesis that high rates of mt mutation select for compensatory changes in the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. We also propose an explanation for why mt transcripts consistently outnumber their nuclear counterparts, with implications for mitonuclear protein imbalance and aging.</p>

Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional differentiation of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and is thus a crucial step in the process of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which diverged from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es based on comparative analyses of these divergent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e-wide differentiation patterns and phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es were extensively differentiated before the divergence of these lineages. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al regions exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic differentiation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution.</p>

Female Mice With an XY Sex Chromosome Complement Develop Severe Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a deadly pathology with strong sexual dimorphism. Similar to humans, female mice exhibit far lower incidences of angiotensin II–induced AAAs than males. In addition to sex hormones, the X and Y sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, and their unique complements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, may contribute to sexually dimorphic AAA pathology.

The majority of aortic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> differences in XY versus XX females fell within inflammatory pathways. AAA incidences doubled and aneurysms ruptured in XY females. AAAs from XY females exhibited inflammation, and plasma interleukin-1β concentrations were increased in XY females. Moreover, aortas from XY females had augmented matrix metalloproteinase activity and increased oxidative stress.

When XY females were exposed to testosterone, aneurysm rupture rates were striking. Mechanisms for augmented AAA severity in XY females include increased inflammation, augmented matrix metalloproteineases, and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on the sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es regulate aortic vascular biology and contribute to sexual dimorphism of AAAs.

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics into the forest sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e and the availability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Transcriptomic Insights into Phenological Development and Cold Tolerance of Wheat Grown in the Field
<p>Cold acclimation and winter survival in cereal species is determined by complicated environmentally regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression. However, studies investigating these complex cold responses are mostly conducted in controlled environments that only consider the responses to single environmental variables. In this study, we have comprehensively profiled global transcriptional responses in crowns of field-grown spring and winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) genotypes and their near-isogenic lines with the <i>VRN-A1</i> alleles swapped. This in-depth analysis revealed multiple signaling, interactive pathways that influence cold tolerance and phenological development to optimize plant growth and development in preparation for a wide range of over-winter stresses. Investigation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic differences at the <i>VRN-A1</i> locus revealed that a vernalization requirement maintained a higher level of cold response pathways while <i>VRN-A1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically promoted floral development. Our results also demonstrated the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic background on the expression of cold and flowering pathways. The link between delayed shoot apex development and the induction of cold tolerance was reflected by the gradual up-regulation of abscisic acid-dependent and C-REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR pathways. This was accompanied by the down-regulation of key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in meristem development as the autumn progressed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e location of differentially expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the winter and spring wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds showed a striking pattern of biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es 6A and 6D, indicating a transcriptional regulation at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e level. This finding adds to the complexity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic cascades and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> interactions that determine the evolutionary patterns of both phenological development and cold tolerance traits in wheat.</p>

Hierarchically Aligning 10 Legume Genomes Establishes a Family-Level Genomics Platform
<p>Mainly due to their economic importance, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es of 10 legumes, including soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), wild peanut (<i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis ipaensis</i>), and barrel medic (<i>Medicago truncatula</i>), have been sequenced. However, a family-level comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics analysis has been unavailable. With grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and selected legume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es as outgroups, we managed to perform a hierarchical and event-related alignment of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and deconvoluted layers of homologous regions produced by ancestral polyploidizations or speciations. Consequently, we illustrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic fractionation characterized by widespread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> losses after the polyploidizations. Notably, high similarity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> retention between recently duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es in soybean supported the likely autopolyploidy nature of its tetraploid ancestor. Moreover, although most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> losses were nearly random, largely but not fully described by geometric distribution, we showed that polyploidization contributed divergently to the copy number variation of important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families. Besides, we showed significantly divergent evolutionary levels among legumes and, by performing synonymous nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites correction, redated major evolutionary events during their expansion. This effort laid a solid foundation for further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics exploration in the legume research community and beyond. We describe only a tiny fraction of legume comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics analysis that we performed; more information was stored in the newly constructed Legume Comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics Research Platform (<ext-link>www.legumegrp.org</ext-link>).</p>

Physical Mapping of Amplified Copies of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Glyphosate-Resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Recent and rapid evolution of resistance to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicides, in several weed species, including common waterhemp (<i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>), poses a serious threat to sustained crop production. We report that glyphosate resistance in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> was due to amplification of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-P synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, which encodes the molecular target of glyphosate. There was a positive correlation between <i>EPSPS</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> copies and its transcript expression. We analyzed the distribution of <i>EPSPS</i> copies in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> using fluorescence in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and interphase nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis mapped the <i>EPSPS</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> to pericentromeric regions of two homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es in glyphosate sensitive <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>. In glyphosate-resistant plants, a cluster of <i>EPSPS</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on the pericentromeric region on one pair of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es was detected. Intriguingly, two highly glyphosate-resistant plants harbored an additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e with several <i>EPSPS</i> copies besides the native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e pair with <i>EPSPS</i> copies. These results suggest that the initial event of <i>EPSPS</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplication may have occurred because of unequal recombination mediated by repetitive DNA. Subsequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> amplification may have resulted via several other mechanisms, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al rearrangements, deletion/insertion, transposon-mediated dispersion, or possibly by interspecific hybridization. This report illustrates the physical mapping of amplified <i>EPSPS</i> copies in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>.</p>

The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most phenotypic traits are controlled by many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, but a global picture of the genotype–phenotype map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rally how many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s affect a trait and how large these effects are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are shaped by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the reverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding yeast strains, each of which lacks a nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. We show that 1) the proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are impacted by many more small-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s than large-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and 3) the mean effect of all nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on a trait decreases precipitously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression traits in 754 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide reverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics in genotype–phenotype mapping, uncover an enormous range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic complexity of phenotypic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been shaped by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, we identified approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide data.</p>

Competing chromosomes explain junk DNA
<p>The vast majority of eukaryotes have two copies of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e and reproduce sexually. Meiosis is a vital process that produces gametes (eggs and sperm) by reducing the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e copies to one; fertilization between egg and sperm restores the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e copy number to two. During female meiosis, one set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es is expelled into a tiny cell called a polar body, whereas the other is segregated into the egg. It is a fundamental tenet of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics that there is a random, 50% chance for any particular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e to be segregated into the egg versus the polar body. However, cases in which one copy of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is inherited with greater than 50% frequency have been reported in many species (<i>1</i>), but the molecular mechanism of this preferential inheritance has remained obscure. Recent work has indicated that centromeres, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al regions that form attachments to microtubules that mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation during meiosis, compete with each other for inheritance during female meiosis (<i>2</i>). Thus, the essential DNA sequences that mediate accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation are actually “selfish” (or parasitic) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic elements that have invaded our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. On page 668 of this issue, Akera <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) provide the most detailed molecular mechanism to date that explains how a parasitic DNA sequence has used the asymmetry of oocyte meiosis to ensure its own inheritance and therefore its spread through populations.</p>

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. This inverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> interactions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

The Coiled-Coil NLR <i>Rph1</i>, Confers Leaf Rust Resistance in Barley Cultivar Sudan
<p>Unraveling and exploiting mechanisms of disease resistance in cereal crops is currently limited by their large repeat-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and the lack of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic recombination or cultivar (cv)-specific sequence information. We cloned the first leaf rust resistance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> <i>Rph1</i> (<i>Rph1</i>.<i>a</i>) from cultivated barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) using “MutChromSeq,” a recently developed molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics tool for the rapid cloning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in plants. Marker-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped <i>Rph1</i> to the short arm of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the barley cv Morex reference assembly. A sodium azide mutant population in cv Sudan was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were sequenced and compared to identify candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s for the <i>Rph1</i> locus. MutChromSeq identified a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> candidate encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger sequencing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. Phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analysis determined that <i>Rph1</i> clustered separately from all previously cloned NLRs from the Triticeae and displayed highest sequence similarity (89%) with a homolog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) disease resistance protein 1 protein in <i>Triticum urartu</i>. In this study we determined the molecular basis for <i>Rph1</i>-mediated resistance in cultivated barley enabling varietal improvement through diagnostic marker design, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> editing, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> stacking technologies.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> function. We used a combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse muta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis technologies to discover and validate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics in identifying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s is an extreme instance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression complementation, in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in B73 and 2,024 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in hybrids exceeded the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s among SPE patterns and their stability under water limitation might suggest a function of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

Evolutionary Dynamics of Abundant Stop Codon Readthrough
<p>Translational stop codon readthrough emerged as a major regulatory mechanism affecting hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, based on recent comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics and ribosomal profiling evidence, but its evolutionary properties remain unknown. Here, we leverage comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic evidence across 21 <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes to systematically annotate readthrough <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the malaria vector <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and to provide the first study of abundant readthrough evolution, by comparison with 20 <i>Drosophila</i> species. Using improved comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics methods for detecting readthrough, we identify evolutionary signatures of conserved, functional readthrough of 353 stop codons in the malaria vector, <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and of 51 additional <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> stop codons, including several cases of double and triple readthrough and of readthrough of two adjacent stop codons. We find that most differences between the readthrough repertoires of the two species arose from readthrough gain or loss in existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, rather than birth of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> death; that readthrough-associated RNA structures are sometimes gained or lost while readthrough persists; that readthrough is more likely to be lost at TAA and TAG stop codons; and that readthrough is under continued purifying evolutionary selection in mosquito, based on population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic evidence. We also determine readthrough-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> properties that predate readthrough, and identify differences in the characteristic properties of readthrough <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between clades. We estimate more than 600 functional readthrough stop codons in mosquito and 900 in fruit fly, provide evidence of readthrough control of peroxisomal targeting, and refine the phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic extent of abundant readthrough as following divergence from centipede.</p>

Expansion of Secretin-Like G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Their Peptide Ligands via Local Duplications Before and After Two Rounds of Whole-Genome Duplication
<p>In humans, the secretin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family comprises 15 members with 18 corresponding peptide ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Although members have been identified in a large variety of vertebrate and nonvertebrate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e comparisons to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e fragments with conserved synteny and matched these fragments to linkage groups in reconstructed early gnathostome ancestral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es (<i>GAC</i>). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were clustered in three <i>GAC</i> linkage groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotropin-releasing hormone-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid hormone-like, glucagon-like, and growth hormone-releasing hormone-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplications before two rounds (2R) of whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplication. These subfamily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplication, followed by additional local duplications and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loss prior to the divergence of land vertebrates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole secretin-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family with a large number of paralogs.</p>

Genetic Risk Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic basis. Identification of individuals at greatest AF risk could minimize the incidence of cardioembolic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To determine whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic data can stratify risk for development of AF, we examined associations between AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic risk scores and incident AF in 5 prospective studies comprising 18 919 individuals of European ancestry. We examined associations between AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic risk scores and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents. Scores were based on 11 to 719 common variants (≥5%) associated with AF at <i>P</i> values ranging from <1×10<sup>−3</sup> to <1×10<sup>−8</sup> in a prior independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic association study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Incident AF occurred in 1032 individuals (5.5%). AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic risk scores were associated with new-onset AF after adjustment for clinical risk factors. The pooled hazard ratio for incident AF for the highest versus lowest quartile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic risk scores ranged from 1.28 (719 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.46; <i>P</i>=1.5×10<sup>−4</sup>) to 1.67 (25 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–1.90; <i>P</i>=9.3×10<sup>−15</sup>). Discrimination of combined clinical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic risk scores varied across studies and scores (maximum C statistic, 0.629–0.811; maximum ΔC statistic from clinical score alone, 0.009–0.017). AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic risk was associated with stroke in age- and sex-adjusted models. For example, individuals in the highest versus lowest quartile of a 127-variant score had a 2.49-fold increased odds of cardioembolic stroke (95% confidence interval, 1.39–4.58; <i>P</i>=2.7×10<sup>−3</sup>). The effect persisted after the exclusion of individuals (n=70) with known AF (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–4.40; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Comprehensive AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic risk scores were associated with incident AF beyond associations for clinical AF risk factors but offered small improvements in discrimination. AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic risk was also associated with cardioembolic stroke in age- and sex-adjusted analyses. Efforts are warranted to determine whether AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic risk may improve identification of subclinical AF or help distinguish between stroke mechanisms.</p></sec>

Common Genetic Variant Risk Score Is Associated With Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-induced QT interval prolongation, a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications.

Chromatin three-dimensional interactions mediate genetic effects on gene expression

Wild emmer genome architecture and diversity elucidate wheat evolution and domestication

Gcorn Plant: A Database for Retrieving Functional and Evolutionary Traits of Plant Genes

The number of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and species registered in public databanks is continuously increasing. It is useful to associate homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s of various plants to better understand plant speciation. We designed the Gcorn plant database for the retrieval of information on homology and evolution of a plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> of interest. Amino acid sequences of 73 species (62 land plants and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 sequences, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these sequences, homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> of interest, a phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic tree, connecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with high homology indices, and line charts of the numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and on a phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. Gcorn plant provides information on homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s at various virtual time points along with speciation in plants.</p>

Recursive Paleohexaploidization Shaped the Durian Genome
<p>The durian (<i>Durio zibethinus</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has recently become available, and analysis of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reveals two paleopolyploidization events previously inferred as shared with cotton (<i>Gossypium</i> spp.). Here, we reanalyzed the durian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e in comparison with other well-characterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We found that durian and cotton were actually affected by different polyploidization events: hexaploidization in durian ∼19–21 million years ago (mya) and decaploidization in cotton ∼13–14 mya. Previous interpretations of shared polyploidization events may have resulted from the elevated evolutionary rates in cotton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s due to the decaploidization and insufficient consideration of the complexity of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The decaploidization elevated evolutionary rates of cotton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s by ∼64% compared to durian and explained a previous ∼4-fold over dating of the event. In contrast, the hexaploidization in durian did not prominently elevate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> evolutionary rates, likely due to its long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration time. Moreover, divergent evolutionary rates probably explain 98.4% of reconstructed phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic trees of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s being incongruent with expected topology. The findings provide further insight into the roles played by polypoidization in the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and they suggest revisiting existing reconstructed phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic trees.</p>

Monophyletic Origin and Evolution of the Largest Crucifer Genomes
<p>Clade E, or the <i>Hesperis</i> clade, is one of the major Brassicaceae (Crucifereae) clades, comprising some 48 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ra and 351 species classified into seven tribes and is distributed predominantly across arid and montane regions of Asia. Several taxa have socioeconomic significance, being important ornamental but also weedy and invasive species. From the comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic perspective, the clade is noteworthy as it harbors species with the largest crucifer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es but low numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es (<i>n</i> = 5–7). By applying comparative cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analysis and whole-chloroplast phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics, we constructed, to our knowledge, the first partial and complete cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic maps for selected representatives of clade E tribes and investigated their relationships in a family-wide context. The <i>Hesperis</i> clade is a well-supported monophyletic lineage comprising seven tribes: Anchonieae, Buniadeae, Chorisporeae, Dontostemoneae, Euclidieae, Hesperideae, and Shehbazieae. The clade diverged from other Brassicaceae crown-group clades during the Oligocene, followed by subsequent Miocene tribal diversifications in central/southwestern Asia. The inferred ancestral karyotype of clade E (CEK; <i>n</i> = 7) originated from an older <i>n</i> = 8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, which also was the purported progenitor of tribe Arabideae (KAA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e). In most taxa of clade E, the seven linkage groups of CEK either remained conserved (Chorisporeae) or were reshuffled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al translocations (Euclidieae). In 50% of Anchonieae and Hesperideae species, the CEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has undergone descending dysploidy toward <i>n</i> = 6 (−5). These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic data elucidate early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution in Brassicaceae and pave the way for future whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing and assembly efforts in this as yet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ically neglected group of crucifer plants.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic enzymes, pathways, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters from a sequenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Using this pipeline, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and identified metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rate a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e organization that implicate local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplication and, to a lesser extent, single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters.</p>

<p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is homologous recombination, which promotes homologous pairing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rates crossovers (COs) to connect homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding program depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e size. Moreover, their positions are not random on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es but exhibit regional preference. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding programs. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in the process in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic feature for many crop plants.</p>

Atypical Protein Phosphatase 2A Gene Families Do Not Expand via Paleopolyploidization
<p>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) presents unique opportunities for analyzing molecular mechanisms of functional divergence between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family members. The canonical PP2A holoenzyme regulates multiple eukaryotic signaling pathways by dephosphorylating target proteins and contains a catalytic (C) subunit, a structural/scaffolding (A) subunit, and a regulatory (B) subunit. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding PP2A subunits have expanded into multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in both flowering plants and mammals, and the extent to which different isoform functions may overlap is not clearly understood. To gain insight into the diversification of PP2A subunits, we used phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of PP2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding PP2A subunits in mammals represent ancient lineages that expanded early in vertebrate evolution, while flowering plant PP2A subunit lineages evolved much more recently. Despite this temporal difference, our data indicate that the expansion of PP2A subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in both flowering plants and animals was driven by whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplications followed by nonrandom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loss. Selection analysis suggests that the expansion of one B subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family (B56/PPP2R5) was driven by functional diversification rather than by the maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> dosage. We also observed reduced expansion rates in three distinct B subunit subclades. One of these subclades plays a highly conserved role in cell division, while the distribution of a second subclade suggests a specialized function in supporting beneficial microbial associations. Thus, while whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplications have driven the expansion and diversification of most PP2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families, members of functionally specialized subclades quickly revert to singleton status after duplication events.</p>

The Genomes of Two Bat Species with Long Constant Frequency Echolocation Calls
<p>Bats can perceive the world by using a wide range of sensory systems, and some of the systems have become highly specialized, such as auditory sensory perception. Among bat species, the Old World leaf-nosed bats and horseshoe bats (rhinolophoid bats) possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems. Here, we reported the whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing and <i>de novo</i> assembles of two rhinolophoid bats—the great leaf-nosed bat (<i>Hipposideros armiger</i>) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus sinicus</i>). Comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic analyses revealed the adaptation of auditory sensory perception in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some vision-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in rhinolophoid bats was observed, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive contraction of olfactory receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> contractions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> might have direct consequences for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-sequenced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of 20 great leaf-nosed bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, evidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic adaptations to high altitudes in the great leaf-nosed bats was observed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the evolution of bats.</p>

The Evolution of Innate Immune Genes: Purifying and Balancing Selection on β-Defensins in Waterfowl
<p>In disease dynamics, high immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> diversity can confer a selective advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were characterized in mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) and other waterfowl; key reservoir species for many zoonotic diseases. All five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific β-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being fixed across all species investigated. Purifying selection to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for balancing selection acting on the most recently duplicated β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>AvBD3b</i>). For this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s allows exploration of wider functional space. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian β-defensin effector molecules, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, such as receptor and signalling molecules, where balancing selection to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. We compare the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Correlation between genome reduction and bacterial growth
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reduction by removing dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences in bacteria is commonly used in both fundamental and applied studies to determine the minimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic requirements for a living system or to develop highly efficient bioreactors. Nevertheless, whether and how the accumulative loss of dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences disturbs bacterial growth remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reduction and growth, a series of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es reduced in a stepwise manner were used. Intensive growth analyses revealed that the accumulation of multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic deletions caused decreases in the exponential growth rate and the saturated cell density in a deletion-length-dependent manner as well as gradual changes in the patterns of growth dynamics, regardless of the growth media. Accordingly, a perspective growth model linking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e engineering was proposed. This study provides the first demonstration of a quantitative connection between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequence and bacterial growth, indicating that growth rate is potentially associated with dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences.</p>

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling

Here, we seek to understand the impact of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic variants in 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other diseases.

Primary Myocardial Fibrosis as an Alternative Phenotype Pathway of Inherited Cardiac Structural Disorders

RNA Polymerase II Read-Through Promotes Expression of Neighboring Genes in SAL1-PAP-XRN Retrograde Signaling
<p>In plants, the molecular function(s) of the nucleus-localized 5′-3′ EXORIBONUCLEASES (XRNs) are unclear; however, their activity is reported to have a significant effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression and SAL1-mediated retrograde signaling. Using parallel analysis of RNA ends, we documented a dramatic increase in uncapped RNA substrates of the XRNs in both <i>sal1</i> and <i>xrn2xrn3</i> mutants. We found that a major consequence of reducing SAL1 or XRN activity was RNA Polymerase II 3′ read-through. This occurred at 72% of expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, demonstrating a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide role for the XRN-torpedo model of transcription termination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Read-through is speculated to have a negative effect on transcript abundance; however, we did not observe this. Rather, we identified a strong association between read-through and increased transcript abundance of tandemly orientated downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, strongly correlated with the proximity (less than 1,000 bp) and expression of the upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. We observed read-through in the proximity of 903 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s up-regulated in the <i>sal1-8</i> retrograde signaling mutant; thus, this phenomenon may account directly for up to 23% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s up-regulated in <i>sal1-8</i>. Using <i>APX2</i> and <i>AT5G43770</i> as exemplars, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically uncoupled read-through loci from downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s to validate the principle of read-through-mediated mRNA regulation, providing one mechanism by which an ostensibly posttranscriptional exoribonuclease that targets uncapped RNAs could modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression.</p>

Characterization of Imprinted Genes in Rice Reveals Conservation of Regulation and Imprinting with Other Plant Species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic imprinting is an epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic phenomenon by which certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s display differential expression in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner. Hundreds of imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have been identified from several plant species. Here, we identified, with a high level of confidence, 208 imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> candidates from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s of rice showed limited association with the transposable elements, which contrasts with findings from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rally, imprinting in rice is conserved within a species, but intraspecific variation also was detected. The imprinted rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s do not show signatures of selection, which suggests that domestication has had a limited evolutionary consequence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic imprinting. Although conservation of imprinting in plants is limited, we show that some loci are imprinted in several different species. Moreover, our results suggest that different types of epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic regulation can be established either before or after fertilization. Imprinted 24-nucleotide small RNAs and their neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s tend to express alleles from different parents. This association was not observed between 21-nucleotide small RNAs and their neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Together, our findings suggest that the regulation of imprinting can be diverse, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic imprinting has evolutionary and biological significance.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic region where three candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are located. These results provide insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven stresses such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these stresses usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single stresses. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, drought, and heat stresses, as well as their double and triple stress combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-physiological acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined stresses. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat stress. Response patterns of differentially expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, under single and combined stresses (i.e. common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s), were maintained only among 37% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that were uniquely expressed only under combined stresses (i.e. combination unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under combined stresses and limited ability to predict plant responses as different stresses are combined. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> subset was enriched with different biological processes. Common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were enriched with known stress response pathways, while combination unique-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were enriched with unique processes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve stress tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal decomposition of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW decay in which lignin and carbohydrates are both degraded. Mechanistic studies of decay coupled with comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their evolutionary origins, but the complete suite of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family diversification rates that are correlated with evolution of WR, using data from 62 fungal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We detected 409 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families that appear to be evolutionarily correlated with WR. The identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families encode well-characterized decay enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as well as 73 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families are present in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results illuminate the complexity of WR and suggest that its evolution has involved a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ral elaboration of the decay apparatus, including numerous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Molecular Characterization and Evolution of a Gene Family Encoding Both Female- and Male-Specific Reproductive Proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new reproductive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same sex. To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of female reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that become “co-opted” by males, we screened female reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in males that is transferred to females during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the female reproductive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the male RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> that was female-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved male-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one female-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> is essential for full fecundity, and both female-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s contribute singly or in combination to a female’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the male-expressed paralog had no significant effect on female fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family exert effects on females by acting on a common, female-expressed target. After duplication and male co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ating in soils of greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation under different levels of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Under moderate and high soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation rates in soils with greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation rate in soils of greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>.</p>

Elongator Is Required for Root Stem Cell Maintenance by Regulating <i>SHORTROOT</i> Transcription
<p><i>SHORTROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>) is essential for stem cell maintenance and radial patterning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, but how its expression is regulated is unknown. Here, we report that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator complex, which consists of six subunits (ELP1 to ELP6), regulates the transcription of <i>SHR</i>. Depletion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator drastically reduced <i>SHR</i> expression and led to defective root stem cell maintenance and radial patterning. The importance of the nuclear localization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator for its functioning, together with the insensitivity of the <i>elp1</i> mutant to the transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation inhibitor 6-azauracil, and the direct interaction of the ELP4 subunit with the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, support the notion that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator plays important roles in transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Indeed, we found that ELP3 associates with the premessenger RNA of <i>SHR</i> and that mutation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator reduces the enrichment of RNA polymerase II on the <i>SHR</i> gene body. Moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator interacted in vivo with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4, a well-established transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation factor that is recruited to the <i>SHR</i> locus. Together, these results demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator acts in concert with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4 to regulate the transcription of <i>SHR</i>.</p>

Actin Reorganization Triggers Rapid Cell Elongation in Roots
<p>Root growth is controlled by mechanisms underlying cell division and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation, which respond to various internal and external factors. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), cells produced in the proximal meristem (PM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ate and differentiate in the transition zone (TZ) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation/differentiation zone (EDZ). Previous studies have demonstrated that endoreplication is involved in root cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation; however, the manner by which cells increase in length by more than 2-fold remains unknown. Here, we show that epidermal and cortical cells in Arabidopsis roots undergo two modes of rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation: the first rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation occurs at the border of the proximal meristem and the TZ, and the second mode occurs during the transition from the TZ to the EDZ. Our previous study showed that cytokinin signaling promotes endoreplication, which triggers the first rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Our cytological and genetic data revealed that the second rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation involves dynamic actin reorganization independent of endoreplication. Cytokinins promote actin bundling and the resultant second rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation through activating the signaling pathway involving the cytokinin receptors ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE3 (AHK3) and AHK4 and the B-type transcription factor ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR2. Our results suggest that cytokinins promote the two modes of rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation by controlling distinct cellular events: endoreplication and actin reorganization.</p>

The Energy-Signaling Hub SnRK1 Is Important for Sucrose-Induced Hypocotyl Elongation
<p>Emerging seedlings respond to environmental conditions such as light and temperature to optimize their establishment. Seedlings grow initially through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation of the hypocotyl, which is regulated by signaling pathways that integrate environmental information to regulate seedling development. The hypocotyls of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ate in response to sucrose. Here, we investigated the role of cellular sugar-sensing mechanisms in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation of hypocotyls in response to Suc. We focused upon the role of SnRK1, which is a sugar-signaling hub that regulates metabolism and transcription in response to cellular energy status. We also investigated the role of TPS1, which synthesizes the signaling sugar trehalose-6-P that is proposed to regulate SnRK1 activity. Under light/dark cycles, we found that Suc-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation did not occur in <i>tps1</i> mutants and overexpressors of KIN10 (AKIN10/SnRK1.1), a catalytic subunit of SnRK1. We demonstrate that the magnitude of Suc-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation depends on the day length and light intensity. We identified roles for auxin and gibberellin signaling in Suc-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation under short photoperiods. We found that Suc-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation under light/dark cycles does not involve another proposed sugar sensor, HEXOKINASE1, or the circadian oscillator. Our study identifies novel roles for KIN10 and TPS1 in mediating a signal that underlies Suc-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation in light/dark cycles.</p>

Coordinated Regulation of Hypocotyl Cell Elongation by Light and Ethylene through a Microtubule Destabilizing Protein<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Precise regulation of hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation is essential for plant growth and survival. Light suppresses hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation by degrading transcription factor phytochrome-interacting factor 3 (PIF3), whereas the phytohormone ethylene promotes hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation by activating PIF3. However, the underlying mechanisms regarding how these two pathways coordinate downstream effectors to mediate hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation are largely unclear. In this study, we identified the novel Microtubule-Destabilizing Protein 60 (MDP60), which plays a positive role in hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>); this effect is mediated through PIF3. Ethylene signaling up-regulates <i>MDP60</i> expression via PIF3 binding to the <i>MDP60</i> promoter. <i>MDP60</i> loss-of-function mutants exhibit much shorter hypocotyls, whereas <i>MDP60</i> overexpression significantly promotes hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation when grown in light compared to the control. MDP60 protein binds to microtubules in vitro and in vivo. The organization of cortical microtubules was significantly disrupted in <i>mdp60</i> mutant cells and <i>MDP60</i>-overexpressing seedlings. These findings indicate that MDP60 is an important mediator of hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. This study reveals a mechanism in which light and ethylene signaling coordinate <i>MDP60</i> expression to modulate hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation by altering cortical microtubules in Arabidopsis.</p>

High dislocation density–induced large ductility in deformed and partitioned steels
<p>A wide variety of industrial applications require materials with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong></span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity. Unfortunately, the strategies for increasing material <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>, such as processing to create line defects (dislocations), tend to decrease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity. We developed a strategy to circumvent this in inexpensive, medium manganese steel. Cold rolling followed by low-temperature tempering developed steel with metastable austenite grains embedded in a highly dislocated martensite matrix. This deformed and partitioned (D and P) process produced dislocation hardening but retained high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity, both through the glide of intensive mobile dislocations and by allowing us to control martensitic transformation. The D and P strategy should apply to any other alloy with deformation-induced martensitic transformation and provides a pathway for the development of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>, high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity materials.</p>

Multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles and superb mechanical behaviors of complex alloys
<p>Alloy design based on single–principal-element systems has approached its limit for performance enhancements. A substantial increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> up to gigapascal levels typically causes the premature failure of materials with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity. Here, we report a strategy to break this trade-off by controllably introducing high-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>e multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles (MCINPs) in complex alloy systems. Distinct from the intermetallic-induced embrittlement under conventional wisdom, such MCINP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>ened alloys exhibit superior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>s of 1.5 gigapascals and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity as high as 50% in tension at ambient temperature. The plastic instability, a major concern for high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> materials, can be completely eliminated by generating a distinctive multistage work-hardening behavior, resulting from pronounced dislocation activities and deformation-induced microbands. This MCINP strategy offers a paradigm to develop next-generation materials for structural applications.</p>

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) mediates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation growth of shoot tissues by promoting cell expansion. According to the acid growth theory proposed in the 1970s, auxin activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and promoting solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that auxin-induced <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation growth and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical properties, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of auxin-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of auxin for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation growth by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are specifically impaired in auxin-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. The time courses of auxin-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and auxin-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation growth were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit auxin-mediated expansion growth by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

Structure of the complete elongation complex of RNA polymerase II with basal factors
<p>In the early stage of transcription, eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) exchanges initiation factors with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation factors to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation complex for processive transcription. Here we report the structure of the Pol II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation complex bound with the basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation factors Spt4/5, Elf1, and TFIIS. Spt4/5 (the Spt4/Spt5 complex) and Elf1 modify a wide area of the Pol II surface. Elf1 bridges the Pol II central cleft, completing a “DNA entry tunnel” for downstream DNA. Spt4 and the Spt5 NGN and KOW1 domains encircle the upstream DNA, constituting a “DNA exit tunnel.” The Spt5 KOW4 and KOW5 domains augment the “RNA exit tunnel,” directing the exiting nascent RNA. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation complex establishes a completely different transcription and regulation platform from that of the initiation complexes.</p>

Colchicine-induced degeneration of the micronucleus during conjugation in <i>Tetrahymena</i>
<p>One of the most dramatic examples of nuclear morphogenesis occurs during conjugation in <i>Tetrahymena</i> when the micronucleus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ates to a size longer than the cell itself. After contraction to a spherical shape, the nucleus moves directly to chromosome separation in the first meiotic division. Here we investigate the consequences of interrupting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation process. Colchicine, a microtubule inhibitor, caused retraction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ated structures. With time, cells began to lose their micronuclei, and by five hours more than half of the paired cells had at least one cell missing a micronucleus. After reversing the colchicine block, existing micronuclei did not undergo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation again, nor did meiosis occur. These observations indicate that micronuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation is critical to subsequent meiotic division. Further, nuclear elimination occurs, which could be due to meiotic failure or possibly a problem downstream from meiosis. An analysis of the process of colchicine-induced micronuclear degeneration indicated that it was regulated by a caspase-dependent mechanism, characteristic of apoptosis, and then resorbed by a lysosome-dependent autophagic mechanism. Amicronucleate cells failed to grow when returned to nutrient medium, likely because of a lesion in the post-conjugation reconstruction of a functioning oral apparatus. The ease by which a large number of nuclei are induced to “self-destruct” may make this system useful in investigating the link between colchicine treatment and nuclear death in <i>Tetrahymena</i>, and in investigating how nuclear death could be regulated in living cells more generally. Finally, we note that this phenomenon might relate to the evolution of amicronucleate species of <i>Tetrahymena</i>.</p>

Precipitation strengthening of aluminum alloys by room-temperature cyclic plasticity
<p>High-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> aluminum alloys are important for lightweighting vehicles and are extensively used in aircraft and, increasingly, in automobiles. The highest-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> aluminum alloys require a series of high-temperature “bakes” (120° to 200°C) to form a high number density of nanoparticles by solid-state precipitation. We found that a controlled, room-temperature cyclic deformation is sufficient to continuously inject vacancies into the material and to mediate the dynamic precipitation of a very fine (1- to 2-nanometer) distribution of solute clusters. This results in better material <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation properties relative to traditional thermal treatments, despite a much shorter processing time. The microstructures formed are much more uniform than those characteristic of traditional thermal treatments and do not exhibit precipitate-free zones.

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>e by specific dilute solute additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued plastic straining during deformation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity as a function of alloy composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium alloys, and the solute-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium.

Synthetic transcription elongation factors license transcription across repressive chromatin
<p>The release of paused RNA polymerase II into productive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation is highly regulated, especially at genes that affect human development and disease. To exert control over this rate-limiting step, we designed sequence-specific synthetic transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation factors (Syn-TEFs). These molecules are composed of programmable DNA-binding ligands flexibly tethered to a small molecule that engages the transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation machinery. By limiting activity to targeted loci, Syn-TEFs convert constituent modules from broad-spectrum inhibitors of transcription into gene-specific stimulators. Here we present Syn-TEF1, a molecule that actively enables transcription across repressive GAA repeats that silence frataxin expression in Friedreich’s ataxia, a terminal neurodegenerative disease with no effective therapy. The modular design of Syn-TEF1 defines a general framework for developing a class of molecules that license transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation at targeted genomic loci.</p>

EPFL Signals in the Boundary Region of the SAM Restrict Its Size and Promote Leaf Initiation
<p>The shoot apical meristem (SAM) enables the formation of new organs throughout the life of a plant. ERECTA family (ERf) receptors restrict SAM size and promote initiation of leaves while simultaneously supporting establishment of correct phyllotaxy. In the epidermis and during organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation ERf activity is regulated by a family of Epidermal Patterning Factor-Like (EPFL) secreted Cys-rich small proteins. Here we show that ERfs play a critical role in communication between the SAM leaf boundary and the central zone in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Ectopic expression of <i>ERECTA</i> in the central zone using the <i>CLAVATA3</i> promoter is sufficient to restrict meristem size and promote leaf initiation. Genetic analysis demonstrated that four putative ligands: EPFL1, EPFL2, EPFL4, and EPFL6 function redundantly in the SAM. These genes are expressed at the SAM-leaf boundary and in the peripheral zone. Previously EPFL4 and EPFL6 have been linked with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation of aboveground organs. Here we demonstrate that EPFL1 and EPFL2 promote organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation as well. In addition, we show that expression of <i>ERECTA</i> in the central zone of the SAM has a strong impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation of internodes and pedicels and growth of leaves. These results suggest that ERfs can stimulate organ growth cell nonautonomously.</p>

The Receptor-Like Kinase AtVRLK1 Regulates Secondary Cell Wall Thickening
<p>During the growth and development of land plants, some specialized cells, such as tracheary elements, undergo secondary cell wall thickening. Secondary cell walls contain additional lignin, compared with primary cell walls, thus providing mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> and potentially improving defenses against pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms that initiate wall thickening are unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, encoded by <i>AtVRLK1</i> (<i>Vascular-Related Receptor-Like Kinase1</i>), that is expressed specifically in cells undergoing secondary cell wall thickening. Suppression of <i>AtVRLK1</i> expression resulted in a range of phenotypes that included retarded early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation of the inflorescence stem, shorter fibers, slower root growth, and shorter flower filaments. In contrast, up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> led to longer fiber cells, reduced secondary cell wall thickening in fiber and vessel cells, and defects in anther dehiscence. Molecular and cellular analyses showed that down-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> promoted secondary cell wall thickening and up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> enhanced cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation and inhibited secondary cell wall thickening. We propose that AtVRLK1 functions as a signaling component in coordinating cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation and cell wall thickening during growth and development.</p>

Sucrose Transporter Localization and Function in Phloem Unloading in Developing Stems
<p>How sucrose transporters (SUTs) regulate phloem unloading in monocot stems is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high Suc concentrations. To this end, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> SUTs SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 were characterized by determining their transport properties heterologously expressed in yeast or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and their in planta cellular and subcellular localization. The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong selectivity for Suc and high Suc affinities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at pH 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc affinity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and pH. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc affinity was independent of membrane potential and pH but supported high transport rates at neutral pH. Suc transport by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using yeast or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to sieve elements, while for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ating and recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ated internodes, SUTs also were detected in storage parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc unloading from de-energized protophloem sieve elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. Storage parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ating and recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to release Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic unloading pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into metaphloem sieve elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic unloading by bulk flow.</p>

A <i>β</i>-Ketoacyl-CoA Synthase Is Involved in Rice Leaf Cuticular Wax Synthesis and Requires a CER2-LIKE Protein as a Cofactor
<p>Cuticular waxes are complex mixtures of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, forming a natural barrier on aerial surfaces of terrestrial plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. In VLCFA biosynthesis, β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) is the key enzyme, catalyzing the first reaction in fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation and determining substrate specificity. We isolated a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>wax crystal-sparse leaf 4</i> (<i>WSL4</i>) gene using a map-based cloning strategy. <i>WSL4</i> is predicted to encode a KCS, a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CER6. Complementation of the mutant <i>wsl4-1</i> with <i>WSL4</i> genomic DNA rescued the cuticular wax-deficient phenotype, confirming the function of <i>WSL4</i>. The load of wax components longer than 30 carbons (C30) and C28 were reduced markedly in <i>wsl4-1</i> and <i>wsl4-2</i> mutants, respectively. Overexpression of <i>WSL4</i> increased the cuticular wax load in rice leaves. We further isolated a cofactor of WSL4, OsCER2, a homolog of Arabidopsis CER2, by coimmunoprecipitation and confirmed their physical interaction by split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid experiments. Expression of <i>WSL4</i> alone in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells resulted in increased C24 but did not produce VLCFAs of greater length, whereas expressing <i>OsCER2</i> alone showed no effect.

Active repression by RARγ signaling is required for vertebrate axial elongation
<p>Retinoic acid receptor gamma 2 (RARγ2) is the major RAR isoform expressed throughout the caudal axial progenitor domain in vertebrates. During a microarray screen to identify RAR targets, we identified a subset of genes that pattern caudal structures or promote axial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation and are upregulated by increased RAR-mediated repression. Previous studies have suggested that RAR is present in the caudal domain, but is quiescent until its activation in late stage embryos terminates axial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. By contrast, we show here that RARγ2 is engaged in all stages of axial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation, not solely as a terminator of axial growth. In the absence of RA, RARγ2 represses transcriptional activity <i>in vivo</i> and maintains the pool of caudal progenitor cells and presomitic mesoderm. In the presence of RA, RARγ2 serves as an activator, facilitating somite differentiation. Treatment with an RARγ-selective inverse agonist (NRX205099) or overexpression of dominant-negative RARγ increases the expression of posterior Hox genes and that of marker genes for presomitic mesoderm and the chordoneural hinge. Conversely, when RAR-mediated repression is reduced by overexpressing a dominant-negative co-repressor (c-SMRT), a constitutively active RAR (VP16-RARγ2), or by treatment with an RARγ-selective agonist (NRX204647), expression of caudal genes is diminished and extension of the body axis is prematurely terminated. Hence, gene repression mediated by the unliganded RARγ2–co-repressor complex constitutes a novel mechanism to regulate and facilitate the correct expression levels and spatial restriction of key genes that maintain the caudal progenitor pool during axial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos.</p>

Interplay of growth rate and xylem plasticity for optimal coordination of carbon and hydraulic economies in <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> trees
<p>Efficient leaf water supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and tree growth. Renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing carbon investment while growing taller, and any deficiency of carbon availability may result in increasing hydraulic constraints to water flow. Therefore, plants need to coordinate carbon assimilation and biomass allocation to guarantee an efficient and safe long-distance transport system. We tested the hypothesis that reduced branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation rates together with carbon-saving adjustments of xylem anatomy hydraulically compensate for the reduction in biomass allocation to xylem. We measured leaf biomass, hydraulic and anatomical properties of wood segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing (SG) and 10 fast growing (FG) <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> L. trees. Branches of SG trees had five times slower branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation rate (7 vs 35  cm year<sup>–1</sup>), and produced a higher leaf biomass (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). On the contrary, we found no differences between SG and FG trees in terms of leaf-specific conductivity (<i>P</i> > 0.05) and xylem safety (Ψ<sub>50</sub> ≈ −3.2  MPa). Slower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of carbon costs associated with growth, while maintaining similar leaf-specific conductivity and xylem safety.</p>

Molecular mechanism of extreme mechanostability in a pathogen adhesin
<p>High <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resili</span></strong>ence to mechanical stress is key when pathogens adhere to their target and initiate infection. Using atomic force microscopy–based single-molecule force spectroscopy, we explored the mechanical stability of the prototypical staphylococcal adhesin SdrG, which targets a short peptide from human fibrinogen β. Steered molecular dynamics simulations revealed, and single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments confirmed, the mechanism by which this complex withstands forces of over 2 nanonewtons, a regime previously associated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> of a covalent bond. The target peptide, confined in a screwlike manner in the binding pocket of SdrG, distributes forces mainly toward the peptide backbone through an intricate hydrogen bond network. Thus, these adhesins can attach to their target with exceptionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resili</span></strong>ent mechanostability, virtually independent of peptide side chains.</p>

Toughening elastomers using mussel-inspired iron-catechol complexes
<p>Materials often exhibit a trade-off between stiffness and extensibility; for example, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>ening elastomers by increasing their cross-link density leads to embrittlement and decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tough</span></strong>ness. Inspired by cuticles of marine mussel byssi, we circumvent this inherent trade-off by incorporating sacrificial, reversible iron-catechol cross-links into a dry, loosely cross-linked epoxy network. The iron-containing network exhibits two to three orders of magnitude increases in stiffness, tensile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>, and tensile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tough</span></strong>ness compared to its iron-free precursor while gaining recoverable hysteretic energy dissipation and maintaining its original extensibility. Compared to previous realizations of this chemistry in hydrogels, the dry nature of the network enables larger property enhancement owing to the cooperative effects of both the increased cross-link density given by the reversible iron-catecholate complexes and the chain-restricting ionomeric nanodomains that they form.</p>

A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient temperatures. Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm temperatures are hallmarks of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular signaling components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient temperature utilizes diverse components of the light sensing and signal transduction network to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether temperature sensing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant organs. Alternatively, temperature sensing may be confined to specific tissues or organs, which would require a systemic signal that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show organ-specific transcriptome responses to elevated temperatures and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and organ-interdependent temperature sensing and signaling. Seedling roots can sense and respond to temperature in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot temperature responses require both local and systemic processes. The induction of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation in hypocotyls requires temperature sensing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin signal. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive temperature sensor in the hypocotyl.</p>

SMALL AUXIN UP RNA62/75 Are Required for the Translation of Transcripts Essential for Pollen Tube Growth
<p>Successful pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation is critical for double fertilization, but the biological functions of pollen tube genes and the regulatory machinery underlying this crucial process are largely unknown. A previous translatomic study revealed two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAUR</i> (<i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i>) genes, <i>SAUR62</i> and <i>SAUR75</i>, whose expression is up-regulated by pollination. Here, we found that both SAUR62 and SAUR75 localized mainly to pollen tube nuclei. The siliques of homozygous <i>saur62</i> (<i>saur62/−</i>), <i>saur75</i> (<i>saur75/−</i>), and the <i>SAUR62</i>/<i>75</i> RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown line had many aborted seeds. These lines had normal pollen viability but defective in vitro and in vivo pollen tube growth, with branching phenotypes. Immunoprecipitation with transgenic SAUR62/75-GFP flowers revealed ribosomal protein RPL12 family members as potential interacting partners, and their individual interactions were confirmed further by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Polysome profiling showed reduced 80S ribosome abundance in homozygous <i>saur62</i>, <i>saur75</i>, <i>ribosomal large subunit12c</i>, and <i>SAUR62/75</i> RNAi flowers, suggesting that SAUR62/75 play roles in ribosome assembly. To clarify their roles in translation, we analyzed total proteins from RNAi versus wild-type flowers by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, revealing significantly reduced expression of factors participating in pollen tube wall biogenesis and F-actin dynamics, which are critical for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elastic properti</span></strong>es of tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Indeed, RNAi pollen tubes showed mislocalization of deesterified and esterified pectins and F-actin organization. Thus, the biological roles of SAUR62/75 and their RPL12 partners are critical in ribosomal pre-60S subunit assembly for efficient pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation and subsequent fertilization.</p>

Time-Course Transcriptomics Analysis Reveals Key Responses of Submerged Deepwater Rice to Flooding
<p>Water submergence is an environmental factor that limits plant growth and survival. Deepwater rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) adapts to submergence by rapidly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ating its internodes and thereby maintaining its leaves above the water surface. We performed a comparative RNA sequencing transcriptome analysis of the shoot base region, including basal nodes, internodes, and shoot apices of seedlings at two developmental stages from two varieties with contrasting deepwater growth responses. A transcriptomic comparison between deepwater rice cv C9285 and nondeepwater rice cv Taichung 65 revealed both similar and differential expression patterns between the two genotypes during submergence. The expression of genes related to gibberellin biosynthesis, trehalose biosynthesis, anaerobic fermentation, cell wall modification, and transcription factors that include ethylene-responsive factors was significantly different between the varieties. Interestingly, in both varieties, the jasmonic acid content at the shoot base decreased during submergence, while exogenous jasmonic acid inhibited submergence-induced internode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation in cv C9285, suggesting that jasmonic acid plays a role in the submergence response of rice. Furthermore, a targeted de novo transcript assembly revealed transcripts that were specific to cv C9285, including submergence-induced biotic stress-related genes. Our multifaceted transcriptome approach using the rice shoot base region illustrates a differential response to submergence between deepwater and nondeepwater rice. Jasmonic acid metabolism appears to participate in the submergence-mediated internode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation response of deepwater rice.</p>

Linking PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR to Histone Modification in Plant Shade Avoidance
<p>Shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) allows a plant grown in a densely populated environment to maximize opportunities to access to sunlight. Although it is well established that SAS is accompanied by gene expression changes, the underlying molecular mechanism needs to be elucidated. Here, we identify the H3K4me3/H3K36me3-binding proteins, Morf Related Gene (MRG) group proteins MRG1 and MRG2, as positive regulators of shade-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). MRG2 binds PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR7 (PIF7) and regulates the expression of several common downstream target genes, including <i>YUCCA8</i> and <i>IAA19</i> involved in the auxin biosynthesis or response pathway and <i>PRE1</i> involved in brassinosteroid regulation of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. In response to shade, PIF7 and MRG2 are enriched at the promoter and gene-body regions and are necessary for increase of histone H4 and H3 acetylation to promote target gene expression. Our study uncovers a mechanism in which the shade-responsive factor PIF7 recruits MRG1/MRG2 that binds H3K4me3/H3K36me3 and brings histone-acetylases to induce histone acetylations to promote expression of shade responsive genes, providing thus a molecular mechanistic link coupling the environmental light to epigenetic modification in regulation of hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation in plant SAS.</p>

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial gradients for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation rate, osmotic pressure, cell wall thickness, and wall mechanical compliances and coupled these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the polysaccharide composition, mobility, hydration, and intermolecular interactions of the inflorescence cell wall using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering. Force-extension curves revealed a gradient, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-scattering curves showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal gradient in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

Gibberellin Signaling Requires Chromatin Remodeler PICKLE to Promote Vegetative Growth and Phase Transitions
<p>PICKLE (PKL) is an ATP-dependent chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding domain (CHD3) chromatin remodeling enzyme in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Previous studies showed that PKL promotes embryonic-to-vegetative transition by inhibiting expression of seed-specific genes during seed germination. The <i>pkl</i> mutants display a low penetrance of the “pickle root” phenotype, with a thick and green primary root that retains embryonic characteristics. The penetrance of this pickle root phenotype in <i>pkl</i> is dramatically increased in gibberellin (GA)-deficient conditions. At adult stages, the <i>pkl</i> mutants are semidwarfs with delayed flowering time, which resemble reduced GA-signaling mutants. These findings suggest that PKL may play a positive role in regulating GA signaling. A recent biochemical analysis further showed that PKL and GA signaling repressors DELLAs antagonistically regulate hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation genes by direct protein-protein interaction. To elucidate further the role of PKL in GA signaling and plant development, we studied the genetic interaction between PKL and DELLAs using the hextuple mutant containing <i>pkl</i> and <i>della</i> pentuple (<i>dP</i>) mutations. Here, we show that PKL is required for most of GA-promoted developmental processes, including vegetative growth such as hypocotyl, leaf, and inflorescence stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation, and phase transitions such as juvenile-to-adult leaf and vegetative-to-reproductive phase. The removal of all DELLA functions (in the <i>dP</i> background) cannot rescue these phenotypes in <i>pkl</i>. RNA-sequencing analysis using the <i>ga1</i> (a GA-deficient mutant), <i>pkl</i>, and the <i>ga1 pkl</i> double mutant further shows that expression of 80% of GA-responsive genes in seedlings is PKL dependent, including genes that function in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation, cell division, and phase transitions. These results indicate that the CHD3 chromatin remodeler PKL is required for regulating gene expression during most of GA-regulated developmental processes.</p>

Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Rice atypical HLH protein <i>Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1</i>-<i>LIKE1</i> (<i>OsBUL1</i>) is preferentially expressed in the lamina joint where it controls cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation and positively affects leaf angles. <i>OsBUL1</i> knockout mutant (<i>osbul1</i>) and transgenic rice for double-stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) of <i>OsBUL1</i> produced erect leaves with smaller grains, whereas <i>OsBUL1</i> overexpressors and an activation tagging line of <i>OsBUL1</i> exhibited increased lamina inclination and grain size. Moreover, <i>OsBUL1</i> expression was induced by brassinolide (BL) and <i>osbul1</i> did not respond to BL treatment. To understand the molecular network of OsBUL1 function in rice, we isolated a novel OsBUL1-interacting protein, LO9-177, an uncharacterized protein containing a KxDL motif, and functionally studied it with respect to the lamina inclination and grain size of rice. OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation in the lamina joint of rice. Expression of <i>OsBC1</i> is also upregulated by BL and has a similar pattern to that of <i>OsBUL1</i>. Transgenic rice plants expressing <i>OsBC1</i> under the control of <i>OsBUL1</i> promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending, while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of <i>OsBC1</i> displayed reduced plant height and grain size. Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177, and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system, providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation.</p>

SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 Aides in Resilience to Salt and Drought in Freezing-Sensitive Tomato
<p>SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 (SFR2) is crucial for protecting chloroplast membranes following freezing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). It has been shown that SFR2 homologs are present in all land plants, including freezing-sensitive species, raising the question of SFR2 function beyond freezing tolerance. Similar to freezing, salt and drought can cause dehydration. Thus, it is hypothesized that in freezing-sensitive plants SFR2 may play roles in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resili</span></strong>ence to salt or drought. To test this hypothesis, <i>SlSFR2</i> RNAi lines were generated in the cold/freezing-sensitive species tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> [M82 <i>cv</i>]). Hypersensitivity to salt and drought of <i>SlSFR2</i>-RNAi lines was observed. Higher tolerance of wild-type tomatoes was correlated with the production of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol, a product of SFR2 activity. Tomato SFR2 in vitro activity is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and its optimal pH is 7.5, similar to that of Arabidopsis SFR2, but the specific activity of tomato SFR2 in vitro is almost double that of Arabidopsis SFR2. When salt and drought stress were applied to Arabidopsis, no conditions could be identified at which SFR2 was induced prior to irreversibly impacting plant growth, suggesting that SFR2 protects Arabidopsis primarily against freezing. Discovery of tomato SFR2 function in drought and salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resili</span></strong>ence provides further insights into general membrane lipid remodeling-based stress tolerance mechanisms and together with protection against freezing in freezing-resistant plants such as Arabidopsis, it adds lipid remodeling as a possible target for the engineering of abiotic stress-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resili</span></strong>ent crops.</p>

Dynamic creation and evolution of gradient nanostructure in single-crystal metallic microcubes
<p>We demonstrate the dynamic creation and subsequent static evolution of extreme gradient nanograined structures in initially near–defect-free single-crystal silver microcubes. Extreme nanostructural transformations are imposed by high strain rates, strain gradients, and recrystallization in high-velocity impacts of the microcubes against an impenetrable substrate. We synthesized the silver microcubes in a bottom-up seed-growth process and use an advanced laser-induced projectile impact testing apparatus to selectively launch them at supersonic velocities (~400 meters per second). Our study provides new insights into the fundamental deformation mechanisms and the effects of crystal and sample-shape symmetries resulting from high-velocity impacts.

3D Imaging of Tapetal Mitochondria Suggests the Importance of Mitochondrial Fission in Pollen Growth
<p>Mitochondrial fission occurs frequently in plant cells, but its biological significance is poorly understood because mutants specifically impaired in mitochondrial fission do not show obvious defects in vegetative growth. Here, we revealed that the production of viable pollen was reduced in mutants lacking one of the three main proteins involved in mitochondrial fission in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3A (DRP3A)/Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-LIKE PROTEIN2A, DRP3B, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ATED MITOCHONDRIA1 (ELM1). In <i>drp3b</i> and <i>elm1</i>, young microspores contained an abnormal number of nuclei, and mature pollen had aberrant accumulation of lipids in their coat and an irregular pollen outer wall. Because the formation of the pollen wall and coat is mainly associated with tapetal function, we used 3D imaging to quantify geometric and textural features of cells and mitochondria in the tapetum at different stages, using isolated single tapetal cells in which the in vivo morphology and volume of cells and mitochondria were preserved. Tapetal cells and their mitochondria changed in the volume and morphology at different developmental stages. Defective mitochondrial fission in the <i>elm1</i> and <i>drp3b</i> mutants caused changes in mitochondrial status, including mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation, abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure, a decrease in cross-sectional area, and a slight alteration of mitochondrial distribution, as well as a large reduction in mitochondrial density. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial fission is required for proper mitochondrial status in the tapetum and possibly in pollen as well and therefore plays an important role for the production of viable pollen.</p>

B-Box Containing Proteins BBX30 and BBX31, Acting Downstream of HY5, Negatively Regulate Photomorphogenesis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Light-mediated seedling development is coordinately controlled by a variety of key regulators. Here, we identified two B-box (BBX)-containing proteins, BBX30 and BBX31, as repressors of photomorphogenesis. ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5, a central regulator of light signaling, directly binds to the <i>G-box cis-</i>element present in the promoters of <i>BBX30</i> and <i>BBX31</i> and negatively controls their transcription levels in the light. Seedlings with mutations in <i>BBX30</i> or <i>BBX31</i> are hypersensitive to light, whereas the overexpression of <i>BBX30</i> or <i>BBX31</i> leads to hypo-photomorphogenic growth in the light. Furthermore, transgenic and phenotypic analysis revealed that the B-box domain of BBX30 or BBX31 is essential for their respective functioning in the regulation of photomorphogenic development in plants. In conclusion, BBX30 and BBX31 act as key negative regulators of light signaling, and their transcription is repressed by ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 through directly associating with their promoters.</p>

Adaption of Roots to Nitrogen Deficiency Revealed by 3D Quantification and Proteomic Analysis
<p>Rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is an important oil crop worldwide. However, severe inhibition of rapeseed production often occurs in the field due to nitrogen (N) deficiency. The root system is the main organ to acquire N for plant growth, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying rapeseed root adaptions to N deficiency. Here, dynamic changes in root architectural traits of N-deficient rapeseed plants were evaluated by 3D in situ quantification. Root proteome responses to N deficiency were analyzed by the tandem mass tag-based proteomics method, and related proteins were characterized further. Under N deficiency, rapeseed roots become longer, with denser cells in the meristematic zone and larger cells in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation zone of root tips, and also become softer with reduced solidity. A total of 171 and 755 differentially expressed proteins were identified in short- and long-term N-deficient roots, respectively. The abundance of proteins involved in cell wall organization or biogenesis was highly enhanced, but most identified peroxidases were reduced in the N-deficient roots. Notably, peroxidase activities also were decreased, which might promote root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation while lowering the solidity of N-deficient roots. These results were consistent with the cell wall components measured in the N-deficient roots. Further functional analysis using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants demonstrated that the two root-related differentially expressed proteins contribute to the enhanced root growth under N deficiency conditions. These results provide insights into the global changes of rapeseed root responses to N deficiency and may facilitate the development of rapeseed cultivars with high N use efficiency through root-based genetic improvements.</p>

Network Analysis Reveals a Role for Salicylic Acid Pathway Components in Shade Avoidance
<p>Plants have sophisticated mechanisms for sensing neighbor shade. To maximize their ability to compete for light, plants respond to shade through enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation and physiological changes. The shade avoidance response affects many different organs and growth stages, yet the signaling pathways underlying this response have mostly been studied in seedlings. We assayed transcriptome changes in response to shade across a 2-d time course in the wild type and 12 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants. The resulting temporal map of transcriptional responses to shade defines early and late responses in adult plants, enabling us to determine connections between key signaling genes and downstream responses. We found a pervasive and unexpectedly strong connection between shade avoidance and genes related to salicylic acid, suggesting salicylic acid signaling to be an important shade avoidance growth regulator. We tested this connection and found that several mutants disrupting salicylic acid levels or signaling were defective in shade avoidance. The effect of these mutations on shade avoidance was specific to petiole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation; neither hypocotyl nor flowering time responses were altered, thereby defining important stage-specific differences in the downstream shade avoidance signaling pathway. Shade treatment did not change salicylic acid levels, indicating that the mediation of shade avoidance by salicylic acid is not dependent on the modulation of salicylic acid levels. These results demonstrate that salicylic acid pathway genes also are key components of petiole shade avoidance.</p>

Evidence for the Regulation of Gynoecium Morphogenesis by <i>ETTIN</i> via Cell Wall Dynamics
<p><i>ETTIN</i> (<i>ETT</i>) is an atypical member of the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR family of transcription factors that plays a crucial role in tissue patterning in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium. Though recent insights have provided valuable information on ETT’s interactions with other components of auxin signaling, the biophysical mechanisms linking ETT to its ultimate effects on gynoecium morphology were until now unknown. Here, using techniques to assess cell-wall dynamics during gynoecium growth and development, we provide a coherent body of evidence to support a model in which ETT controls the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation of the valve tissues of the gynoecium through the positive regulation of pectin methylesterase (PME) activity in the cell wall. This increase in PME activity results in an increase in the level of demethylesterified pectins and a consequent reduction in cell wall stiffness, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation of the valves. Though similar biophysical mechanisms have been shown to act in the stem apical meristem, leading to the expansion of organ primordia, our findings demonstrate that regulation of cell wall stiffness through the covalent modification of pectin also contributes to tissue patterning within a developing plant organ.</p>

Three Auxin Response Factors Promote Hypocotyl Elongation
<p>The hormone auxin regulates growth largely by affecting gene expression. By studying Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (ARFs), we have identified three ARF proteins that are required for auxin-responsive hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Plants deficient in these factors have reduced responses to environmental conditions that increase auxin levels, including far-red-enriched light and high temperature. Despite having decreased auxin responses, the ARF-deficient plants responded to brassinosteroid and gibberellin, indicating that different hormones can act partially independently. Aux/IAA proteins, encoded by <i>IAA</i> genes, interact with ARF proteins to repress auxin response. Silencing expression of multiple <i>IAA</i> genes increased hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation, suggesting that Aux/IAA proteins modulate ARF activity in hypocotyls in a potential negative feedback loop.</p>

Functional Diversity of Diterpene Synthases in the Biofuel Crop Switchgrass
<p>Diterpenoids constitute a diverse class of metabolites with critical functions in plant development, defense, and ecological adaptation. Major monocot crops, such as maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), deploy diverse blends of specialized diterpenoids as core components of biotic and abiotic stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resili</span></strong>ence. Here, we describe the genome-wide identification and functional characterization of stress-related diterpene synthases (diTPSs) in the dedicated bioenergy crop switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>). Mining of the allotetraploid switchgrass genome identified an expansive diTPS family of 31 members, and biochemical analysis of 11 diTPSs revealed a modular metabolic network producing a diverse array of diterpenoid metabolites. In addition to <i>ent</i>-copalyl diphosphate (CPP) and <i>ent</i>-kaurene synthases predictably involved in gibberellin biosynthesis, we identified <i>syn</i>-CPP and <i>ent</i>-labda-13-en-8-ol diphosphate (LPP) synthases as well as two diTPSs forming (+)-labda-8,13<i>E</i>-dienyl diphosphate (8,13-CPP) and <i>ent-neo-</i>cis-trans-clerodienyl diphosphate (CT-CLPP) scaffolds not observed previously in plants. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the (+)-8,13-CPP and <i>ent-neo-</i>CT-CLPP synthases revealed residue substitutions in the active sites that altered product outcome, representing potential neofunctionalization events that occurred during diversification of the switchgrass diTPS family. The conversion of <i>ent</i>-CPP, <i>ent</i>-LPP, <i>syn</i>-CPP, and <i>ent-neo</i>-CT-CLPP by promiscuous diTPSs further yielded distinct labdane-type diterpene olefins and alcohols. Of these metabolites, the formation of 9β-hydroxy-<i>syn</i>-pimar-15-ene and the expression of the corresponding genes were induced in roots and leaves in response to oxidative stress and ultraviolet irradiation, indicating their possible roles in abiotic stress adaptation. Together, these findings expand the known chemical space of diterpenoid metabolism in monocot crops toward systematically investigating and ultimately improving stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resili</span></strong>ence traits in crop species.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

TCP Transcription Factors Regulate Shade Avoidance via Directly Mediating the Expression of Both <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR</i>s and Auxin Biosynthetic Genes
<p>Light quality surrounding a plant is largely determined by the density of its neighboring vegetation. Plants are able to sense shade light signals and initiate a series of adaptation responses, which is known as shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) are key factors in the SAS network by regulating the biosynthesis of multiple phytohormones and the expression of cell expansion genes. Although the protein levels of PIFs were found to be acumulated in shade, the transcriptional regulation of <i>PIFs</i> in response to such an environmental signal remains poorly understood. Here we show that TCP17 and its two closely related homologs, TCP5 and TCP13, play an important role in mediating shade-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation by up-regulating auxin biosynthesis via a PIF-dependent and a PIF-independent pathway. In constitutive white light, a <i>tcp5, 13, 17</i> triple mutant (<i>3tcp</i>) showed a subtle hypocotyl defective phenotype. In shade, however, <i>3tcp</i> showed a significantly reduced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation phenotype, indicating a positive role of TCPs in regulating SAS. Our in-depth biochemical and genetic analyses indicated that TCP17 can be significantly accumulated in shade. TCP17 binds to the promoters of <i>PIFs</i> and <i>YUCCAs</i> to indirectly or directly up-regulate auxin levels in shade. These data provide new insights into our better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of SAS in plants.</p>

Environmental and Genetic Factors Regulating Localization of the Plant Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase
<p>A P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is the primary transporter that converts ATP to electrochemical energy at the plasma membrane of higher plants. Its product, the proton-motive force, is composed of an electrical potential and a pH gradient. Many studies have demonstrated that this proton-motive force not only drives the secondary transporters required for nutrient uptake, but also plays a direct role in regulating cell expansion. Here, we have generated a transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plant expressing H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2) that is translationally fused with a fluorescent protein and examined its cellular localization by live-cell microscopy. Using a 3D imaging approach with seedlings grown for various times under a variety of light intensities, we demonstrate that AHA2 localization at the plasma membrane of root cells requires light. In dim light conditions, AHA2 is found in intracellular compartments, in addition to the plasma membrane. This localization profile was age-dependent and specific to cell types found in the transition zone located between the meristem and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation zones. The accumulation of AHA2 in intracellular compartments is consistent with reduced H<sup>+</sup> secretion near the transition zone and the suppression of root growth. By examining AHA2 localization in a knockout mutant of a receptor protein kinase, FERONIA, we found that the intracellular accumulation of AHA2 in the transition zone is dependent on a functional FERONIA-dependent inhibitory response in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Overall, this study provides a molecular underpinning for understanding the genetic, environmental, and developmental factors influencing root growth via localization of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p>

A PIF1/PIF3-HY5-BBX23 Transcription Factor Cascade Affects Photomorphogenesis
<p>Light signaling plays an essential role in controlling higher plants’ early developmental process termed as photomorphogenesis. Transcriptional regulation is a vital mechanism that is orchestrated by transcription factors and other regulatory proteins working in concert to finely tune gene expression. Although many transcription factors/regulators have been characterized in the light-signaling pathway, their interregulation remains largely unknown. Here, we show that PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3) and PIF1 transcription factors directly bind to the regulatory regions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and a B-box gene BBX23 and activate their expression in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that BBX23 and its close homolog gene BBX22 play a redundant role in regulating hypocotyl growth, and that plants overexpressing BBX23 display reduced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation under red, far-red, and blue light conditions. Intriguingly, BBX23 transcription is inhibited by light, whereas its protein is degraded in darkness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HY5 physically interacts with BBX23, and these two proteins coordinately regulate the expression of both light-induced and light-repressed genes. BBX23 is also recruited to the promoter sequences of the light-responsive genes in a partial HY5-dependent manner. Taken together, our study reveals that the transcriptional cascade consisting of PIF1/PIF3, HY5, and BBX23 controls photomorphogenesis, providing a transcriptional regulatory layer by which plants fine-tune their growth in response to changing light environment.</p>

Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i>
<p>The phytohormone auxin regulates many aspects of growth and development in land plants, but the origin and evolution of auxin signaling and response mechanisms remain largely unknown. Indeed, it remains to be investigated whether auxin-related pathways diverged before the emergence of land plants. To address this knowledge deficit, we analyzed auxin responses in the charophyte alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i> NIES-2285, whose ancestor diverged from a green algal ancestor during the evolution of land plants. This strain is the same as <i>Klebsormidium flaccidum</i> NIES-2285, for which the draft genome was sequenced in 2014, and was taxonomically reclassified as <i>K. nitens</i>. This genome sequence revealed genes involved in auxin responses. Furthermore, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was detected in cultures of <i>K. nitens</i>, but <i>K. nitens</i> lacks the central regulators of the canonical auxin-signaling pathway found in land plants. Exogenous IAA inhibited cell division and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation in <i>K. nitens</i>. Inhibitors of auxin biosynthesis and of polar auxin transport also inhibited cell division and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Moreover, exogenous IAA rapidly induced expression of a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN transcription factor. These results suggest that <i>K. nitens</i> has acquired the part of the auxin system that regulates transcription and cell growth without the requirement for the central players that govern auxin signaling in land plants.</p>

Brassinosteroid Biosynthesis Is Modulated via a Transcription Factor Cascade of COG1, PIF4, and PIF5
<p>Brassinosteroids (BRs) are essential phytohormones regulating various developmental and physiological processes during normal growth and development. <i>cog1-3D</i> (<i>cogwheel1-3D</i>) was identified as an activation-tagged genetic modifier of <i>bri1-5</i>, an intermediate BR receptor mutant in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>COG1</i> encodes a Dof-type transcription factor found previously to act as a negative regulator of the phytochrome signaling pathway. <i>cog1-3D</i> single mutants show an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ated hypocotyl phenotype under light conditions. A loss-of-function mutant or inducible expression of a dominant negative form of <i>COG1</i> in the wild type results in an opposite phenotype. A BR profile assay indicated that BR levels are elevated in <i>cog1-3D</i> seedlings. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that several key BR biosynthetic genes are significantly up-regulated in <i>cog1-3D</i> compared with those of the wild type. Two basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, <i>PIF4</i> and <i>PIF5</i>, were found to be transcriptionally up-regulated in <i>cog1-3D</i>. Genetic analysis indicated that PIF4 and PIF5 were required for COG1 to promote BR biosynthesis and hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that COG1 binds to the promoter regions of <i>PIF4</i> and <i>PIF5</i>, and PIF4 and PIF5 bind to the promoter regions of key BR biosynthetic genes, such as <i>DWF4</i> and <i>BR6ox2</i>, to directly promote their expression. These results demonstrated that COG1 regulates BR biosynthesis via up-regulating the transcription of <i>PIF4</i> and <i>PIF5</i>.</p>

Combined Experimental and Computational Approaches Reveal Distinct pH Dependence of Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors
<p>The fine-tuning of the degree of methylesterification of cell wall pectin is a key to regulating cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation and ultimately the shape of the plant body. Pectin methylesterification is spatiotemporally controlled by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; 66 members in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]). The comparably large number of proteinaceous pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs; 76 members in Arabidopsis) questions the specificity of the PME-PMEI interaction and the functional role of such abundance. To understand the difference, or redundancy, between PMEIs, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the behavior of two PMEIs that are coexpressed and have distinct effects on plant development: AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9. Simulations revealed the structural determinants of the pH dependence for the interaction of these inhibitors with AtPME3, a major PME expressed in roots. Key residues that are likely to play a role in the pH dependence were identified. The predictions obtained from MD simulations were confirmed in vitro, showing that AtPMEI9 is a stronger, less pH-independent inhibitor compared with AtPMEI4. Using pollen tubes as a developmental model, we showed that these biochemical differences have a biological significance. Application of purified proteins at pH ranges in which PMEI inhibition differed between AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9 had distinct consequences on pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Therefore, MD simulations have proven to be a powerful tool to predict functional diversity between PMEIs, allowing the discovery of a strategy that may be used by PMEIs to inhibit PMEs in different microenvironmental conditions and paving the way to identify the specific role of PMEI diversity in muro.</p>

SHADE AVOIDANCE 4 Is Required for Proper Auxin Distribution in the Hypocotyl
<p>The phytohormone auxin is involved in virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. Through polar auxin transport, auxin gradients can be established, which then direct plant differentiation and growth. Shade avoidance responses are well-known processes that require polar auxin transport. In this study, we have identified a mutant, <i>shade avoidance 4</i> (<i>sav4</i>), defective in shade-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation and basipetal auxin transport. <i>SAV4</i> encodes an unknown protein with armadillo repeat- and tetratricopeptide repeat-like domains known to provide protein-protein interaction surfaces. C terminally yellow fluorescent protein-tagged SAV4 localizes to both the plasma membrane and the nucleus. Membrane-localized SAV4 displays a polar association with the shootward plasma membrane domain in hypocotyl and root cells, which appears to be necessary for its function in hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Cotransfection of SAV4 and ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) auxin transporter in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) revealed that SAV4 blocks ABCB1-mediated auxin efflux. We thus propose that polarly localized SAV4 acts to inhibit ABCB-mediated auxin efflux toward shoots and facilitates the establishment of proper auxin gradients.</p>

A Palmitic Acid Elongase Affects Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Plastidial Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Levels in Nannochloropsis
<p><i>Nannochloropsis</i> species are oleaginous eukaryotes containing a plastid limited by four membranes, deriving from a secondary endosymbiosis. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, thylakoid lipids, including monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. Fatty acids are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The production of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown process. We identified seven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ases and five desaturases possibly involved in EPA production in <i>Nannochloropsis gaditana</i>. Among the six heterokont-specific saturated FA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ases possibly acting upstream in this pathway, we characterized the highly expressed isoform <i>Δ0-ELO1</i>. Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) showed that NgΔ0-ELO1 could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ate palmitic acid. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> Δ0-elo1 mutants exhibited a reduced EPA level and a specific decrease in MGDG. In NgΔ0-elo1 lines, the impairment of photosynthesis is consistent with a role of EPA-rich MGDG in nonphotochemical quenching control, possibly providing an appropriate MGDG platform for the xanthophyll cycle. Concomitantly with MGDG decrease, the level of triacylglycerol (TAG) containing medium chain FAs increased. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, part of EPA used for MGDG production is therefore biosynthesized by a channeled process initiated at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation step of palmitic acid by Δ0-ELO1, thus acting as a committing enzyme for galactolipid production. Based on the MGDG/TAG balance controlled by Δ0-ELO1, this study also provides novel prospects for the engineering of oleaginous microalgae for biotechnological applications.</p>

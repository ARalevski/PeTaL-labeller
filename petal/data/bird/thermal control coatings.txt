A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Increased elongation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es are hallmarks of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular signaling components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e utilizes diverse components of the light sensing and signal transduction network to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant organs. Alternatively, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing may be confined to specific tissues or organs, which would require a systemic signal that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show organ-specific transcriptome responses to elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and organ-interdependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing and signaling. Seedling roots can sense and respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responses require both local and systemic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin signal. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in the hypocotyl.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of development under different ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. High ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in barley.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. To maintain activity across a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Phytochromes function as thermosensors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Plants are responsive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, and some species can distinguish differences of 1°C. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, warmer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e accelerates flowering and increases elongation growth (thermomorphogenesis). However, the mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e perception are largely unknown. We describe a major thermosensory role for the phytochromes (red light receptors) during the night. Phytochrome null plants display a constitutive warm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e response, and consistent with this, we show in this background that the warm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e transcriptome becomes derepressed at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. We found that phytochrome B (phyB) directly associates with the promoters of key target genes in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent manner. The rate of phyB inactivation is proportional to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in the dark, enabling phytochromes to function as thermal timers that integrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e information over the course of the night.</p>

Genome Wide Analysis of Fatty Acid Desaturation and Its Response to Temperature
<p>Plants modify the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of their membrane and storage lipids in order to adapt to changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. In developing seeds, this response is largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by the activities of the microsomal ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acid desaturases, FAD2 and FAD3. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regulation of desaturation has been studied at the molecular and biochemical levels, the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of this trait is poorly understood. Here, we have characterized the response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed lipids to variation in ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and found that heat inhibits both ω-6 and ω-3 desaturation in phosphatidylcholine, leading to a proportional change in triacylglycerol composition. Analysis of the 19 parental accessions of the multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population showed that significant natural variation exists in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation. A combination of quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using the MAGIC population suggests that ω-6 desaturation is largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by cis-acting sequence variants in the <i>FAD2</i> 5′ untranslated region intron that determine the expression level of the gene. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by a separate QTL on chromosome 2. The identity of this locus is unknown, but genome-wide association studies identified potentially causal sequence variants within ∼40 genes in an ∼450-kb region of the QTL.</p>

The TRPM2 channel is a hypothalamic heat sensor that limits fever and can drive hypothermia
<p>Body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e homeostasis is critical for survival and requires precise regulation by the nervous system. The hypothalamus serves as the principal thermostat that detects and regulates internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. We demonstrate that the ion channel TRPM2 [of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family] is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in a subpopulation of hypothalamic neurons. TRPM2 limits the fever response and may detect increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es to prevent overheating. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation and inhibition of hypothalamic TRPM2-expressing neurons in vivo decreased and increased body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, respectively. Such manipulation may allow analysis of the beneficial effects of altered body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on diverse disease states. Identification of a functional role for TRP channels in monitoring internal body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e should promote further analysis of molecular mechanisms governing thermoregulation and foster the genetic dissection of hypothalamic circuits involved with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e homeostasis.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, represents an essential sealing component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling water and solute movement and protecting seed from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during seed development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

Integrating Omics and Alternative Splicing Reveals Insights into Grape Response to High Temperature
<p>Heat stress is one of the primary abiotic stresses that limit crop production. Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a cultivated fruit with high economic value throughout the world, with its growth and development often influenced by high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Alternative splicing (AS) is a widespread phenomenon increasing transcriptome and proteome diversity. We conducted high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e treatments (35°C, 40°C, and 45°C) on grapevines and assessed transcriptomic (especially AS) and proteomic changes in leaves. We found that nearly 70% of the genes were alternatively spliced under high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Intron retention (IR), exon skipping, and alternative donor/acceptor sites were markedly induced under different high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Among all differential AS events, IR was the most abundant up- and down-regulated event. Moreover, the occurrence frequency of IR events at 40°C and 45°C was far higher than at 35°C. These results indicated that AS, especially IR, is an important posttranscriptional regulatory event during grape leaf responses to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Proteomic analysis showed that protein levels of the RNA-binding proteins SR45, SR30, and SR34 and the nuclear ribonucleic protein U1A gradually rose as ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e increased, which revealed a reason why AS events occurred more frequently under high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. After integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, we found that heat shock proteins and some important transcription factors such as MULTIPROTEIN BRIDGING FACTOR1c and HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A2 were involved mainly in heat tolerance in grape through up-regulating transcriptional (especially modulated by AS) and translational levels. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for grape leaf responses to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e at simultaneous transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels.</p>

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of elevated ozone (1.4× ambient) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e elevation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Photoperiod and temperature responses of bud swelling and bud burst in four temperate forest tree species
<p>Spring phenology of temperate forest trees is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The release from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod. We investigated the response of early spring phenology to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod at different stages of dormancy release in cuttings from four temperate tree species in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud swelling and bud growth in <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L., <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Mattuschka) Liebl. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy release, the onset and duration of the bud swelling prior to bud burst are driven by concurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod, while the maximum growth rate is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e dependent only, except for <i>Fagus</i>, where long photoperiods also increased bud growth rates. Similarly, the later bud burst was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod (in the photoperiod sensitive species <i>Fagus, Quercus</i> and <i>Picea</i>). We conclude that photoperiod is involved in the release of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud burst in trees that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud swelling period that precedes and defines later phenological stages such as canopy greening in conventional phenological works. It is the early bud growth resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of tree phenology at a large scale. Classic spring phenology events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here.</p>

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the seed mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole seed. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage formation.</p>

Awake1, an ABC-Type Transporter, Reveals an Essential Role for Suberin in the Control of Seed Dormancy
<p>The mother plant plays an important dynamic role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of dormancy of her progeny seed in response to environmental signals. In order to further understand the mechanisms by which this dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> takes place in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we conducted a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants that fail to enter dormancy in response to variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e during seed set. We show that, for the first of these mutants, designated <i>awake1</i>, the maternal allele is required for entry into strongly dormant states and that <i>awake1</i> mutants show seed phenotypes shown previously to be associated with the loss of suberin in the seed. We identify <i>awake1</i> as an allele of <i>ABCG20</i>, an ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene required for the transport of fatty acids during suberin deposition, and show that further suberin-deficient mutants have seed dormancy defects. Seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin composition is affected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e during seed maturation, but this response appears to be independent of ABCG20. We conclude that seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin is essential for seed dormancy imposition by low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and that the exclusion of oxygen and water from the seed by the suberin and tannin layers is important for dormancy imposition.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (2°C) below and above their habitat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

Feedback regulation of COOLAIR expression controls seed dormancy and flowering time
<p>Plants integrate seasonal signals, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and day length, to optimize the timing of developmental transitions. Seasonal sensing requires the activity of two proteins, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> certain developmental transitions in plants. During reproductive development, the mother plant uses FLC and FT to modulate progeny seed dormancy in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. We found that for regulation of seed dormancy, <i>FLC</i> and <i>FT</i> function in opposite configuration to how those same genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> time to flowering. For seed dormancy, FT regulates seed dormancy through <i>FLC</i> gene expression and regulates chromatin state by activating antisense <i>FLC</i> transcription. Thus, in <i>Arabidopsis</i> the same genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led in opposite format regulate flowering time and seed dormancy in response to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e changes that characterize seasons.</p>

Enhanced thermal stability of nanograined metals below a critical grain size
<p>The limitation of nanograined materials is their strong tendency to coarsen at elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. As grain size decreases into the nanoscale, grain coarsening occurs at much lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es, as low as ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es for some metals. We discovered that nanometer-sized grains in pure copper and nickel produced from plastic deformation at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es exhibit notable thermal stability below a critical grain size. The instability <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e rises substantially at smaller grain sizes, and the nanograins remain stable even above the recrystallization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es of coarse grains. The inherent thermal stability of nanograins originates from an autonomous grain boundary evolution to low-energy states due to activation of partial dislocations in plastic deformation.</p>

Temperature-Induced Remodeling of the Photosynthetic Machinery Tunes Photosynthesis in the Thermophilic Alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i>
<p>The thermophilic alga <i>C. merolae</i> thrives in extreme environments (low pH and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e between 40°C and 56°C). In this study, we investigated the acclimation process of the alga to a colder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (25°C). A long-term cell growth experiment revealed an extensive remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus in the first 250 h of acclimation, which was followed by cell growth to an even higher density than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> (grown at 42°C) cell density. Once the cells were shifted to the lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, the proteins of the light-harvesting antenna were greatly down-regulated and the phycobilisome composition was altered. The amount of PSI and PSII subunits was also decreased, but the chlorophyll to photosystems ratio remained unchanged. The 25°C cells possessed a less efficient photon-to-oxygen conversion rate and require a 2.5 times higher light intensity to reach maximum photosynthetic efficiency. With respect to chlorophyll, however, the photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate of the 25°C culture was 2 times higher than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. Quantitative proteomics revealed that acclimation requires, besides remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus, also adjustment of the machinery for protein folding, degradation, and homeostasis. In summary, these remodeling processes tuned photosynthesis according to the demands placed on the system and revealed the capability of <i>C. merolae</i> to grow under a broad range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es.</p>

Trans-generational plasticity in physiological thermal tolerance is modulated by maternal pre-reproductive environment in the polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i>
<p>Maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its effect on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i> to investigate the influence of maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30°C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24°C and then exposed to 18 or 30°C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24°C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother–offspring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30°C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother–offspring environments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-generational effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on physiological performance characterised by a high context dependency, and are discussed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences.</p>

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of carbohydrate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es on the carbohydrate concentrations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large increases in the sorbitol concentration of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responses. When trees were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling accumulation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol accumulation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling accumulation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling accumulation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e effects more closely, we compared the carbohydrate concentrations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol concentration in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es when sufficient chilling accumulated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total carbohydrate concentration of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of accumulated chilling. Instead, as chilling accumulated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that carbohydrates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol accumulation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total carbohydrate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responses on carbohydrate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

The histone demethylase KDM6B regulates temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sex determination is a notable model of phenotypic plasticity. In many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> (<i>T. scripta</i>), the individual’s sex is determined by the ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e during egg incubation. In this study, we show that the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase KDM6B exhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sexually dimorphic expression in early <i>T. scripta</i> embryos before the gonad is distinct. Knockdown of <i>Kdm6b</i> at 26°C (a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e at which all offspring develop into males) triggers male-to-female sex reversal in >80% of surviving embryos. KDM6B directly promotes the transcription of the male sex-determining gene <i>Dmrt1</i> by eliminating the trimethylation of H3K27 near its promoter. Additionally, overexpression of <i>Dmrt1</i> is sufficient to rescue the sex reversal induced by disruption of <i>Kdm6b</i>. This study establishes causality and a direct genetic link between epigenetic mechanisms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sex determination in a turtle species.</p>

Phytochrome B integrates light and temperature signals in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, but its sensors are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the phytochrome B (phyB) photoreceptor participates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e perception through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent reversion from the active Pfr state to the inactive Pr state. Increased rates of thermal reversion upon exposing <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings to warm environments reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool of phyB and the size of the associated nuclear bodies, even in daylight. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals. We therefore propose that in addition to its photoreceptor functions, phyB is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in plants.</p>

Modulating Protein Stability to Switch Toxic Protein Function On and Off in Living Cells
<p>Toxic proteins are prime targets for molecular farming (the generation of pharmacologically active or biotechnologically usable compounds in plants) and are also efficient tools for targeted cell ablation in genetics, developmental biology, and biotechnology. However, achieving conditional activity of cytotoxins and maintaining the toxin-expressing plants as stably transformed lines remain challenging. Here, we produce a switchable version of the highly cytotoxic bacterial RNase barnase by fusing the protein to a portable protein degradation cassette, the low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e degron cassette. This method allows conditional genetics based on conditional protein degradation via the N-end rule or N-degron pathway and has been used to vice versa accumulate and/or deplete a diverse variety of highly active, unstable or stable target proteins in different living multicellular organisms and cell systems. Moreover, we expressed the barnase fusion under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the trichome-specific <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> promoter. This enabled efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of protein accumulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf hairs (trichomes). By tuning the levels of the protein, we were able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the fate of trichomes in vivo. The on-demand formation of trichomes through manipulating the balance between stabilization and destabilization of barnase provides proof of concept for a robust and powerful tool for conditional switchable cell arrest. We present this tool as a potential strategy for the manufacture and accumulation of cytotoxic proteins and toxic high-value products in plants or for conditional genetic cell ablation.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average plant oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p>Drought stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced water availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in water-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to drought stress through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of stomatal aperture and water transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the drought tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by drought stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved water use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led drought-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> and water-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by birth year, sex, and county with 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden.

The mean follow-up was 27 years. The risk of developing AF was 21.99 times higher (95% confidence interval, 19.26–25.12) in patients with CHD than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> subjects. According to a hierarchical CHD classification, patients with conotruncal defects had the highest risk (hazard ratio, 84.27; 95% confidence interval, 56.86–124.89). At the age of 42 years, 8.3% of all patients with CHD had a recorded diagnosis of AF.

Transcatheter Interatrial Shunt Device for the Treatment of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (REDUCE LAP-HF I [Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In nonrandomized, open-label studies, a transcatheter interatrial shunt device (IASD, Corvia Medical) was associated with lower pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), fewer symptoms, and greater quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure (HF) and midrange or preserved ejection fraction (EF ≥40%). We conducted the first randomized sham-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial to evaluate the IASD in HF with EF ≥40%.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REDUCE LAP-HF I (Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure) was a phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, blinded multicenter trial in patients with New York Heart Association class III or ambulatory class IV HF, EF ≥40%, exercise PCWP ≥25 mm Hg, and PCWP-right atrial pressure gradient ≥5 mm Hg. Participants were randomized (1:1) to the IASD versus a sham procedure (femoral venous access with intracardiac echocardiography but no IASD placement). The participants and investigators assessing the participants during follow-up were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary effectiveness end point was exercise PCWP at 1 month. The primary safety end point was major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal events at 1 month. PCWP during exercise was compared between treatment groups using a mixed-effects repeated measures model analysis of covariance that included data from all available stages of exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 94 patients were enrolled, of whom 44 met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were randomized to the IASD (n=22) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> (n=22) groups.

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have a far worse prognosis than those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). In the intact heart, SSc-PAH exhibits depressed rest and reserve right ventricular (RV) contractility compared with IPAH. We tested whether this disparity involves underlying differences in myofilament function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac myocytes were isolated from RV septal endomyocardial biopsies from patients with SSc-PAH, IPAH, or SSc with exertional dyspnea but no resting PAH (SSc-d); <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> RV septal tissue was obtained from nondiseased donor hearts (6–7 per group). Isolated myocyte passive length-tension and developed tension-calcium relationships were determined and correlated with in vivo RV function and reserve. RV septal fibrosis was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocyte passive stiffness from length-tension relations was similarly increased in IPAH and SSc-PAH compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, although SSc-PAH biopsies had more interstitial fibrosis. More striking disparities were found between active force-calcium relations. Compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s, maximal calcium-activated force (F<sub>max</sub>) was 28% higher in IPAH but 37% lower in SSc-PAH. F<sub>max</sub> in SSc-d was intermediate between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> and SSc-PAH. The calcium concentration required for half-maximal force (EC<sub>50</sub>) was similar between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, IPAH, and SSc-d but lower in SSc-PAH. This disparity disappeared in myocytes incubated with the active catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Myocyte F<sub>max</sub> directly correlated with in vivo RV contractility assessed by end-systolic elastance (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.46, <i>P</i>=0.002) and change in end-systolic elastance with exercise (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.49, <i>P</i>=0.008) and was inversely related with exercise-induced chamber dilation (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.63, <i>P</i><0.002), which also was a marker of depressed contractile reserve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A primary defect in human SSc-PAH resides in depressed sarcomere function, whereas this is enhanced in IPAH. These disparities correlate with in vivo RV contractility and contractile reserve and are consistent with worse clinical outcomes in SSc-PAH. The existence of sarcomere disease before the development of resting PAH in patients with SSc-d suggests that earlier identification and intervention may prove useful.</p></sec>

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction.

In a prospective, parallel group, randomized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves.

MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 Controls Cell Fate Transition during Stomatal Development
<p>Stomata on the plant epidermis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> gas and water exchange and are formed by MAPK-dependent processes. Although the contribution of MAP KINASE3 (MPK3) and MPK6 (MPK3/MPK6) to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of stomatal patterning and differentiation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) has been examined extensively, how they are inactivated and regulate distinct stages of stomatal development is unknown. Here, we identify a dual-specificity phosphatase, MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1), which promotes stomatal cell fate transition by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling MAPK activation at the early stage of stomatal development. Loss of function of <i>MKP1</i> creates clusters of small cells that fail to differentiate into stomata, resulting in the formation of patches of pavement cells. We show that MKP1 acts downstream of YODA (a MAPK kinase kinase) but upstream of MPK3/MPK6 in the stomatal signaling pathway and that MKP1 deficiency causes stomatal signal-induced MAPK hyperactivation in vivo. By expressing MKP1 in the three discrete cell types of stomatal lineage, we further identified that MKP1-mediated deactivation of MAPKs in early stomatal precursor cells directs cell fate transition leading to stomatal differentiation. Together, our data reveal the important role of MKP1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling MAPK signaling specificity and cell fate decision during stomatal development.</p>

Transcription Factor-Mediated Control of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Vegetative Tissues
<p>Plants accumulate secondary metabolites to adapt to environmental conditions. These compounds, here exemplified by the purple-colored anthocyanins, are accumulated upon high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es, UV-light, drought, and nutrient deficiencies, and may contribute to tolerance to these stresses. Producing compounds is often part of a more broad response of the plant to changes in the environment. Here we investigate how a transcription-factor-mediated program for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling anthocyanin biosynthesis also has effects on formation of specialized cell structures and changes in the plant root architecture. A systems biology approach was developed in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) for coordinated induction of biosynthesis of anthocyanins, in a tissue- and development-independent manner. A transcription factor couple from <i>Antirrhinum</i> that is known to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> anthocyanin biosynthesis was introduced in tomato under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. By application of dexamethasone, anthocyanin formation was induced within 24 h in vegetative tissues and in undifferentiated cells. Profiles of metabolites and gene expression were analyzed in several tomato tissues. Changes in concentration of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds were observed in all tested tissues, accompanied by induction of the biosynthetic pathways leading from Glc to anthocyanins. A number of pathways that are not known to be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were observed to be regulated. Anthocyanin-producing plants displayed profound physiological and architectural changes, depending on the tissue, including root branching, root epithelial cell morphology, seed germination, and leaf conductance. The inducible anthocyanin-production system reveals a range of phenomena that accompanies anthocyanin biosynthesis in tomato, including adaptions of the plants architecture and physiology.</p>

Tissue-Specific Control of the Endocycle by the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome Inhibitors UVI4 and DEL1<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The endocycle represents a modified mitotic cell cycle that in plants is often coupled to cell enlargement and differentiation. Endocycle onset is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by activity of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting cell-cycle factors for destruction. CELL CYCLE SWITCH52 (CCS52) proteins represent rate-limiting activator subunits of the APC/C. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), mutations in either <i>CCS52A1</i> or <i>CCS52A2</i> activators result in a delayed endocycle onset, whereas their overexpression triggers increased DNA ploidy levels. Here, the relative contribution of the APC/C<sup>CCS52A1</sup> and APC/C<sup>CCS52A2</sup> complexes to different developmental processes was studied through analysis of their negative regulators, being the ULTRAVIOLET-B-INSENSITIVE4 protein and the DP-E2F-Like1 transcriptional repressor, respectively. Our data illustrate cooperative activity of the APC/C<sup>CCS52A1</sup> and APC/C<sup>CCS52A2</sup> complexes during root and trichome development, but functional interdependency during leaf development. Furthermore, we found APC/C<sup>CCS52A1</sup> activity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> <i>CCS52A2</i> expression. We conclude that interdependency of CCS52A-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led APC/C activity is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led in a tissue-specific manner.</p>

Transcription Factor Interplay between LEAFY and APETALA1/CAULIFLOWER during Floral Initiation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transcription factors LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1), together with the AP1 paralog CAULIFLOWER (CAL), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the onset of flower development in a partially redundant manner. This redundancy is thought to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of a shared set of target genes. However, whether these genes are independently or cooperatively regulated by LFY and AP1/CAL is currently unknown. To better understand the regulatory relationship between LFY and AP1/CAL and to obtain deeper insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of floral initiation, we monitored the activity of LFY in the absence of AP1/CAL function. We found that the regulation of several known LFY target genes is unaffected by AP1/CAL perturbation, while others appear to require AP1/CAL activity. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that LFY and AP1/CAL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the expression of some genes in an antagonistic manner. Notably, these include key regulators of floral initiation such as <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>), which had been previously reported to be directly repressed by both LFY and AP1. We show here that <i>TFL1</i> expression is suppressed by AP1 but promoted by LFY. We further demonstrate that LFY has an inhibitory effect on flower formation in the absence of AP1/CAL activity. We propose that LFY and AP1/CAL act as part of an incoherent feed-forward loop, a network motif where two interconnected pathways or transcription factors act in opposite directions on a target gene, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the establishment of a stable developmental program for the formation of flowers.</p>

Molecular Regulation of Temperature-Dependent Floral Induction in <i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>
<p>The vegetative-to-reproductive phase change in tulip (<i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>) is promoted by increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es during spring. The warm winters of recent years interfere with this process and are calling for new adapted cultivars. A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms would be of help, but unlike the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), very little is known about floral induction in tulip. To shed light on the gene regulatory network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling flowering in tulip, RNA sequencing was performed on meristem-enriched tissue collected under two contrasting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e conditions, low and high. The start of reproductive development correlated with rounding of the shoot apical meristem and induction of <i>TGSQA</i> expression, a tulip gene with a high similarity to Arabidopsis <i>APETALA1</i>. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed the overrepresentation of genes potentially involved in floral induction, bulb maturation, and dormancy establishment. Expression analysis revealed that <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TgTFL1</i>) and <i>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1-like1</i> (<i>TgSOC1-like1</i>) might be repressors, whereas <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> likely is an activator, of flowering. Subsequently, the flowering time-associated expression of eight potential flowering time genes was confirmed in three tulip cultivars grown in the field. Additionally, heterologous functional analyses in Arabidopsis resulted in flowering time phenotypes in line with <i>TgTFL1</i> being a floral repressor and <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> being a floral activator in tulip. Taken together, we have shown that long before morphological changes occur in the shoot apical meristem, the expression of floral repressors in tulip is suppressed by increased ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es, leading either directly or indirectly to the activation of potential flowering activators shortly before the commencement of the phase change.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>s, and their expression requires seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Genetic Architecture of Flowering-Time Variation in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transition to reproductive development is a crucial step in the plant life cycle, and the timing of this transition is an important factor in crop yields. Here, we report new insights into the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of natural variation in flowering time in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a nondomesticated pooid grass closely related to cereals such as wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the rapid-flowering accession Bd21 and the delayed-flowering accession Bd1-1 were grown in a variety of environmental conditions to enable exploration of the genetic architecture of flowering time. A genotyping-by-sequencing approach was used to develop SNP markers for genetic map construction, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> differences in flowering time were identified. Many of the flowering-time QTLs are detected across a range of photoperiod and vernalization conditions, suggesting that the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of flowering within this population is robust. The two major QTLs identified in undomesticated <i>B. distachyon</i> colocalize with <i>VERNALIZATION1/PHYTOCHROME C</i> and <i>VERNALIZATION2</i>, loci identified as flowering regulators in the domesticated crops wheat and barley. This suggests that variation in flowering time is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led in part by a set of genes broadly conserved within pooid grasses.</p>

Molecular Evolution of the Yap/Yorkie Proto-Oncogene and Elucidation of Its Core Transcriptional Program
<p>Throughout Metazoa, developmental processes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by a surprisingly limited number of conserved signaling pathways. Precisely how these signaling cassettes were assembled in early animal evolution remains poorly understood, as do the molecular transitions that potentiated the acquisition of their myriad developmental functions. Here we analyze the molecular evolution of the proto-oncogene yes-associated protein (Yap)/Yorkie, a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s organ size in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals. Based on heterologous functional analysis of evolutionarily distant Yap/Yorkie orthologs, we demonstrate that a structurally distinct interaction interface between Yap/Yorkie and its partner TEAD/Scalloped became fixed in the eumetazoan common ancestor. We then combine transcriptional profiling of tissues expressing phylogenetically diverse forms of Yap/Yorkie with ChIP-seq validation to identify a common downstream gene expression program underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of tissue growth in <i>Drosophila</i>. Intriguingly, a subset of the newly identified Yorkie target genes are also induced by Yap in mammalian tissues, thus revealing a conserved Yap-dependent gene expression signature likely to mediate organ size <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> throughout bilaterian animals. Combined, these experiments provide new mechanistic insights while revealing the ancient evolutionary history of Hippo signaling.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

Light-driven fine chemical production in yeast biohybrids
<p>Inorganic-biological hybrid systems have potential to be sustainable, efficient, and versatile chemical synthesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong>s by integrating the light-harvesting properties of semiconductors with the synthetic potential of biological cells. We have developed a modular bioinorganic hybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> that consists of highly efficient light-harvesting indium phosphide nanoparticles and genetically engineered <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, a workhorse microorganism in biomanufacturing. The yeast harvests photogenerated electrons from the illuminated nanoparticles and uses them for the cytosolic regeneration of redox cofactors. This process enables the decoupling of biosynthesis and cofactor regeneration, facilitating a carbon- and energy-efficient production of the metabolite shikimic acid, a common precursor for several drugs and fine chemicals. Our work provides a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> for the rational design of biohybrids for efficient biomanufacturing processes with higher complexity and functionality.</p>

Application of Large-Scale Aptamer-Based Proteomic Profiling to Planned Myocardial Infarctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Emerging proteomic technologies using novel affinity-based reagents allow for efficient multiplexing with high-sample throughput.

Electrified methane reforming: A compact approach to greener industrial hydrogen production
<p>Electrification of conventionally fired chemical reactors has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and provide flexible and compact heat generation. Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically heated catalytic structure directly into a steam-methane–reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production. Intimate contact between the electric heat source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases catalyst utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated design with small characteristic length scales allows compact reactor designs, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong>s. Electrification of SMR offers a strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> for new reactor design, scale, and implementation opportunities. Implemented on a global scale, this could correspond to a reduction of nearly 1% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

Ultrapotent chemogenetics for research and potential clinical applications

We developed a new ion channel–based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> for cell activation and silencing that is controlled by low doses of the smoking cessation drug varenicline. We then synthesized subnanomolar-potency agonists, called uPSEMs, with high selectivity for the chemogenetic receptors. uPSEMs and their receptors were characterized in brains of mice and a rhesus monkey by in vivo electrophysiology, calcium imaging, positron emission tomography, behavioral efficacy testing, and receptor counterscreening. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> of receptors and selective ultrapotent agonists enables potential research and clinical applications of chemogenetics.</p>

Inverse-designed metastructures that solve equations

We introduce a metamaterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> capable of solving integral equations using monochromatic electromagnetic fields. For an arbitrary wave as the input function to an equation associated with a prescribed integral operator, the solution of such an equation is generated as a complex-valued output electromagnetic field.

By exploiting subwavelength-scale light-matter interactions in a metamaterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong>, our wave-based, material-based analog computer may provide a route to achieve chip-scale, fast, and integrable computing elements.</p>

Organic synthesis in a modular robotic system driven by a chemical programming language

These unit operations were implemented in a modular robotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> by using a chemical programming language that formalizes and controls the assembly of the molecules. We validated the concept by directing the automated system to synthesize three pharmaceutical compounds, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, rufinamide, and sildenafil, without any human intervention. Yields and purities of products and intermediates were comparable to or better than those achieved manually. The syntheses are captured as digital code that can be published, versioned, and transferred flexibly between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong>s with no modification, thereby greatly enhancing reproducibility and reliable access to complex molecules.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Multiplexed Gene Editing and Protein Overexpression Using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> Viral Vector
<p>Development of CRISPR/Cas9 transient gene editing screening tools in plant biology has been hindered by difficulty of delivering high quantities of biologically active single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Furthermore, it has been largely accepted that in vivo generated sgRNAs need to be devoid of extraneous nucleotides, which has limited sgRNA expression by delivery vectors. Here, we increased cellular concentrations of sgRNA by transiently delivering sgRNAs using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-derived vector (TRBO) designed with 5′ and 3′ sgRNA proximal nucleotide-processing capabilities. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we used the TRBO-sgRNA delivery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> to target GFP in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (16c) plants, and gene editing was accompanied by loss of GFP expression. Surprisingly, indel (insertions and deletions) percentages averaged nearly 70% within 7 d postinoculation using the TRBO-sgRNA constructs, which retained 5′ nucleotide overhangs. In contrast, and in accordance with current models, in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays only edited DNA when 5′ sgRNA nucleotide overhangs were removed, suggesting a novel processing mechanism is occurring in planta. Since the Cas9/TRBO-sgRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> demonstrated sgRNA flexibility, we targeted the <i>N. benthamiana NbAGO1</i> paralogs with one sgRNA and also multiplexed two sgRNAs using a single TRBO construct, resulting in indels in three genes. TRBO-mediated expression of an RNA transcript consisting of an sgRNA adjoining a GFP protein coding region produced indels and viral-based GFP overexpression. In conclusion, multiplexed delivery of sgRNAs using the TRBO system offers flexibility for gene expression and editing and uncovered novel aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 biology.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong>s have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-based Plant Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

CRISPRi-based genome-scale identification of functional long noncoding RNA loci in human cells

We further found that lncRNA knockdown can perturb complex transcriptional networks in a cell type–specific manner.

A supramolecular assembly mediates lentiviral DNA integration
<p>Retroviral integrase (IN) functions within the intasome nucleoprotein complex to catalyze insertion of viral DNA into cellular chromatin.

Dynamic creation and evolution of gradient nanostructure in single-crystal metallic microcubes
<p>We demonstrate the dynamic creation and subsequent static evolution of extreme gradient nanograined structures in initially near–defect-free single-crystal silver microcubes.

We synthesized the silver microcubes in a bottom-up seed-growth process and use an advanced laser-induced projectile impact testing apparatus to selectively launch them at supersonic velocities (~400 meters per second). Our study provides new insights into the fundamental deformation mechanisms and the effects of crystal and sample-shape symmetries resulting from high-velocity impacts.

Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Resolves Molecular Relationships Among Individual Plant Cells

Here, we describe the use of a commercially available droplet-based microfluidics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> for high-throughput scRNA-seq to obtain single-cell transcriptomes from protoplasts of more than 10,000 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root cells.

Further, distinct subpopulations and rare cell types, including putative quiescent center cells, were identified. A focused analysis of root epidermal cell transcriptomes defined developmental trajectories for individual cells progressing from meristematic through mature stages of root-hair and nonhair cell differentiation. In addition, single-cell transcriptomes were obtained from root epidermis mutants, enabling a comparative analysis of gene expression at single-cell resolution and providing an unprecedented view of the impact of the mutated genes. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of scRNA-seq in plants and provides a first-generation gene expression map of the Arabidopsis root at single-cell resolution.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

Long-Read Annotation: Automated Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Based on Long-Read cDNA Sequencing
<p>Single-molecule full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) sequencing can aid genome annotation by revealing transcript structure and alternative splice forms, yet current annotation pipelines do not incorporate such information. Here we present long-read annotation (LoReAn) software, an automated annotation pipeline utilizing short- and long-read cDNA sequencing, protein evidence, and ab initio prediction to generate accurate genome annotations. Based on annotations of two fungal genomes (<i>Verticillium dahliae</i> and <i>Plicaturopsis crispa</i>) and two plant genomes (Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>] and <i>Oryza sativa</i>), we show that LoReAn outperforms popular annotation pipelines by integrating single-molecule cDNA-sequencing data generated from either the Pacific Biosciences or MinION sequencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong>s, correctly predicting gene structure, and capturing genes missed by other annotation pipelines.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p>Plant growth and water use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving plant water use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance agricultural sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> to quantify plant size and water use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-watered and water-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of plant size and water use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of plant size given water use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing plant size, water use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil water availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of plant WUE under different watering treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Silencing <i>CAFFEOYL SHIKIMATE ESTERASE</i> Affects Lignification and Improves Saccharification in Poplar
<p>Caffeoyl shikimate esterase (CSE) was recently shown to play an essential role in lignin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and later in <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. However, the general function of this enzyme was recently questioned by the apparent lack of CSE activity in lignifying tissues of different plant species. Here, we show that down-regulation of <i>CSE</i> in hybrid poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) resulted in up to 25% reduced lignin deposition, increased levels of <i>p</i>-hydroxyphenyl units in the lignin polymer, and a relatively higher cellulose content. The transgenic trees were morphologically indistinguishable from the wild type. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a reduced abundance of several oligolignols containing guaiacyl and syringyl units and their corresponding hydroxycinnamaldehyde units, in agreement with the reduced flux toward coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol. These trees accumulated the CSE substrate caffeoyl shikimate along with other compounds belonging to the metabolic classes of benzenoids and hydroxycinnamates. Furthermore, the reduced lignin amount combined with the relative increase in cellulose content in the <i>CSE</i> down-regulated lines resulted in up to 62% more glucose released per plant upon limited saccharification when no pretreatment was applied and by up to 86% and 91% when acid and alkaline pretreatments were used. Our results show that CSE is not only important for the lignification process in poplar but is also a promising target for the development of improved lignocellulosic biomass crops for sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> biorefineries.</p>

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1
<p>In the search for renewable energy sources, genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve plant cell wall composition for biofuel and bioproducts generation. Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to engineer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thioacidolysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 coupling of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde coupling products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic acid and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively coupled into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic acid and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> industry.</p>

PaCeQuant: A Tool for High-Throughput Quantification of Pavement Cell Shape Characteristics
<p>Pavement cells (PCs) are the most frequently occurring cell type in the leaf epidermis and play important roles in leaf growth and function. In many plant species, PCs form highly complex jigsaw-puzzle-shaped cells with interlocking lobes. Understanding of their development is of high interest for plant science research because of their importance for leaf growth and hence for plant fitness and crop yield. Studies of PC development, however, are limited, because robust methods are lacking that enable automatic segmentation and quantification of PC shape parameters suitable to reflect their cellular complexity. Here, we present our new ImageJ-based tool, PaCeQuant, which provides a fully automatic image analysis workflow for PC shape quantification. PaCeQuant automatically detects cell boundaries of PCs from confocal input images and enables manual correction of automatic segmentation results or direct import of manually segmented cells. PaCeQuant simultaneously extracts 27 shape features that include global, contour-based, skeleton-based, and PC-specific object descriptors. In addition, we included a method for classification and analysis of lobes at two-cell junctions and three-cell junctions, respectively. We provide an R script for graphical visualization and statistical analysis. We validated PaCeQuant by extensive comparative analysis to manual segmentation and existing quantification tools and demonstrated its usability to analyze PC shape characteristics during development and between different genotypes. PaCeQuant thus provides a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> for robust, efficient, and reproducible quantitative analysis of PC shape characteristics that can easily be applied to study PC development in large data sets.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong>-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of oxidized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid oxidation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Quantifying Wheat Sensitivities to Environmental Constraints to Dissect Genotype × Environment Interactions in the Field
<p>Yield is subject to strong genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions in the field, especially under abiotic constraints such as soil water deficit (drought [D]) and high temperature (heat [H]). Since environmental conditions show strong fluctuations during the whole crop cycle, geneticists usually do not consider environmental measures as quantitative variables but rather as factors in multienvironment analyses. Based on 11 experiments in a field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> with contrasting temperature and soil water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to drought and heat constraints in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components. G × E interactions were separated into their underlying components, constitutive genotypic effect (G), G × D, G × H, and G × H × D, and were analyzed for two genotypes, highlighting contrasting responses to heat and drought constraints. We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviors of two strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated previously with yield components. This analysis confirmed the constitutive effect of the chromosome 1B QTL and explained the G × E interaction of the chromosome 3B QTL by a benefit of one allele when temperature rises. In addition to the method itself, which can be applied to other data sets and populations, this study will support the cloning of a major yield QTL on chromosome 3B that is highly dependent on environmental conditions and for which the climatic interaction is now quantified.</p>

Stress-Related Gene Expression Reflects Morphophysiological Responses to Water Deficit
<p>Acclimation to water deficit (WD) enables plants to maintain growth under unfavorable environmental conditions, although the mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, the natural variation of long-term acclimation to moderate and severe soil WD was investigated in 18 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions using PHENOPSIS, an automated phenotyping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong>. Soil water content was adjusted at an early stage of plant development and maintained at a constant level until reproductive age was achieved. The accessions were selected based on the expression levels of <i>ANNEXIN1</i>, a drought-related marker. Severe WD conditions had a greater effect on most of the measured morphophysiological traits than moderate WD conditions. Multivariate analyses indicated that trait responses associated with plant size and water management drove most of the variation. Accessions with similar responses at these two levels were grouped in clusters that displayed different response strategies to WD. The expression levels of selected stress-response genes revealed large natural variation under WD conditions. Responses of morphophysiological traits, such as projected rosette area, transpiration rate, and rosette water content, were correlated with changes in the expression of stress-related genes, such as <i>NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3</i> and <i>N-MYC DOWNREGULATED-LIKE1</i> (<i>NDL1</i>), in response to WD. Interestingly, the morphophysiological acclimation response to WD also was reflected in the gene expression levels (most notably those of <i>NDL1</i>, <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i>, and <i>MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN44</i>) in plants cultivated under well-watered conditions. Our results may lead to the development of biomarkers and predictors of plant morphophysiological responses based on gene expression patterns.</p>

Global Sensitivity Analysis of OnGuard Models Identifies Key Hubs for Transport Interaction in Stomatal Dynamics
<p>The physical requirement for charge to balance across biological membranes means that the transmembrane transport of each ionic species is interrelated, and manipulating solute flux through any one transporter will affect other transporters at the same membrane, often with unforeseen consequences. The OnGuard systems modeling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> has helped to resolve the mechanics of stomatal movements, uncovering previously unexpected behaviors of stomata. To date, however, the manual approach to exploring model parameter space has captured little formal information about the emergent connections between parameters that define the most interesting properties of the system as a whole. Here, we introduce global sensitivity analysis to identify interacting parameters affecting a number of outputs commonly accessed in experiments in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The analysis highlights synergies between transporters affecting the balance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> sequestration and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release pathways, notably those associated with internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and their turnover. Other, unexpected synergies appear, including with the plasma membrane anion channels and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and with the tonoplast TPK K<sup>+</sup> channel. These emergent synergies, and the core hubs of interaction that they define, identify subsets of transporters associated with free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that represent key targets to enhance plant performance in the future. They also highlight the importance of interactions between the voltage regulation of the plasma membrane and tonoplast in coordinating transport between the different cellular compartments.</p>

Hierarchically Aligning 10 Legume Genomes Establishes a Family-Level Genomics Platform
<p>Mainly due to their economic importance, genomes of 10 legumes, including soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), wild peanut (<i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis ipaensis</i>), and barrel medic (<i>Medicago truncatula</i>), have been sequenced. However, a family-level comparative genomics analysis has been unavailable. With grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and selected legume genomes as outgroups, we managed to perform a hierarchical and event-related alignment of these genomes and deconvoluted layers of homologous regions produced by ancestral polyploidizations or speciations. Consequently, we illustrated genomic fractionation characterized by widespread gene losses after the polyploidizations. Notably, high similarity in gene retention between recently duplicated chromosomes in soybean supported the likely autopolyploidy nature of its tetraploid ancestor. Moreover, although most gene losses were nearly random, largely but not fully described by geometric distribution, we showed that polyploidization contributed divergently to the copy number variation of important gene families. Besides, we showed significantly divergent evolutionary levels among legumes and, by performing synonymous nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites correction, redated major evolutionary events during their expansion. This effort laid a solid foundation for further genomics exploration in the legume research community and beyond. We describe only a tiny fraction of legume comparative genomics analysis that we performed; more information was stored in the newly constructed Legume Comparative Genomics Research Platform (<ext-link>www.legumegrp.org</ext-link>).</p>

The IQD Family of Calmodulin-Binding Proteins Links Calcium Signaling to Microtubules, Membrane Subdomains, and the Nucleus
<p>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling and dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton are essential processes for the coordination and control of plant cell shape and cell growth. Calmodulin (CaM) and closely related calmodulin-like (CML) polypeptides are principal sensors of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. CaM/CMLs decode and relay information encrypted by the second messenger via differential interactions with a wide spectrum of targets to modulate their diverse biochemical activities. The plant-specific IQ67 DOMAIN (IQD) family emerged as possibly the largest class of CaM-interacting proteins with undefined molecular functions and biological roles. Here, we show that the 33 members of the IQD family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differentially localize, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins, to multiple and distinct subcellular sites, including microtubule (MT) arrays, plasma membrane subdomains, and nuclear compartments. Intriguingly, the various IQD-specific localization patterns coincide with the subcellular patterns of IQD-dependent recruitment of CaM, suggesting that the diverse IQD members sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM signaling modules to specific subcellular sites for precise regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes. Because MT localization is a hallmark of most IQD family members, we quantitatively analyzed GFP-labeled MT arrays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells transiently expressing GFP-IQD fusions and observed IQD-specific MT patterns, which point to a role of IQDs in MT organization and dynamics. Indeed, stable overexpression of select IQD proteins in Arabidopsis altered cellular MT orientation, cell shape, and organ morphology. Because IQDs share biochemical properties with scaffold proteins, we propose that IQD families provide an assortment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> proteins for integrating CaM-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling at multiple cellular sites to regulate cell function, shape, and growth.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify genes that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about gene function. We used a combination of gene-disruption <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong>s (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of genes that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate genes found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated gene models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate genes, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three genes suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse mutagenesis technologies to discover and validate genes contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward genetics in identifying the genetic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp.

A Palmitic Acid Elongase Affects Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Plastidial Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Levels in Nannochloropsis
<p><i>Nannochloropsis</i> species are oleaginous eukaryotes containing a plastid limited by four membranes, deriving from a secondary endosymbiosis. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, thylakoid lipids, including monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. Fatty acids are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The production of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown process. We identified seven elongases and five desaturases possibly involved in EPA production in <i>Nannochloropsis gaditana</i>. Among the six heterokont-specific saturated FA elongases possibly acting upstream in this pathway, we characterized the highly expressed isoform <i>Δ0-ELO1</i>. Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) showed that NgΔ0-ELO1 could elongate palmitic acid. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> Δ0-elo1 mutants exhibited a reduced EPA level and a specific decrease in MGDG. In NgΔ0-elo1 lines, the impairment of photosynthesis is consistent with a role of EPA-rich MGDG in nonphotochemical quenching control, possibly providing an appropriate MGDG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> for the xanthophyll cycle. Concomitantly with MGDG decrease, the level of triacylglycerol (TAG) containing medium chain FAs increased. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, part of EPA used for MGDG production is therefore biosynthesized by a channeled process initiated at the elongation step of palmitic acid by Δ0-ELO1, thus acting as a committing enzyme for galactolipid production. Based on the MGDG/TAG balance controlled by Δ0-ELO1, this study also provides novel prospects for the engineering of oleaginous microalgae for biotechnological applications.</p>

A novel mouse model of Warburg Micro syndrome reveals roles for RAB18 in eye development and organisation of the neuronal cytoskeleton
<p>Mutations in <i>RAB18</i> have been shown to cause the heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM). Individuals with WARBM present with a range of clinical symptoms, including ocular and neurological abnormalities. However, the underlying cellular and molecular pathogenesis of the disorder remains unclear, largely owing to the lack of any robust animal models that phenocopy both the ocular and neurological features of the disease. We report here the generation and characterisation of a novel <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse model of WARBM. <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice are viable and fertile. They present with congenital nuclear cataracts and atonic pupils, recapitulating the characteristic ocular features that are associated with WARBM. Additionally, <i>Rab18</i>-mutant cells exhibit an increase in lipid droplet size following treatment with oleic acid. Lipid droplet abnormalities are a characteristic feature of cells taken from WARBM individuals, as well as cells taken from individuals with other neurodegenerative conditions. Neurological dysfunction is also apparent in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice, including progressive weakness of the hind limbs. We show that the neurological defects are, most likely, not caused by gross perturbations in synaptic vesicle recycling in the central or peripheral nervous system. Rather, loss of <i>Rab18</i> is associated with widespread disruption of the neuronal cytoskeleton, including abnormal accumulations of neurofilament and microtubule proteins in synaptic terminals, and gross disorganisation of the cytoskeleton in peripheral nerves. Global proteomic profiling of peripheral nerves in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice reveals significant alterations in several core molecular pathways that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in neurons. The apparent similarities between the WARBM phenotype and the phenotype that we describe here indicate that the <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse provides an important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> for investigation of the disease pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
An inducible knockout mouse to model the cell-autonomous role of PTEN in initiating endometrial, prostate and thyroid neoplasias
<p><i>PTEN</i> is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. The role of PTEN in carcinogenesis has been validated by knockout mouse models. <i>PTEN</i> heterozygous mice develop neoplasms in multiple organs. Unfortunately, the embryonic lethality of biallelic excision of <i>PTEN</i> has inhibited the study of complete <i>PTEN</i> deletion in the development and progression of cancer. By crossing PTEN conditional knockout mice with transgenic mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER<sup>T</sup> under the control of a chicken actin promoter, we have generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model that allows temporal control of <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Interestingly, administration of a single dose of tamoxifen resulted in <i>PTEN</i> deletion mainly in epithelial cells, but not in stromal, mesenchymal or hematopoietic cells. Using the mT/mG double-fluorescent Cre reporter mice, we demonstrate that epithelial-specific <i>PTEN</i> excision was caused by differential Cre activity among tissues and cells types. Tamoxifen-induced deletion of <i>PTEN</i> resulted in extremely rapid and consistent formation of endometrial <i>in situ</i> adenocarcinoma, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and thyroid hyperplasia. We also analyzed the role of PTEN ablation in other epithelial cells, such as the tubular cells of the kidney, hepatocytes, colonic epithelial cells or bronchiolar epithelium, but those tissues did not exhibit neoplastic growth. Finally, to validate this model as a tool to assay the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs in PTEN deficiency, we administered the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to mice with induced <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Everolimus dramatically reduced the progression of endometrial proliferations and significantly reduced thyroid hyperplasia. This model could be a valuable tool to study the cell-autonomous mechanisms involved in PTEN-loss-induced carcinogenesis and provides a good <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> to study the effect of anti-neoplastic drugs on PTEN-negative tumors.</p>

Metabolic Predictors of Incident Coronary Heart Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although metabolomic profiling offers promise for the prediction of coronary heart disease (CHD), and metabolic risk factors are more strongly associated with CHD in women than men, limited data are available for women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> to measure 371 metabolites in a discovery set of postmenopausal women (472 incident CHD cases, 472 controls) with validation in an independent set of postmenopausal women (312 incident CHD cases, 315 controls).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight metabolites, primarily oxidized lipids, were significantly dysregulated in cases after the adjustment for matching and CHD risk factors in both the discovery and validation data sets. One oxidized phospholipid, C34:2 hydroxy-phosphatidylcholine, remained associated with CHD after further adjustment for other validated metabolites. Subjects with C34:2 hydroxy-phosphatidylcholine levels in the highest quartile had a 4.7-fold increase in CHD odds in comparison with the lowest quartile; C34:2 hydroxy-phosphatidylcholine also significantly improved the area under the curve (<i>P</i><0.01) for CHD. The C34:2 hydroxy-phosphatidylcholine findings were replicated in a third replication data set of 980 men and women (230 cardiovascular events) with a stronger association observed in women.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data replicate known metabolite predictors, identify novel markers, and support the relationship between lipid oxidation and subsequent CHD.</p></sec>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong> for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

Large Cardiac Muscle Patches Engineered From Human Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiac Cells Improve Recovery From Myocardial Infarction in Swine
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Here, we generated human cardiac muscle patches (hCMPs) of clinically relevant dimensions (4 cm × 2 cm × 1.25 mm) by suspending cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells that had been differentiated from human induced-pluripotent stem cells in a fibrin scaffold and then culturing the construct on a dynamic (rocking) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platform</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro assessments of hCMPs suggest maturation in response to dynamic culture stimulation. In vivo assessments were conducted in a porcine model of myocardial infarction (MI). Animal groups included: MI hearts treated with 2 hCMPs (MI+hCMP, n=13), MI hearts treated with 2 cell-free open fibrin patches (n=14), or MI hearts with neither experimental patch (n=15); a fourth group of animals underwent sham surgery (Sham, n=8). Cardiac function and infarct size were evaluated by MRI, arrhythmia incidence by implanted loop recorders, and the engraftment rate by calculation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of expression of the human Y chromosome. Additional studies examined the myocardial protein expression profile changes and potential mechanisms of action that related to exosomes from the cell patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The hCMPs began to beat synchronously within 1 day of fabrication, and after 7 days of dynamic culture stimulation, in vitro assessments indicated the mechanisms related to the improvements in electronic mechanical coupling, calcium-handling, and force generation, suggesting a maturation process during the dynamic culture. The engraftment rate was 10.9±1.8% at 4 weeks after the transplantation. The hCMP transplantation was associated with significant improvements in left ventricular function, infarct size, myocardial wall stress, myocardial hypertrophy, and reduced apoptosis in the periscar boarder zone myocardium. hCMP transplantation also reversed some MI-associated changes in sarcomeric regulatory protein phosphorylation. The exosomes released from the hCMP appeared to have cytoprotective properties that improved cardiomyocyte survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have fabricated a clinically relevant size of hCMP with trilineage cardiac cells derived from human induced-pluripotent stem cells. The hCMP matures in vitro during 7 days of dynamic culture. Transplantation of this type of hCMP results in significantly reduced infarct size and improvements in cardiac function that are associated with reduction in left ventricular wall stress. The hCMP treatment is not associated with significant changes in arrhythmogenicity.</p></sec>

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p>Proteins fold into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined computational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and stability in uncharted protein space. Iteration between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and experiment increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> into a data-driven science.</p>

De novo design of tunable, pH-driven conformational changes
<p>The ability of naturally occurring proteins to change conformation in response to environmental changes is critical to biological function. Although there have been advances in the de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of stable proteins with a single, deep free-energy minimum, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of conformational switches remains challenging. We present a general strategy to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> pH-responsive protein conformational changes by precisely preorganizing histidine residues in buried hydrogen-bond networks. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> homotrimers and heterodimers that are stable above pH 6.5 but undergo cooperative, large-scale conformational changes when the pH is lowered and electrostatic and steric repulsion builds up as the network histidine residues become protonated. The transition pH and cooperativity can be controlled through the number of histidine-containing networks and the strength of the surrounding hydrophobic interactions. Upon disassembly, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed proteins disrupt lipid membranes both in vitro and after being endocytosed in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that environmentally triggered conformational changes can now be programmed by de novo protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>.</p>

Accurate computational design of multipass transmembrane proteins
<p>The computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of transmembrane proteins with more than one membrane-spanning region remains a major challenge. We report the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of transmembrane monomers, homodimers, trimers, and tetramers with 76 to 215 residue subunits containing two to four membrane-spanning regions and up to 860 total residues that adopt the target oligomerization state in detergent solution. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed proteins localize to the plasma membrane in bacteria and in mammalian cells, and magnetic tweezer unfolding experiments in the membrane indicate that they are very stable. Crystal structures of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed dimer and tetramer—a rocket-shaped structure with a wide cytoplasmic base that funnels into eight transmembrane helices—are very close to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> models.

The diagnostic performance of radiographic criteria to detect aseptic acetabular component loosening after revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of radiographic   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> to detect aseptic acetabular loosening after revision total   hip arthroplasty (THA). Secondary aims were to determine the predictive   values of different thresholds of migration and to determine the   predictive values of radiolucency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Acetabular component migration to re-revision was measured retrospectively   using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup) and manual measurements   (Sutherland method) in two groups: Group A, 52 components (48 patients) found   not loose at re-revision and Group B, 42 components (36 patients)   found loose at re-revision between 1980 and 2015. The presence and   extent of radiolucent lines was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using EBRA, both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were   excellent diagnostic tests for detecting aseptic loosening. The   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was   0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The thresholds of 2.5 mm proximal translation   or 2° sagittal rotation (EBRA) in combination with radiolucency   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88% to detect   aseptic loosening.

Echocardiographic Screening for Rheumatic Heart Disease in High and Low Risk Australian Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Echocardiographic screening for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is becoming more widespread, but screening studies to date have used different echocardiographic definitions. The World Heart Federation has recently published new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> for the echocardiographic diagnosis of RHD. We aimed to establish the prevalence of RHD in high-risk Indigenous Australian children using these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> and to compare the findings with a group of Australian children at low risk for RHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Portable echocardiography was performed on high-risk Indigenous children aged 5 to15 years living in remote communities of northern Australia. A comparison group of low-risk, non-Indigenous children living in urban centers was also screened. Echocardiograms were reported in a standardized, blinded fashion. Of 3946 high-risk children, 34 met World Heart Federation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> for definite RHD (prevalence, 8.6 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 6.0–12.0]) and 66 for borderline RHD (prevalence, 16.7 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 13.0–21.2]). Of 1053 low-risk children, none met the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> for definite RHD, and 5 met the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> for borderline RHD. High-risk children were more likely to have definite or borderline RHD than low-risk children (adjusted odds ratio, 5.7 [95% confidence interval, 2.3–14.1]; <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The prevalence of definite RHD in high-risk Indigenous Australian children approximates what we expected in our population, and no definite RHD was identified in the low-risk group. This study suggests that definite RHD, as defined by the World Heart Federation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong>, is likely to represent true disease. Borderline RHD was identified in children at both low and high risk, highlighting the need for longitudinal studies to evaluate the clinical significance of this finding.</p></sec>

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the structural space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary structures and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local structures not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable structures that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s predicted to fold into single stable structures, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of 9 of 12 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of structures possible for short peptide macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and library selection methods.</p>

“Perfect” designer chromosome V and behavior of a ring derivative
<p>Perfect matching of an assembled physical sequence to a specified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed sequence is crucial to verify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> principles in genome synthesis. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed and de novo synthesized 536,024–base pair chromosome synV in the “Build-A-Genome China” course. We corrected an initial isolate of synV to perfectly match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed sequence using integrative cotransformation and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)–mediated editing in 22 steps; synV strains exhibit high fitness under a variety of culture conditions, compared with that of wild-type V strains. A ring synV derivative was constructed, which is fully functional in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> under all conditions tested and exhibits lower spore viability during meiosis. Ring synV chromosome can extends Sc2.0 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> principles and provides a model with which to study genomic rearrangement, ring chromosome evolution, and human ring chromosome disorders.</p>

Principles for designing proteins with cavities formed by curved β sheets
<p>Active sites and ligand-binding cavities in native proteins are often formed by curved β sheets, and the ability to control β-sheet curvature would allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of binding proteins with cavities customized to specific ligands. Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling β-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of β sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>, de novo, a series of proteins with curved β sheets topped with α helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s closely match the computational models, showing that β-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of proteins with cavities and provides a route to custom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> ligand-binding and catalytic sites.</p>

De novo design of self-assembling helical protein filaments

Cryo–electron microscopy structures of six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s are close to the computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> models. The filament building blocks are idealized repeat proteins, and thus the diameter of the filaments can be systematically tuned by varying the number of repeat units. The assembly and disassembly of the filaments can be controlled by engineered anchor and capping units built from monomers lacking one of the interaction surfaces. The ability to generate dynamic, highly ordered structures that span micrometers from protein monomers opens up possibilities for the fabrication of new multiscale metamaterials.</p>

Enzyme-free nucleic acid dynamical systems

Can simpler molecular mechanisms, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed from scratch, exhibit the same range of behaviors? Abstract chemical reaction networks have been proposed as a programming language for complex dynamics, along with their systematic implementation using short synthetic DNA molecules. We developed this technology for dynamical systems by identifying critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> principles and codifying them into a compiler automating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> process.

Chemogenetics revealed: DREADD occupancy and activation via converted clozapine
<p>The chemogenetic technology DREADD (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er receptors exclusively activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er drugs) is widely used for remote manipulation of neuronal activity in freely moving animals. DREADD technology posits the use of “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er receptors,” which are exclusively activated by the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er drug” clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Nevertheless, the in vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed. CNO does not enter the brain after systemic drug injections and shows low affinity for DREADDs. Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency. Upon systemic CNO injections, converted clozapine readily enters the brain and occupies central nervous system–expressed DREADDs, whereas systemic subthreshold clozapine injections induce preferential DREADD-mediated behaviors.</p>

Electrified methane reforming: A compact approach to greener industrial hydrogen production
<p>Electrification of conventionally fired chemical reactors has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and provide flexible and compact heat generation. Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically heated catalytic structure directly into a steam-methane–reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production. Intimate contact between the electric heat source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases catalyst utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> with small characteristic length scales allows compact reactor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer platforms. Electrification of SMR offers a strong platform for new reactor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>, scale, and implementation opportunities. Implemented on a global scale, this could correspond to a reduction of nearly 1% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

Packing of apolar side chains enables accurate design of highly stable membrane proteins
<p>The features that stabilize the structures of membrane proteins remain poorly understood. Polar interactions contribute modestly, and the hydrophobic effect contributes little to the energetics of apolar side-chain packing in membranes. Disruption of steric packing can destabilize the native folds of membrane proteins, but is packing alone sufficient to drive folding in lipids? If so, then membrane proteins stabilized by this feature should be readily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed and structurally characterized—yet this has not been achieved. Through simulation of the natural protein phospholamban and re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of variants, we define a steric packing code underlying its assembly. Synthetic membrane proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed using this code and stabilized entirely by apolar side chains conform to the intended fold. Although highly stable, the steric complementarity required for their folding is surprisingly stringent. Structural informatics shows that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed packing motif recurs across the proteome, emphasizing a prominent role for precise apolar packing in membrane protein folding, stabilization, and evolution.</p>

A sweeter approach to vaccine design
<p>Vaccines have transformed human health. Yet, guided primarily by empiricism for centuries, vaccine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> ultimately met its match in scourges such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, which continue to plague global health. The elusive search for vaccines against such diseases has driven researchers of diverse expertise to forgo empirical vaccinology. Instead, they favor a reductionist approach inspired by how pathogens interact with the immune system, which has evolved to distinguish foreign from self by sensing both physical (e.g, size) and chemical (e.g., foreign molecules) features of pathogens. This has guided the rational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of vaccines that mimic key pathogen properties, including arraying antigens on particles to increase recognition by antibody-producing B cells (<i>1</i>). However, the mechanisms by which multivalent antigen display on nanoparticles—either synthetic or natural—enhances immunity, and how this may influence vaccine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> principles, remain unresolved. On page 649 of this issue, Tokatlian <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) help fill this knowledge gap by demonstrating that engineering nanoparticles with glycans—sugar molecules—is critical to potentiating antibody responses. This might lead to improved next-generation vaccines against a wide diversity of pathogens.</p>

A designed heme-[4Fe-4S] metalloenzyme catalyzes sulfite reduction like the native enzyme
<p>Multielectron redox reactions often require multicofactor metalloenzymes to facilitate coupled electron and proton movement, but it is challenging to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> artificial enzymes to catalyze these important reactions, owing to their structural and functional complexity. We report a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed heteronuclear heme-[4Fe-4S] cofactor in cytochrome <i>c</i> peroxidase as a structural and functional model of the enzyme sulfite reductase. The initial model exhibits spectroscopic and ligand-binding properties of the native enzyme, and sulfite reduction activity was improved—through rational tuning of the secondary sphere interactions around the [4Fe-4S] and the substrate-binding sites—to be close to that of the native enzyme. By offering insight into the requirements for a demanding six-electron, seven-proton reaction that has so far eluded synthetic catalysts, this study provides strategies for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ing highly functional multicofactor artificial enzymes.</p>

A cargo-sorting DNA robot
<p>Two critical challenges in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and synthesis of molecular robots are modularity and algorithm simplicity. We demonstrate three modular building blocks for a DNA robot that performs cargo sorting at the molecular level. A simple algorithm encoding recognition between cargos and their destinations allows for a simple robot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>: a single-stranded DNA with one leg and two foot domains for walking, and one arm and one hand domain for picking up and dropping off cargos. The robot explores a two-dimensional testing ground on the surface of DNA origami, picks up multiple cargos of two types that are initially at unordered locations, and delivers them to specified destinations until all molecules are sorted into two distinct piles. The robot is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed to perform a random walk without any energy supply. Exploiting this feature, a single robot can repeatedly sort multiple cargos. Localization on DNA origami allows for distinct cargo-sorting tasks to take place simultaneously in one test tube or for multiple robots to collectively perform the same task.</p>

Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) use emergency medical services records, death certificates, or definitions that infer cause of death; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of death are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic deaths among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively identified all incident deaths attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital deaths, all reported by law. We obtained comprehensive records to determine whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths met World Health Organization (WHO) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> for SCD. We reviewed death certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths had no extracardiac cause of death or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 deaths were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and reported to the medical examiner. From these, we identified 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the death certificate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. Leading causes of death were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% (78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs (<i>P</i>=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Forty percent of deaths attributed to stated cardiac arrest were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not arrhythmic. These findings have implications for the accuracy of SCDs as defined by WHO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> or emergency medical services records in aggregate mortality data, clinical trials, and cohort studies.</p></sec>

Arbitrary spin-to–orbital angular momentum conversion of light
<p>Optical elements that convert the spin angular momentum (SAM) of light into vortex beams have found applications in classical and quantum optics. These elements—SAM-to–orbital angular momentum (OAM) converters—are based on the geometric phase and only permit the conversion of left- and right-circular polarizations (spin states) into states with opposite OAM. We present a method for converting arbitrary SAM states into total angular momentum states characterized by a superposition of independent OAM.

Potent peptidic fusion inhibitors of influenza virus

The peptide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> was based on complementarity-determining region loops of human broadly neutralizing antibodies against the hemagglutinin (FI6v3 and CR9114). The optimized peptides exhibit nanomolar affinity and neutralization against influenza A group 1 viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and avian H5N1 strains. The peptide inhibitors bind to the highly conserved stem epitope and block the low pH–induced conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. These peptidic compounds and their advantageous biological properties should accelerate the development of new small molecule– and peptide-based therapeutics against influenza virus.</p>

Zika rewrites maternal immunization ethics
<p>Pregnant women long have been excluded from vaccine studies because researchers are wary of causing unintended harm to the highly vulnerable developing fetus. But a new report from a group that represents many disciplines contends that ethics demand pregnant women be included in the trial of experimental Zika vaccines, which are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed to protect babies from brain damage and other maladies caused by that mosquito-borne virus. The report is careful to point out that risk/benefit ratios must be weighed for each vaccine and each trial on a case-by-case basis—and indeed the Zika vaccine that has moved furthest in human studies rightly excludes pregnant women, says a co-author of the report. Other experimental maternal immunizations <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed to protect babies are also being tested now, and one trial, for a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, includes pregnant women. A vaccine against group B streptococcus has also moved along the development pipeline and may soon enter trials with pregnant women, too. A second new report on maternal immunizations issued last week explores the challenges of doing safety studies in these women and their babies.</p>

The substituents were chosen such that the products from any class of reaction in multiple reaction sets would have unique differences in masses, thus allowing simultaneous identification of the products of all transformations in a set of reactants. In this way, we easily distinguished the products of new reactions from noise and known couplings. Using this method, we discovered an alkyne hydroallylation and a nickel-catalyzed variant of alkyne diarylation.</p>

Synthesis, debugging, and effects of synthetic chromosome consolidation: synVI and beyond
<p>We describe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>, rapid assembly, and characterization of synthetic yeast Sc2.0 chromosome VI (synVI). A mitochondrial defect in the synVI strain mapped to synonymous coding changes within <i>PRE4</i> (<i>YFR050C</i>), encoding an essential proteasome subunit; Sc2.0 coding changes reduced Pre4 protein accumulation by half. Completing Sc2.0 specifies consolidation of 16 synthetic chromosomes into a single strain. We investigated phenotypic, transcriptional, and proteomewide consequences of Sc2.0 chromosome consolidation in poly-synthetic strains. Another “bug” was discovered through proteomic analysis, associated with alteration of the <i>HIS2</i> transcription start due to transfer RNA deletion and loxPsym site insertion. Despite extensive genetic alterations across 6% of the genome, no major global changes were detected in the poly-synthetic strain “omics” analyses. This work sets the stage for completion of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er, synthetic eukaryotic genome.</p>

Bug mapping and fitness testing of chemically synthesized chromosome X

SynX exhibited good fitness under a wide variety of conditions. A highly efficient mapping strategy called pooled PCRTag mapping (PoPM), which can be generalized to any watermarked synthetic chromosome, was developed to identify genetic alterations that affect cell fitness (“bugs”). A series of bugs were corrected that included a large region bearing complex amplifications, a growth defect mapping to a recoded sequence in <i>FIP1</i>, and a loxPsym site affecting promoter function of <i>ATP2</i>. PoPM is a powerful tool for synthetic yeast genome debugging and an efficient strategy for phenotype-genotype mapping.</p>

3D organization of synthetic and scrambled chromosomes
<p>Although the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of the synthetic yeast genome Sc2.0 is highly conservative with respect to gene content, the deletion of several classes of repeated sequences and the introduction of thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er changes may affect genome organization and potentially alter cellular functions. We report here the Hi-C–determined three-dimensional (3D) conformations of Sc2.0 chromosomes. The absence of repeats leads to a smoother contact pattern and more precisely tractable chromosome conformations, and the large-scale genomic organization is globally unaffected by the presence of synthetic chromosome(s). Two exceptions are synIII, which lacks the silent mating-type cassettes, and synXII, specifically when the ribosomal DNA is moved to another chromosome. We also exploit the contact maps to detect rearrangements induced in SCRaMbLE (synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by <i>loxP</i>-mediated evolution) strains.</p>

Bone-like crack resistance in hierarchical metastable nanolaminate steels
<p>Fatigue failures create enormous risks for all engineered structures, as well as for human lives, motivating large safety factors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and, thus, inefficient use of resources. Inspired by the excellent fracture toughness of bone, we explored the fatigue resistance in metastability-assisted multiphase steels. We show here that when steel microstructures are hierarchical and laminated, similar to the substructure of bone, superior crack resistance can be realized. Our results reveal that tuning the interface structure, distribution, and phase stability to simultaneously activate multiple micromechanisms that resist crack propagation is key for the observed leap in mechanical response. The exceptional properties enabled by this strategy provide guidance for all fatigue-resistant alloy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> efforts.</p>

A chemical biology route to site-specific authentic protein modifications
<p>Many essential biological processes are controlled by posttranslational protein modifications. The inability to synthetically attain the diversity enabled by these modifications limits functional studies of many proteins. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed a three-step approach for installing authentic posttranslational modifications in recombinant proteins. We first use the established <i>O</i>-phosphoserine (Sep) orthogonal translation system to create a Sep-containing recombinant protein. The Sep residue is then dephosphorylated to dehydroalanine (Dha). Last, conjugate addition of alkyl iodides to Dha, promoted by zinc and copper, enables chemoselective carbon-carbon bond formation. To validate our approach, we produced histone H3, ubiquitin, and green fluorescent protein variants with site-specific modifications, including different methylations of H3K79. The methylated histones stimulate transcription through histone acetylation. This approach offers a powerful tool to engineer diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er proteins.</p>

However, obtaining transgenic plants with maximal gene silencing remains a major technical challenge in current amiRNA applications. Here, we incorporated an empirically determined feature of effective amiRNAs to the amiRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and in silico generated a database containing 533,429 gene-specific amiRNAs for silencing 27,136 genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with a genome coverage of 98.87%. In both single-gene and multiple-gene silencing, we observed an overall improvement in performance by amiRNAs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed using our strategy in Arabidopsis protoplasts and transgenic plants. In addition, the endogenous tRNA-processing system was used to generate multiple amiRNAs from tRNA-pre-amiRNA tandem repeats for multiplex gene silencing. An intronic amiRNA-producing fluorescent reporter was explored as a visual screening strategy for transgenic Arabidopsis and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) plants with maximal whole-plant or cell type-specific gene silencing. These improvements enable the amiRNA technology to be a functional gene knockout tool for basic and applied plant research.</p>

Modeling of Dolichol Mass Spectra Isotopic Envelopes as a Tool to Monitor Isoprenoid Biosynthesis
<p>The cooperation of the mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways, operating in parallel in plants to generate isoprenoid precursors, has been studied extensively. Elucidation of the isoprenoid metabolic pathways is indispensable for the rational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of plant and microbial systems for the production of industrially valuable terpenoids. Here, we describe a new method, based on numerical modeling of mass spectra of metabolically labeled dolichols (Dols), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed to quantitatively follow the cooperation of MVA and MEP reprogrammed upon osmotic stress (sorbitol treatment) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The contribution of the MEP pathway increased significantly (reaching 100%) exclusively for the dominating Dols, while for long-chain Dols, the relative input of the MEP and MVA pathways remained unchanged, suggesting divergent sites of synthesis for dominating and long-chain Dols. The analysis of numerically modeled Dol mass spectra is a novel method to follow modulation of the concomitant activity of isoprenoid-generating pathways in plant cells; additionally, it suggests an exchange of isoprenoid intermediates between plastids and peroxisomes.</p>

The direct anterior approach in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The most effective surgical approach for total hip arthroplasty   (THA) remains controversial.

Five-year clinical and radiological outcomes in 257 consecutive cementless Oxford medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasties
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to examine the clinical and radiographic outcomes   in 257 consecutive Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (OUKAs)   (238 patients), five years post-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective evaluation was undertaken of patients treated   between April 2008 and October 2010 in a regional centre by two   non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ing surgeons with no previous experience of UKAs. The   Oxford Knee Scores (OKSs) were recorded and fluoroscopically aligned   radiographs were assessed post-operatively at one and five years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median age of the 238 patients was 65.0 years (interquartile   range (IQR) 59.0 to 73.0), the median body mas index was 30.0 (IQR   27.5 to 33.0) and 51.7% were male. There were no intra-operative   complications. There was a significant improvement in the median   OKS at six weeks (34, IQR 31.0 to 37.0), one year (38, IQR 29.0   to 43.0) and five years (37, IQR 27.0 to 42.0) when compared with   the pre-operative scores (16, IQR 13.0 to 19.0) (all p = < 0.01).   No patient had progressive radiolucent lines or loosening.</p><p>A total of 16 patients had died by five years.

Periprosthetic femoral fractures and trying to avoid them
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Periprosthetic femoral fractures (PFF) following total hip arthroplasty   (THA) are devastating complications that are associated with functional   limitations and increased overall mortality. Although cementless   implants have been associated with an increased risk of PFF, the   precise contribution of implant geometry and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> on the risk   of both intra-operative and post-operative PFF remains poorly investigated.   A systematic review was performed to aggregate all of the PFF literature   with specific attention to the femoral implant used.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A systematic search strategy of several journal databases and   recent proceedings from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons   was performed. Clinical articles were included for analysis if sufficient   implant description was provided. All articles were reviewed by   two reviewers. A review of fundamental investigations of implant   load-to-failure was performed, with the intent of identifying similar   conclusions from the clinical and fundamental literature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total 596 articles were initially identified, with 34 being   eligible for analysis. Aggregate analysis of 1691 PFFs in 342 719   primary THAs revealed a significantly higher number of PFFs with   cementless femoral implants (p < 0.001). Single-wedge and double-wedge   (fit-and-fill) femoral implants were associated with a threefold   increase in PFF rates (p < 0.001) compared with anatomical, fully   coated and tapered/rounded stems. Within cemented stems, loaded-taper   (Exeter) stems were associated with more PFFs than composite-beam   (Charnley) stems (p = 0.004). Review of the fundamental literature   revealed very few studies comparing cementless component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Very few studies within the PFF literature provide detailed implant   information. Cementless implants, specifically those of single-wedge   and double-wedge, have the highest PFF rates in the literature,   with most investigations recommending against their use in older   patients with osteoporotic bone. This review illustrates the need   for registries and future PFF studies to record implant name and   information for future analysis. Furthermore, future biomechanical   investigations comparing modern implants are needed to clarify the   precise contribution of implant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> to PFF risk.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):50–9.</p></sec>

Dislocation following total hip arthroplasty using dual mobility acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this systematic review was to report the rate of dislocation   following the use of dual mobility (DM) acetabular components in   primary and revision total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review of the literature according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines   was performed. A comprehensive search of Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane   Library and Embase (Scopus) was conducted for English articles between   January 1974 and March 2016 using various combinations of the keywords “dual   mobility”, “dual-mobility”, “tripolar”, “double-mobility”, “double   mobility”, “hip”, “cup”, “socket”. The following data were extracted   by two investigators independently: demographics, whether the operation   was a primary or revision THA, length of follow-up, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of   the components, diameter of the femoral head, and type of fixation   of the acetabular component.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 59 articles met our inclusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong>. These included   a total of 17 908 THAs which were divided into two groups: studies   dealing with DM components in primary THA and those dealing with   these components in revision THA. The mean rate of dislocation was   0.9% in the primary THA group, and 3.0% in the revision THA group.   The mean rate of intraprosthetic dislocation was 0.7% in primary   and 1.3% in revision THAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the current data, the use of DM acetabular components   are effective in minimising the risk of instability after both primary   and revision THA. This benefit must be balanced against continuing   concerns about the additional modularity, and the new mode of failure   of intraprosthetic dislocation. Longer term studies are needed to   assess the function of these newer materials compared with previous   generations. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1   Supple A):18–24.</p></sec>

Qualitative α-defensin test (Synovasure) for the diagnosis of periprosthetic infection in revision total joint arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains   demanding due to limitations of all the available diagnostic tests.   The synovial fluid marker, α-defensin, is a promising adjunct for   the assessment of potential PJI. The purpose of this study was to   investigate the qualitative assessment of α-defensin, using Synovasure   to detect or exclude periprosthetic infection in total joint arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We studied 50 patients (28 women, 22 men, mean age 65 years;   20 to 89) with a clinical indication for revision arthroplasty who   met the inclusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> of this prospective diagnostic study.   The presence of α-defensin was determined using the qualitative   Synovasure test and compared with standard diagnostic methods for   PJI. Based on modified Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS)   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong>, 13 cases were categorised as septic and 36 as aseptic revisions.

Unconstrained metacarpophalangeal joint arthroplasties
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We performed a systematic review of the current literature regarding   the outcomes of unconstrained metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We initially identified 1305 studies, and 406 were found to be   duplicates.

Outcomes extracted included pre- and post-operative   pain visual analogue scores, range of movement (ROM), strength of   pinch and grip, satisfaction and patient reported outcome measures   (PROMs). Clinical and radiological complications were recorded.   The results are presented in three groups based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of   the arthroplasty and the aetiology (pyrocarbon-osteoarthritis (pyro-OA),   pyrocarbon-inflammatory arthritis (pyro-IA), metal-on-polyethylene   (MoP)).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Results show that pyrocarbon implants provide an 85% reduction   in pain, 144% increase of pinch grip and 13° improvements in ROM   for both OA and IA combined. Patients receiving MoP arthroplasties   had a reduction in pinch strength. Satisfaction rates were 91% and   92% for pyrocarbon-OA and pyrocarbon-IA groups, respectively. There were   nine failures in 87 joints (10.3%) over a mean follow-up of 5.5   years (1.0 to 14.3) for pyro-OA. There were 18 failures in 149 joints   (12.1%) over a mean period of 6.6 years (1.0 to 16.0) for pyro-IA.

Do varus or valgus outliers have higher forces in the medial or lateral compartments than those which are in-range after a kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of patients   with outlier varus or valgus alignment in kinematically aligned   total knee arthroplasty (TKA), whether those with outlier varus   or valgus alignment have higher forces in the medial or lateral   compartments of the knee than those with in-range alignment and   whether measurements of the alignment of the limb, knee and components   predict compartment forces.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The intra-operative forces in the medial and lateral compartments   were measured with an instrumented tibial insert in 67 patients   who underwent a kinematically aligned TKA during passive movement.   The mean of the forces at full extension, 45° and 90° of flexion   determined the force in the medial and lateral compartments. Measurements   of the alignment of the limb and the components included the hip-knee-ankle   (HKA) angle, proximal medial tibial angle (PMTA), and distal lateral   femoral angle (DLFA). Measurements of the alignment of the knee   and the components included the tibiofemoral angle (TFA), tibial   component angle (TCA) and femoral component angle (FCA).

Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow test kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow test kit for the diagnosis of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> were all clinical studies where the diagnosis   of PJI was uncertain. All studies selected used the Musculoskeletal   Infection Society (MSIS) or modified MSIS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong>. Two independent   reviewers reviewed the studies and extracted data. A meta-analysis   of results was carried out: pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive   and negative likelihood ratio, heterogeneity and areas under curves   are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ten studies (759 patients) were included. Of these, seven studies   (640 patients) evaluated the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay   and three (119 patients) the lateral flow test. The pooled sensitivity   and specificity of the qualitative α-defensin laboratory immunoassay   was 0.953 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.984) and 0.965 (95%   CI 0.943 to 0.979) respectively. The pooled positive likelihood   ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were 34.86 (95%   CI 19.34 to 62.85) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.11). The pooled sensitivity   and specificity of the lateral flow test were 0.774 (95% CI 0.637   to 0.870) and 0.913 (95% CI 0.828 to 0.958), respectively. The pooled   PLR and NLR were 8.675 (95% CI 4.229 to 17.794) and 0.248 (95% CI   0.147 to 0.418), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the lateral flow test   were lower than those of the   α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay test. Hence, care must be   taken with interpretation of the lateral flow test when relying   on its results for the intra-operative diagnosis of PJI.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:66–72.</p></sec>

How Do Resuscitation Teams at Top-Performing Hospitals for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Succeed?
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is common, and outcomes vary substantially across US hospitals, but reasons for these differences are largely unknown. We set out to better understand how top-performing hospitals organize their resuscitation teams to achieve high survival rates for IHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We calculated risk-standardized IHCA survival to discharge rates across American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation registry hospitals between 2012 and 2014. We identified geographically and academically diverse hospitals in the top, middle, and bottom quartiles of survival for IHCA and performed a qualitative study that included site visits with in-depth interviews of clinical and administrative staff at 9 hospitals. With the use of thematic analysis, data were analyzed to identify salient themes of perceived performance by informants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Across 9 hospitals, we interviewed 158 individuals from multiple disciplines including physicians (17.1%), nurses (45.6%), other clinical staff (17.1%), and administration (20.3%). We identified 4 broad themes related to resuscitation teams: (1) team <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>, (2) team composition and roles, (3) communication and leadership during IHCA, and (4) training and education. Resuscitation teams at top-performing hospitals demonstrated the following features: dedicated or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ated resuscitation teams; participation of diverse disciplines as team members during IHCA; clear roles and responsibilities of team members; better communication and leadership during IHCA; and in-depth mock codes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Resuscitation teams at hospitals with high IHCA survival differ from non–top-performing hospitals. Our findings suggest core elements of successful resuscitation teams that are associated with better outcomes and form the basis for future work to improve IHCA.</p></sec>

Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response as well as in supporting the generation of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues play an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response of plants to light stress.</p>

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density versus cells with high t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after mechanical unloading.</p></sec>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one sex or species with the leg coloration of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion template for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

Proteomic analysis of S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in rat cortical neurons
<p>Neurons modulate gene expression in response to extrinsic signals to enable brain development, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion, and learning and to process stimuli that regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic physiological functions. This signal-to-gene communication is facilitated by posttranslational modifications such as S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) moiety to cysteine thiols. In the cerebral cortex, S-nitrosylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is required for gene transcription during neuronal development, but few other nuclear targets of S-nitrosylation have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed to date. We used S-nitrosothiol resin-assisted capture on NO donor-treated nuclear extracts from rat cortical neurons and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 614 S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins. Of these, 131 proteins have not previously been shown to be S-nitrosylated in any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, and 555 are previously un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed targets of S-nitrosylation in neurons. The sites of S-nitrosylation were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed for 59% of the targets, and motifs containing single lysines were found at 33% of these sites. In addition, lysine motifs were necessary for promoting the S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 and methyl-CpG binding protein 3 (MBD3). Moreover, S-nitrosylation of the histone-binding protein RBBP7 was necessary for dendritogenesis of cortical neurons in culture. Together, our findings characterize S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in neurons and identify S-nitrosylation motifs that may be shared with other targets of NO signaling.</p>

Systematic discovery of antiphage defense systems in the microbial pangenome
<p>The arms race between bacteria and phages led to the development of sophisticated antiphage defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, including CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Evidence suggests that known and unknown defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s are located in “defense islands” in microbial genomes. Here, we comprehensively characterized the bacterial defensive arsenal by examining gene families that are clustered next to known defense genes in prokaryotic genomes. Candidate defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>atically engineered and validated in model bacteria for their antiphage activities. We report nine previously unknown antiphage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s and one antiplasmid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> that are widespread in microbes and strongly protect against foreign invaders. These include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s that adopted components of the bacterial flagella and condensin complexes. Our data also suggest a common, ancient ancestry of innate immunity components shared between animals, plants, and bacteria.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants
<p>Non-cell autonomous RNA silencing can spread from cell to cell and over long distances in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile gene silencing are poorly understood. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a <i>DICER-LIKE2</i> (<i>DCL2</i>)<i>-</i>dependent mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic spread of posttranscriptional RNA silencing, also known as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Using a suite of transgenic <i>DCL</i> RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that <i>N. benthamiana</i> DCL1, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22, 24, and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of <i>DCL2</i> expression reduced the spread of gene silencing, while suppression of <i>DCL3</i> or <i>DCL4</i> expression enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. In contrast to <i>DCL4</i> RNAi lines, <i>DCL2</i>-<i>DCL4</i> double-RNAi lines developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS similar to that observed in <i>DCL2</i> RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that <i>DCL2</i> was required in the scion to respond to the signal, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated <i>DCL</i> genetic pathway in which <i>DCL2</i> plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, while both <i>DCL4</i> and <i>DCL3</i> attenuate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. We discuss the potential role of 21, 22, and 24 nt siRNAs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

A Genetic Screen for Impaired Systemic RNAi Highlights the Crucial Role of DICER-LIKE 2
<p>Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of transgenes involves abundant 21-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and low-abundance 22-nucleotide siRNAs produced from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by DCL4 and DCL2, respectively. However, DCL2 facilitates the recruitment of RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) to ARGONAUTE 1-derived cleavage products, resulting in more efficient amplification of secondary and transitive dsRNA and siRNAs. Here, we describe a reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> where RDR6-dependent PTGS is initiated by restricted expression of an inverted-repeat dsRNA specifically in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root tip, allowing a genetic screen to identify mutants impaired in RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Our screen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed <i>dcl2</i> but not <i>dcl4</i> mutants. Moreover, grafting experiments showed that DCL2, but not DCL4, is required in both the source rootstock and the recipient shoot tissue for efficient RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Furthermore, <i>dcl4</i> rootstocks produced more DCL2-dependent 22-nucleotide siRNAs than the wild type and showed enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic movement of PTGS to grafted shoots. Thus, along with its role in recruiting RDR6 for further amplification of PTGS, DCL2 is crucial for RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, predominantly the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Genetic and Functional Profiling of CD16-Dependent Natural Killer Activation Identifies Patients at Higher Risk of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an effective therapy for end-stage heart failure. Because cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of late mortality after heart transplant (HT), there is a need to identify markers that reflect inflammatory or cytotoxic immune mechanisms contributing to its onset. Noninvasive and early stratification of patients at risk remains a challenge for adapting individualized therapy. The CD16 (Fc-gamma receptor 3A [FCGR3A]) receptor was recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a major determinant of antibody-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation in HT biopsies; however, little is known about the role of CD16 in promoting allograft vasculopathy. This study aimed to investigate whether markers that reflect CD16-dependent circulating NK cell activation may identify patients at higher risk of developing CAV after HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Blood samples were collected from 103 patients undergoing routine coronarography angiography for CAV diagnosis (median 5 years since HT). Genomic and phenotypic analyses of FCGR3A/CD16 Fc-receptor profiles were compared in CAV-positive (n=52) and CAV-free patients (n=51). The levels of CD16 expression and rituximab-dependent cell cytotoxic activity of peripheral NK cells in HT recipients were evaluated using a noninvasive NK-cellular humoral activation test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enhanced levels of CD16 expression and antibody-dependent NK cell cytotoxic function of HT recipients were associated with the FCGR3A-VV genotype. The frequency of the FCGR3A-VV genotype was significantly higher in the CAV<sup>+</sup> group (odds ratio, 3.9; <i>P</i>=0.0317) than in the CAV<sup>-</sup> group. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as an independent marker correlated with the presence of CAV at the time of coronary angiography by using multivariate logistic regression models. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a baseline-independent predictor of CAV risk (odds ratio, 4.7; <i>P</i>=0.023).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study unravels a prominent role for the CD16-dependent NK cell activation pathway in the complex array of factors that favor the progression of transplant arteriosclerosis. It highlights the clinical potential of a noninvasive evaluation of FCGR3A/CD16 in the early stratification of CAV risk. The re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion of CD16 as a major checkpoint that controls immune surveillance may promote the design of individualized NK cell–targeted therapies to limit vascular damage in highly responsive sensitized patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

We used linear regression to determine change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ive performance during 2 consecutive examination rounds in relation to perfusion. Finally, we investigated whether associations were modified by baseline severity of white matter hyperintensities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 4759 participants (median age 61.3 years, 55.2% women) with a median follow-up of 6.9 years, 123 participants developed dementia (97 Alzheimer disease).

Broad location categories may be composed of many businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating operating hours and time of OHCA occurrence may improve automated external defibrillator accessibility.

In particular, transitions between disorder and either polar- or nematically ordered phases have been predicted and observed in two-dimensional active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, coexistence between phases of different types of order has not been reported. We demonstrate the emergence of dynamic coexistence of ordered states with fluctuating nematic and polar symmetry in an actomyosin motility assay. Combining experiments with agent-based simulations, we identify sufficiently weak interactions that lack a clear alignment symmetry as a prerequisite for coexistence. Thus, the symmetry of macroscopic order becomes an emergent and dynamic property of the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. These results provide a pathway by which living <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can express different types of order by using identical building blocks.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. We suggest that sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of diagnosis were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in <i>BMPR2</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations.

MicroRNA-Based Therapy of GATA2-Deficient Vascular Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The transcription factor GATA2 orchestrates the expression of many endothelial-specific genes, illustrating its crucial importance for endothelial cell function. The capacity of this transcription factor in orchestrating endothelial-important microRNAs (miRNAs/miR) is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial GATA2 was functionally analyzed in human endothelial cells in vitro.

Next, the GATA2-dependent miR transcriptome was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by using a profiling approach on the basis of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Transcriptional control of miR promoters was assessed via chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase promoter assays, and bisulfite sequencing analysis of sites in proximity.

Specifically, proangiogenic miR-126 was regulated by GATA2 transcriptionally and targeted antiangiogenic SPRED1 and FOXO3a contributing to GATA2-mediated formation of normal vascular structures, whereas GATA2 deficiency led to vascular abnormalities. In contrast to GATA2 deficiency, supplementation with miR-126 normalized vascular function and expression profiles of cytokines contributing to proangiogenic paracrine effects. GATA2 silencing resulted in endothelial DNA hypomethylation leading to induced expression of antiangiogenic miR-221 by GATA2-dependent demethylation of a putative CpG island in the miR-221 promoter. Mechanistically, a reverted GATA2 phenotype by endogenous suppression of miR-221 was mediated through direct proangiogenic miR-221 target genes ICAM1 and ETS1. In a mouse model of carotid injury, GATA2 was reduced, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic supplementation of miR-126–coupled nanoparticles enhanced miR-126 availability in the carotid artery and improved reendothelialization of injured carotid arteries in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>GATA2-mediated regulation of miR-126 and miR-221 has an important impact on endothelial biology.

Distinct control of PERIOD2 degradation and circadian rhythms by the oncoprotein and ubiquitin ligase MDM2
<p>The circadian clock relies on posttranslational modifications to set the timing for degradation of core regulatory components, which drives clock progression. Ubiquitin-modifying enzymes that target clock components for degradation mainly recognize phosphorylated substrates. Degradation of the circadian clock component PERIOD 2 (PER2) is mediated by its phospho-specific re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion by β-transducin repeat–containing proteins (β-TrCPs), which are F-box–containing proteins that function as substrate re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion subunits of the SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex. However, this mode of regulating PER2 stability falls short of explaining the persistent oscillatory phenotypes reported in biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s lacking functional elements of the phospho-dependent PER2 degradation machinery. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed PER2 as a previously uncharacterized substrate for the ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and found that MDM2 targeted PER2 for degradation in a manner independent of PER2 phosphorylation. Deregulation of MDM2 plays a major role in oncogenesis by contributing to the accumulation of genomic and epigenomic alterations that favor tumor development. MDM2-mediated PER2 turnover was important for defining the circadian period length in mammalian cells, a finding that emphasizes the connection between the circadian clock and cancer. Our results not only broaden the range of specific substrates of MDM2 beyond the cell cycle to include circadian components but also identify a previously unknown regulator of the clock as a druggable node that is often found to be deregulated during tumorigenesis.</p>

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in cancer genomics is identifying “driver” mutations from the many neutral “passenger” mutations within a given tumor. To identify driver mutations that would otherwise be lost within mutational noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation mutations occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 tumor-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed on the basis of amino acid conservation and mutational frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF mutations were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-cancer analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, despite its mutational frequency falling within the mutational noise for this cancer type. The majority of mutations in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric cancer cells harboring LOF mutations in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric cancer. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional cancer driver mutations and define the JNK pathway as tumor-suppressive in gastric cancer.</p>

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s carrying out complex computations were biological nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to brain circuits as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent computation by brain-like circuits (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical circuitry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep network” (or deep net) architecture, this brain-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central areas of AI research, including computer vision, speech re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as computer vision and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of brain circuitry could supply cues for guiding network models toward broader aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion and general AI.</p>

Connecting neuronal circuits for movement
<p>Movement is the most common final output of nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> activity and is essential for survival. But what makes this seemingly trivial statement so scientifically challenging? Neurons that contribute to when and how our body moves are distributed throughout the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Thus, even a simple movement such as arm flexion requires the coordinated activation of many different neuronal populations across multiple brain regions. A key question is how the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> produces diverse and precise actions aligned with the organisms' behavioral needs. These processes are affected in diseases such as Parkinson's or Huntington's, in which aberrant motor behavior dominates. Recent studies are transformative in how we think about the control of movement. A common denominator of these studies is that brain regions that contribute to motor behavior can no longer be considered as interacting boxes. Instead, deep circuit-level insight based on specific neuronal populations emerges as being critical to revealing motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> organization and understanding its function. It is likely that insights at this level can also help to design more specific and direct interventions for diseases of the motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and neuroprosthetics applied after injuries.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems

We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to biological and synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.

Recurrences in an isolated quantum many-body system

Single-cell methylomes identify neuronal subtypes and regulatory elements in mammalian cortex

We generated >6000 methylomes from single neuronal nuclei and used them to identify 16 mouse and 21 human neuronal subpopulations in the frontal cortex. CG and non-CG methylation exhibited cell type–specific distributions, and we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed regulatory elements with differential methylation across neuron types. Methylation signatures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a layer 6 excitatory neuron subtype and a unique human parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neuron subtype. We observed stronger cross-species conservation of regulatory elements in inhibitory neurons than in excitatory neurons.

Two areas for familiar face recognition in the primate brain
<p>Familiarity alters face re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion: Familiar faces are recognized more accurately than unfamiliar ones and under difficult viewing conditions when unfamiliar face re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion fails. The neural basis for this fundamental difference remains unknown. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that personally familiar faces engage the macaque face-processing network more than unfamiliar faces. Familiar faces also recruited two hitherto unknown face areas at anatomically conserved locations within the perirhinal cortex and the temporal pole. These two areas, but not the core face-processing network, responded to familiar faces emerging from a blur with a characteristic nonlinear surge, akin to the abruptness of familiar face re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion. In contrast, responses to unfamiliar faces and objects remained linear. Thus, two temporal lobe areas extend the core face-processing network into a familiar face-re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

An Efficient System for <i>Ds</i> Transposon Tagging in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Transposon tagging is a powerful tool that has been widely applied in several species for insertional mutagenesis in plants. Several efforts have aimed to create transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutant populations in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot plant used as a model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to study temperate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at using transposon strategies. Here, we describe the application of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociation</i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> element were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> plants. The <i>Ds</i> element was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the function of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, and segregation, the <i>Ds</i> element separated from the <i>Ac</i> element. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only plants using G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> lines, some of which were highly efficient at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only plants. Furthermore, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a large collection of mutants with visible developmental phenotypes via this transposon tagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is relatively simple and rapid in comparison to traditional T-DNA insertion strategies, because once efficiency lines are obtained they can be reused to generate more lines from nontransposed plants without the use of time-consuming tissue culture steps.</p>

Identification of Genes Related to Cold Tolerance and a Functional Allele That Confers Cold Tolerance
<p>Cold stress is a major factor limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide, especially at the seedling and booting stages. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation of genes associated with cold tolerance (CT) in rice is important for sustainable food production. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide association study to identify the genetic loci associated with CT by using a 1,033-accession diversity panel. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed five CT-related genetic loci at the booting stage. Accessions carrying multiple cold-tolerant alleles displayed a higher seed-setting rate than did accessions that had no cold-tolerant alleles or carried a single allele. At the seedling stage, eight genetic loci related to CT have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed. Among these, <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as the candidate gene for the <i>qPSR10</i> genetic locus that is associated with CT in rice seedlings. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SNP2<sup>G</sup>, at position 343 in <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> is responsible for conferring CT at the seedling stage in rice. Further analysis of the haplotype network revealed that SNP2<sup>G</sup> was present in 80.08% of the temperate <i>japonica</i> accessions but only 3.8% of the <i>indica</i> ones. We used marker-assisted selection to construct a series of BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>3</sub> near-isogenic lines possessing the cold-tolerant allele SNP2<sup>G</sup>. When subjected to cold stress, plants carrying SNP2<sup>G</sup> survived better as seedlings and showed higher grain weight than plants carrying the SNP2<sup>A</sup> allele. The CT-related loci <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed here and the functional verification of <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> will provide genetic resources for breeding cold-tolerant varieties and for studying the molecular basis of CT in rice.</p>

A New Phenotyping Pipeline Reveals Three Types of Lateral Roots and a Random Branching Pattern in Two Cereals
<p>Recent progress in root phenotyping has focused mainly on increasing throughput for genetic studies, while identifying root developmental patterns has been comparatively underexplored. We introduce a new phenotyping pipeline for producing high-quality spatiotemporal root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> development data and identifying developmental patterns within these data. The SmartRoot image-analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and temporal and spatial statistical models were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Semi-Markov switching linear models were used to cluster lateral roots based on their growth rate profiles. These models revealed three types of lateral roots with similar characteristics in both species. The first type corresponds to fast and accelerating roots, the second to rapidly arrested roots, and the third to an intermediate type where roots cease elongation after a few days. These types of lateral roots were retrieved in different proportions in a maize mutant affected in auxin signaling, while the first most vigorous type was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover, the classification of growth rate profiles was mirrored by a ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential dependencies in the succession of lateral root types along the primary root were then analyzed using variable-order Markov chains. The lateral root type was not influenced by the shootward neighbor root type or by the distance from this root. This random branching pattern of primary roots was remarkably conserved, despite the high variability of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in both species. Our phenotyping pipeline opens the door to exploring the genetic variability of lateral root developmental patterns.</p>

Selective Targeting of Mobile mRNAs to Plasmodesmata for Cell-to-Cell Movement
<p>Many plant mRNAs move from cell to cell or long distance to execute non-cell-autonomous functions. These mobile mRNAs traffic through the phloem to regulate many developmental processes, but despite the burgeoning discovery of mobile mRNAs, little is known about the mechanism underlying the intracellular sorting of these mRNAs. Here, we exploited a fluorescence-based mRNA labeling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, using the bacteriophage coat protein MS2, fused to GFP (MS2-GFP) and an MS2 re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion site in the RNA of interest, to visualize the intracellular trafficking of mobile mRNAs in living plant cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We first improved this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> by using the nuclear localization sequence from FD, which substantially reduced the fluorescent background of MS2-GFP in the cytoplasm. The modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> allowed us to observe the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci dependent on MS2-binding sites. Coexpressing the MS2-GFP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with a virus movement protein, which is a plasmodesmata (PD)-localized nonspecific RNA-binding protein, targeted cytoplasmic fluorescent foci to the PD, suggesting that the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci contain mRNA and MS2-GFP. Our ex vivo RNA imaging revealed that mobile but not nonmobile mRNAs were selectively targeted to PD. Real-time images of intracellular translocation revealed that the translocation of mRNA and organelles in the transvacuolar strands may be governed by the same mechanism. Our study suggests that PD targeting of mRNA is a selective step in determining mRNA cell-to-cell movement of mRNAs.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical biology. Small molecules are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in screens designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

A Viral Satellite DNA Vector (TYLCCNV) for Functional Analysis of miRNAs and siRNAs in Plants
<p>With experimental and bioinformatical methods, numerous small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), have been found in plants, and they play vital roles in various biological regulation processes. However, most of these small RNAs remain to be functionally characterized. Until now, only several viral vectors were developed to overexpress miRNAs with limited application in plants. In this study, we report a new small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> via viral satellite DNA associated with <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</i> (TYLCCNV) vector, which could highly overexpress not only artificial and endogenous miRNAs but also endogenous siRNAs in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. First, we constructed basic TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(319L) vector with widely used <i>AtMIR319a</i> backbone, but the expected photobleaching phenotype was very weak. Second, through comparing the effect of backbones (<i>AtMIR319a</i>, <i>AtMIR390a</i>, and <i>SlMIR159</i>) on specificity and significance of generating small RNAs, the <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone was optimally selected to construct the small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Third, through sRNA-Seq and Degradome-Seq, the small RNAs from <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone in TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(390) vector were confirmed to highly overexpress amiRPDS and specifically silence targeted <i>PDS</i> gene. Using this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, rapid functional analysis of endogenous miRNAs and siRNAs was carried out, including miR156 and <i>athTAS3a</i> 5′D8(+). Meanwhile, through designing corresponding artificial miRNAs, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> could also significantly silence targeted endogenous genes and show specific phenotypes, including <i>PDS</i>, <i>Su</i>, and <i>PCNA</i>. These results demonstrated that this small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> could contribute to investigating not only the function of endogenous small RNAs, but also the functional genes in plants.</p>

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A deeper understanding of the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is crucial in tailoring digestibility without sacrificing grain quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched starch structure from grains of a 320 <i>indica</i> rice diversity panel using genotyping data from the high-density rice array. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s genetics approach that interrelates starch structure data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound Starch Synthase I</i> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch structure with starch digestibility by determining the kinetics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch structure with estimated digestibility kinetics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s genetics, and digestibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch structure in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the digestibility of rice grain, thus offering rice consumers a new diet-based intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Source of CpG Depletion in the HIV-1 Genome
<p>The dinucleotide CpG is highly underrepresented in the genome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). To identify the source of CpG depletion in the HIV-1 genome, we investigated two biological mechanisms: (1) CpG methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and (2) CpG re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We hypothesized that HIV-1 has been under selective evolutionary pressure by these mechanisms leading to the reduction of CpG in its genome. A CpG depleted genome would enable HIV-1 to avoid methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and/or to avoid re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion by TLRs that identify foreign CpG sequences. We investigated these two hypotheses by determining the sequence context dependency of CpG depletion and comparing it with that of CpG methylation and TLR re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cognit</span></strong>ion. We found that in both human and HIV-1 genomes the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were depleted most and those flanked by C/G were depleted least. Similarly, our analyses of human methylome data revealed that the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were methylated most and those flanked by C/G were methylated least. Given that a similar CpG depletion pattern was observed for the human genome within which CpGs are not likely to be recognized by TLRs, we argue that the main source of CpG depletion in HIV-1 is likely host-induced methylation. Analyses of CpG motifs in over 100 viruses revealed that this unique CpG representation pattern is specific to the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses.</p>

WT1 regulates the development of the posterior taste field
<p>Despite the importance of taste in determining nutrient intake, our understanding of the processes that control the development of the peripheral taste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is lacking. Several early regulators of taste development have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed, including sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 4 and multiple members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulation of these factors, including their induction, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial role for the Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) in circumvallate (CV) papillae development. WT1 is a transcription factor that is important in the normal development of multiple tissues, including both the olfactory and visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. In mice, WT1 expression is detectable by E12.5, when the CV taste placode begins to form. In mice lacking WT1, the CV fails to develop normally and markers of early taste development are dysregulated compared with wild type. We demonstrate that expression of the WT1 target genes <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Bmp4</i> is significantly reduced in developing tongue tissue derived from <i>Wt1</i> knockout mice and that, in normal tongue, WT1 is bound to the promoter regions of these genes. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of WT1 in cultured taste cells leads to a reduction in the expression of <i>Lef1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. Our data identify WT1 as a crucial transcription factor in the development of the CV through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways that have established roles in the formation and patterning of taste placodes.</p>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hypertension caused by increased renin-angiotensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> activation is associated with elevated reactive oxygen species production. Previous studies implicate NADPH oxidase (Nox) proteins as important reactive oxygen species sources during renin-angiotensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> activation, with different Nox isoforms being potentially involved. Among these, Nox2 is expressed in multiple cell types, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, and microglia.

The lower BP was attributable to an increased NO bioavailability that dynamically dilated resistance vessels in vivo under basal conditions without a change in renal function.

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Glycerophosphocholine (GPC) metabolites modulate atherosclerosis and thus risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Preclinical CVD may start during adolescence. Here, we used targeted serum lipidomics to identify a new panel of GPCs, and tested whether any of these GPCs are associated, in adolescence, with classical risk factors of CVD, namely excess visceral fat (VF), elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, and atherogenic dyslipidemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied a population-based sample of 990 adolescents (12–18 years, 48% male), as part of the Saguenay Youth Study. Using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 69 serum GPCs within the 450 to 680 <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> range. We measured VF with MRI.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed several novel GPCs that were associated with multiple CVD risk factors. Most significantly, PC16:0/2:0 was negatively associated with VF (<i>P</i>=1.4×10<sup>–19</sup>), blood pressure (<i>P</i>=7.7×10<sup>–5</sup>), and fasting triacylglycerols (<i>P</i>=9.0×10<sup>–5</sup>), and PC14:1/0:0 was positively associated with VF (<i>P</i>=3.0×10<sup>–7</sup>), fasting insulin (<i>P</i>=5.4×10<sup>–32</sup>), and triacylglycerols (<i>P</i>=1.4×10<sup>–29</sup>). The Sobel test of mediation revealed that both GPCs mediated their respective relations between VF (as a potential primary exposure) and CVD risk factors (as outcomes, <i>P</i> values<1.3×10<sup>–3</sup>). Furthermore, a GPC shown recently to predict incident coronary heart disease in older adults, PC18:2/0:0, was associated with several CVD risk factors in adolescents; these associations were less strong than those with the newly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed GPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed novel GPCs strongly associated with multiple CVD risk factors in adolescents. These GPCs may be sensitive indicators of obesity-related risk for CVD outcomes in adults, and may improve biological understanding of CVD risk.</p></sec>

OsbZIP48, a HY5 Transcription Factor Ortholog, Exerts Pleiotropic Effects in Light-Regulated Development
<p>Plants have evolved an intricate network of sensory photoreceptors and signaling components to regulate their development. Among the light signaling components <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed to date, HY5, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, has been investigated extensively. However, most of the work on HY5 has been carried out in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), a dicot. In this study, based on homology search and phylogenetic analysis, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed three homologs of AtHY5 in monocots; however, AtHYH (HY5 homolog) homologs are absent in the monocots analyzed. Out of the three homologs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), we have functionally characterized <i>OsbZIP48</i>. <i>OsbZIP48</i> was able to complement the <i>Athy5</i> mutant. OsbZIP48 protein levels are developmentally regulated in rice. Moreover, the OsbZIP48 protein does not degrade in dark-grown rice and <i>Athy5</i> seedlings complemented with <i>OsbZIP48</i>, which is in striking contrast to AtHY5. In comparison with <i>AtHY5</i>, which does not cause any change in hypocotyl length when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, the overexpression of full-length <i>OsbZIP48</i> in rice transgenics reduced the plant height considerably. Microarray analysis revealed that <i>OsKO2</i>, which encodes <i>ent</i>-kaurene oxidase 2 of the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway, is down-regulated in <i>OsbZIP48<sup>OE</sup></i> and up-regulated in <i>OsbZIP48<sup>KD</sup></i> transgenics as compared with the wild type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsbZIP48 binds directly to the <i>OsKO2</i> promoter. The RNA interference lines and the T-DNA insertional mutant of <i>OsbZIP48</i> showed seedling-lethal phenotypes despite the fact that roots were more proliferative during early stages of development in the T-DNA insertional mutant. These data provide credible evidence that OsbZIP48 performs more diverse functions in a monocot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> like rice in comparison with its Arabidopsis ortholog, HY5.</p>

The Conserved and Unique Genetic Architecture of Kernel Size and Weight in Maize and Rice
<p>Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a major staple crop. Maize kernel size and weight are important contributors to its yield. Here, we measured kernel length, kernel width, kernel thickness, hundred kernel weight, and kernel test weight in 10 recombinant inbred line populations and dissected their genetic architecture using three statistical models. In total, 729 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed, many of which were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in all three models, including 22 major QTLs that each can explain more than 10% of phenotypic variation. To provide candidate genes for these QTLs, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 30 maize genes that are orthologs of 18 rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes reported to affect rice seed size or weight. Interestingly, 24 of these 30 genes are located in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed QTLs or within 1 Mb of the significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We further confirmed the effects of five genes on maize kernel size/weight in an independent association mapping panel with 540 lines by candidate gene association analysis. Lastly, the function of <i>ZmINCW1</i>, a homolog of rice <i>GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING1</i> that affects seed size and weight, was characterized in detail. <i>ZmINCW1</i> is close to QTL peaks for kernel size/weight (less than 1 Mb) and contains significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting kernel size/weight in the association panel. Overexpression of this gene can rescue the reduced weight of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homozygous mutant line in the <i>AtcwINV2</i> gene (Arabidopsis ortholog of <i>ZmINCW1</i>). These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms affecting seed development are conserved in maize, rice, and possibly Arabidopsis.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation of small molecules that integrate into biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic biology. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant biology. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>atically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield potential.</p>

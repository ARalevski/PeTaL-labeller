Asteroseismic detection of latitudinal differential rotation in 13 Sun-like stars
<p>The differentially rotating outer layers of stars are thought to play a role in driving their magnetic activity, but the underlying mechanisms that generate and sustain differential rotation are poorly understood. We report the measurement using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">asteroseismolog</span></strong>y of latitudinal differential rotation in the convection zones of 40 Sun-like stars. For the most significant detections, the starsâ€™ equators rotate approximately twice as fast as their midlatitudes. The latitudinal shear inferred from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">asteroseismolog</span></strong>y is much larger than predictions from numerical simulations.</p>

Pathologic Stimulus Determines Lineage Commitment of Cardiac C-kit<sup>+</sup> Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although cardiac c-kit<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are being tested in clinical trials, the circumstances that determine lineage differentiation of c-kit<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in vivo are unknown. Recent findings suggest that endogenous cardiac c-kit<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s rarely contribute cardiomyocytes to the adult heart.

TSLP signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells programs a pathogenic T helper 2 cell state
<p>Pathogenic T helper 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, which produce increased amounts of the cytokines interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13, promote allergic disorders, including asthma. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine secreted by epithelial and innate immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, stimulates such pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses. We found that TSLP signaling in mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s initiated transcriptional changes associated with T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> programming. IL-4 signaling amplified and stabilized the genomic response of T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to TSLP, which increased the frequency of T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Furthermore, the TSLP- and IL-4–programmed T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had a pathogenic phenotype, producing greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 and other proinflammatory cytokines than did T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s stimulated with IL-4 alone. TSLP-mediated T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> induction involved distinct molecular pathways, including activation of the transcription factor STAT5 through the kinase JAK2 and repression of the transcription factor BCL6. Mice that received wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had exacerbated pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses upon exposure to house dust mites compared to mice that received TSLP receptor–deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Transient TSLP signaling stably programmed pathogenic potential in memory T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. In human CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, TSLP and IL-4 promoted the generation of T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that produced greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13. Compared to healthy controls, asthmatic children showed enhancement of such T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses in peripheral blood. Our data support a sequential cytokine model for pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> differentiation and provide a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic targeting of TSLP signaling in human allergic diseases.</p>

IL-2Rβ abundance differentially tunes IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
<p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulates both activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to proliferate. IL-2 signals through an identical receptor complex and promotes the same dose-dependent phosphorylation of the canonical transcription factor STAT5 in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types. Despite this, CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s enter the S phase earlier and proliferate to a greater extent than do CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in response to IL-2. We identified distinct IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. In IL-2–stimulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, STAT5 phosphorylation increased rapidly and was sustained for 6 hours. In contrast, CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had a biphasic response, with maxima at 15 min and 2 to 4 hours after stimulation. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types required vesicular trafficking, but only CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s required new protein synthesis to maintain high phosphorylation of STAT5. Two subunits of the IL-2 receptor, IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, were twice as abundant in CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s than in CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Reduction of IL-2Rβ abundance by 50% was sufficient to convert CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to a CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–like signaling pattern and delay S phase entry. These results suggest that the larger pool of IL-2Rβ chains in CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s is required to sustain IL-2 signaling and contributes to the quantitatively greater proliferative response to IL-2 relative to that of CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type–specific difference in IL-2Rβ abundance appears to tune responses, potentially preventing extensive, autoimmune proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, while still enabling sufficient proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to control viral infections.</p>

Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> invasion. It is generally thought that migrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s grab and exert traction force onto the extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular matrix in order to pull the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> body forward. While previous studies have shown that myosin II deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s migrate efficiently, whether these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s exert traction forces during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a force sensor and shRNA specific to each myosin II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how myosin IIA and IIB individually regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration and traction force generation. Myosin IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction force was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual myosin II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, myosin IIA deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s lost actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas myosin IIB deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s maintained similar actin organization and focal adhesions as wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Interestingly, myosin IIA deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s migrated faster than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet myosin IIA deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s exerted significantly less traction force at the leading edge than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. These results suggest that, in the absence of myosin IIA mediated force-generating machinery, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s move with minimal traction forces at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to adapt and migrate.</p>

Cytoskeletal adaptivity regulates T cell receptor signaling
<p>The factors that govern T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation control the initiation and progression of adaptive immune responses. T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s recognize their cognate antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (APCs) through the T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> receptor, which results in the formation of a contact region (immune synapse) between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and the activation of the T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Activated T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s proliferate and differentiate into effector T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that secrete cytokines, provide help to B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and kill target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We asked whether the actin cytoskeleton governs differences in signaling in effector T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s versus naive (unstimulated) T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Using atomic force microscopy and quantitative confocal microscopy, we found that naive T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had a mechanically stiffer cortical cytoskeleton than that of effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, which resulted in naive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s forming smaller immune synapses with APCs. This suggests that the cytoskeletal stiffness of the T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> before it undergoes antigen stimulation predicts its subsequent dynamic engagement with APCs and its activation potential. Cytoskeletal rigidity depended on the activity of the actin-severing enzyme cofilin through a pathway requiring the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoA and the kinases ROCK (Rho-activated kinase) and LIMK. These findings suggest that the baseline cytoskeletal state controls T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses and that the underlying pathway could be a therapeutic target for modulating adaptive immunity.</p>

Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and groups of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular and molecular control of a lobed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall generate local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> shape and are unstable at the time scales of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> geometry, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>

A dynamic cell adhesion surface regulates tissue architecture in growth plate cartilage
<p>The architecture and morphogenetic properties of tissues are founded in the tissue-specific regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> behaviors. In endochondral bones, the growth plate cartilage promotes bone elongation via regulated chondrocyte maturation within an ordered, three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> array. A key event in the process that generates this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> array is the transformation of disordered resting chondrocytes into clonal columns of discoid proliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s aligned with the primary growth vector. Previous analysis showed that column-forming chondrocytes display planar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> divisions, and the resulting daughter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s rearrange by ∼90° to align with the lengthening column. However, these previous studies provided limited information about the mechanisms underlying this dynamic process. Here we present new mechanistic insights generated by application of a novel time-lapse confocal microscopy method along with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We show that, during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> division, daughter chondrocytes establish a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion surface enriched in cadherins and β-catenin. Rearrangement into columns occurs concomitant with expansion of this adhesion surface in a process more similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> spreading than to migration. Column formation requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion, as reducing cadherin binding via chelation of extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular calcium inhibits chondrocyte rearrangement. Importantly, physical indicators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> polarity, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> body alignment, are not prerequisites for oriented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> behavior. Our results support a model in which regulation of adhesive surface dynamics and cortical tension by extrinsic signaling modifies the thermodynamic landscape to promote organization of daughter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in the context of the three-dimensional growth plate tissue.</p>

R-Ras2 is required for germinal center formation to aid B cells during energetically demanding processes
<p>Upon antigen recognition within peripheral lymphoid organs, B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s interact with T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and other immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to transiently form morphological structures called germinal centers (GCs), which are required for B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> clonal expansion, immunoglobulin class switching, and affinity maturation. This process, known as the GC response, is an energetically demanding process that requires the metabolic reprogramming of B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We showed that the Ras-related guanosine triphosphate hydrolase (GTPase) R-Ras2 (also known as TC21) plays an essential, nonredundant, and B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–intrinsic role in the GC response. Both the conversion of B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s into GC B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and their expansion were impaired in mice lacking R-Ras2, but not in those lacking a highly related R-Ras subfamily member or both the classic H-Ras and N-Ras GTPases. In the absence of R-Ras2, activated B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s did not exhibit increased oxidative phosphorylation or aerobic glycolysis. We showed that R-Ras2 was an effector of both the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> receptor (BCR) and CD40 and that, in its absence, B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s exhibited impaired activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway, reduced mitochondrial DNA replication, and decreased expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism. Because most human B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lymphomas originate from GC B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s or B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that have undergone the GC response, our data suggest that R-Ras2 may also regulate metabolism in B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> malignancies.</p>

Educated natural killer cells show dynamic movement of the activating receptor NKp46 and confinement of the inhibitory receptor Ly49A
<p>Educated natural killer (NK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s have inhibitory receptors specific for self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and kill cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s more efficiently than do NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that do not have such receptors (hyporesponsive NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s). The mechanism behind this functional empowerment through education has so far not been fully described. In addition, distinctive phenotypic markers of educated NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> level are lacking. We developed a refined version of the image mean square displacement (iMSD) method (called iMSD carpet analysis) and used it in combination with single-particle tracking to characterize the dynamics of the activating receptor NKp46 and the inhibitory receptor Ly49A on resting educated versus hyporesponsive murine NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Most of the NKp46 and Ly49A molecules were restricted to microdomains; however, individual NKp46 molecules resided in these domains for shorter periods and diffused faster on the surface of educated, compared to hyporesponsive, NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. In contrast, the movement of Ly49A was more constrained in educated NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s compared to hyporesponsive NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Either disrupting the actin cytoskeleton or adding cholesterol to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s prohibited activating signaling, suggesting that the dynamics of receptor movements within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> membrane are critical for the proper activation of NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. The faster and more dynamic movement of NKp46 in educated NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s may facilitate a swifter response to interactions with target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s.</p>

Tim-3 signaling in peripheral NK cells promotes maternal-fetal immune tolerance and alleviates pregnancy loss
<p>Pregnancy loss occurs in about 15% of clinically recognized pregnancies, and defective maternal-fetal immune tolerance contributes to more than 50% of these events. We found that signaling by the type I membrane protein T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> immunoglobulin and mucin-containing protein 3 (Tim-3) in natural killer (NK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had an essential protective role during early pregnancy. Tim-3 on peripheral NK (pNK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was transiently increased in abundance during the first trimester of pregnancy, which depended on interleukin-4 (IL-4)–signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and progesterone signaling. Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s displayed immunosuppressive activities, including the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of regulatory T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (T<sub>regs</sub>) in a transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1)–dependent manner. Tim-3 on pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was stimulated by its ligand galectin-9 (Gal-9), leading to signaling by the kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AKT. In recurrent miscarriage (RM) patients, Tim-3 abundance on pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was reduced and the immunosuppressive activity of Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was impaired. Compared to Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from donors with normal pregnancies, RM patient Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s exhibited changes in DNA accessibility in certain genetic loci, which were reversed by inhibiting accessible chromatin reader proteins. Furthermore, Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, but not Tim-3<sup>−</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, reduced fetal loss in abortion-prone and NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–deficient mice. Together, our findings reveal a critical role for Tim-3–Gal-9 signaling–mediated immunoregulation by pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in maternal-fetal immune tolerance and suggest that Tim-3 abundance on pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s is a potential biomarker for RM diagnosis.</p>

Blockade of surface-bound TGF-β on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress antitumor immunity by inhibiting the killing of tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel cultures of dissociated B16 melanoma tumors. This system recapitulated the in vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the dissociated tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Immunosuppression was not observed when tumors excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) also prevented immunosuppression. Immunosuppression depended on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> contact or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not inhibit tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> killing by T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that tumor-specific Pmel-1 effector T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s physically interacted with tumor-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice. T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from B16 tumors alone were sufficient to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–mediated killing, which depended on surface-bound TGF-β on the T<sub>regs</sub>. Immunosuppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic protein granzyme B and an increase in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings suggest that contact between T<sub>regs</sub> and antitumor T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in the tumor microenvironment inhibits antimelanoma immunity in a TGF-β–dependent manner and highlight potential ways to inhibit intratumoral T<sub>regs</sub> therapeutically.</p>

Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Resolves Molecular Relationships Among Individual Plant Cells
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been used extensively to study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-specific gene expression in animals, but it has not been widely applied to plants. Here, we describe the use of a commercially available droplet-based microfluidics platform for high-throughput scRNA-seq to obtain single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> transcriptomes from protoplasts of more than 10,000 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We find that all major tissues and developmental stages are represented in this single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> transcriptome population. Further, distinct subpopulations and rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types, including putative quiescent center <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, were identified. A focused analysis of root epidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> transcriptomes defined developmental trajectories for individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s progressing from meristematic through mature stages of root-hair and nonhair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> differentiation. In addition, single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> transcriptomes were obtained from root epidermis mutants, enabling a comparative analysis of gene expression at single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion and providing an unprecedented view of the impact of the mutated genes. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of scRNA-seq in plants and provides a first-generation gene expression map of the Arabidopsis root at single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion.</p>

A defect in KCa3.1 channel activity limits the ability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from cancer patients to infiltrate an adenosine-rich microenvironment
<p>The limited ability of cytotoxic T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to infiltrate solid tumors hampers immune surveillance and the efficacy of immunotherapies in cancer. Adenosine accumulates in solid tumors and inhibits tumor-specific T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Adenosine inhibits T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> motility through the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) and suppression of KCa3.1 channels. We conducted three-dimensional chemotaxis experiments to elucidate the effect of adenosine on the migration of peripheral blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from head and neck squamous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. The chemotaxis of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was reduced in the presence of adenosine, and the effect was greater on HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s than on healthy donor (HD) CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. This response correlated with the inability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to infiltrate tumors. The effect of adenosine was mimicked by an A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist and prevented by an A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist. We found no differences in A<sub>2A</sub>R expression, 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate abundance, or protein kinase A type 1 activity between HNSCC and HD CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We instead detected a decrease in KCa3.1 channel activity, but not expression, in HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Activation of KCa3.1 channels by 1-EBIO restored the ability of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to chemotax in the presence of adenosine. Our data highlight the mechanism underlying the increased sensitivity of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to adenosine and the potential therapeutic benefit of KCa3.1 channel activators, which could increase infiltration of these T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s into tumors.</p>

The Receptor-Like Kinase AtVRLK1 Regulates Secondary Cell Wall Thickening
<p>During the growth and development of land plants, some specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, such as tracheary elements, undergo secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening. Secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls contain additional lignin, compared with primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls, thus providing mechanical strength and potentially improving defenses against pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms that initiate wall thickening are unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, encoded by <i>AtVRLK1</i> (<i>Vascular-Related Receptor-Like Kinase1</i>), that is expressed specifically in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s undergoing secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening. Suppression of <i>AtVRLK1</i> expression resulted in a range of phenotypes that included retarded early elongation of the inflorescence stem, shorter fibers, slower root growth, and shorter flower filaments. In contrast, up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> led to longer fiber <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, reduced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening in fiber and vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and defects in anther dehiscence. Molecular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular analyses showed that down-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> promoted secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening and up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation and inhibited secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening. We propose that AtVRLK1 functions as a signaling component in coordinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening during growth and development.</p>

Cell-Fate Specification in Arabidopsis Roots Requires Coordinative Action of Lineage Instruction and Positional Reprogramming
<p>Tissue organization and pattern formation within a multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular organism rely on coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> division and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate determination. In animals, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fates are mainly determined by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lineage-dependent mechanism, whereas in plants, positional information is thought to be the primary determinant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fates. However, our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate regulation in plants mostly relies on the histological and anatomical studies on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, which contain a single layer of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type in nonvascular tissues. Here, we investigate the dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate acquisition in modified Arabidopsis roots with additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> layers that are artificially generated by the misexpression of <i>SHORT-ROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>). We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate determination in Arabidopsis roots is a dimorphic cascade with lineage inheritance dominant in the early stage of pattern formation. The inherited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> identity can subsequently be removed or modified by positional information. The instruction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate conversion is not a fast readout during root development. The final identity of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type is determined by the synergistic contribution from multiple layers of regulation, including symplastic communication across tissues. Our findings underline the collaborative inputs during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate instruction.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The adhesion of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are examples of this. Border <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (in some species known as border-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s) provide an expendable barrier between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> separation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified multiple novel modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> maturation and enable us to develop a model of the separation process. We propose that loss of adhesion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

Profiling the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force in B cell activation
<p>B lymphocytes use B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> receptors (BCRs) to recognize membrane-bound antigens to further initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> spreading and contraction responses during B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation. We combined traction force microscopy and live-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> imaging to profile the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force generation in these responses. We showed that B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation required the generation of 10 to 20 nN of traction force when encountering antigens presented by substrates with stiffness values from 0.5 to 1 kPa, which mimic the rigidity of antigen-presenting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in vivo. Perturbation experiments revealed that F-actin remodeling and myosin- and dynein-mediated contractility contributed to traction force generation and B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation. Moreover, membrane-proximal BCR signaling molecules (including Lyn, Syk, Btk, PLC-γ2, BLNK, and Vav3) and adaptor molecules (Grb2, Cbl, and Dok-3) linking BCR microclusters and motor proteins were also required for the sustained generation of these traction forces. We found a positive correlation between the strength of the traction force and the mean fluorescence intensity of the BCR microclusters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that isotype-switched memory B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s expressing immunoglobulin G (IgG)–BCRs generated greater traction forces than did mature naive B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s expressing IgM-BCRs during B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation. Last, we observed that primary B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from patients with rheumatoid arthritis generated greater traction forces than did B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from healthy donors in response to antigen stimulation. Together, these data delineate the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force during B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Olfactomedin-1 activity identifies a cell invasion checkpoint during epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the chick embryonic heart
<p>Endothelia in the atrioventricular (AV) canal of the developing heart undergo a prototypical epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) to begin heart valve formation. Using an <i>in vitro</i> invasion assay, an extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular matrix protein, Olfactomedin-1 (OLFM1), was found to increase mesenchymal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> numbers in AV canals from embryonic chick hearts. Treatment with both anti-OLFM1 antibody and siRNA targeting OLFM1 inhibits mesenchymal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> formation. OLFM1 does not alter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> proliferation, migration or apoptosis. Dispersion, but lack of invasion in the presence of inhibiting antibody, identifies a specific role for OLFM1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> invasion during EMT. This role is conserved in other epithelia, as OLFM1 similarly enhances invasion by MDCK epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in a transwell assay. Synergy is observed when TGFβ2 and OLFM1 are added to MDCK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> cultures, indicating that OLFM-1 activity is cooperative with TGFβ. Inhibition of both OLFM1 and TGFβ in heart invasion assays shows a similar cooperative role during development. To explore OLFM1 activity during EMT, representative EMT markers were examined. Effects of OLFM1 protein and anti-OLFM1 on transcripts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion molecules and the transcription factors <i>Snail-1, Snail-2, Twist1</i> and <i>Sox-9</i> argue that OLFM1 does not initiate EMT. Rather, regulation of transcripts of <i>Zeb1</i> and <i>Zeb2</i>, secreted proteases and mesenchymal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> markers by both OLFM1 and anti-OLFM1 is consistent with regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> invasion step of EMT. We conclude that OLFM1 is present and necessary during EMT in the embryonic chick heart. Its role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> invasion and mesenchymal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> gene regulation suggests an invasion checkpoint in EMT where OLFM1 acts to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> invasion into the three-dimensional matrix.</p>

Inhibition of JAK-STAT Signaling Suppresses Pathogenic Immune Responses in Medium and Large Vessel Vasculitis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> arteritis, a chronic autoimmune disease of the aorta and its large branches, is complicated by aneurysm formation, dissection, and arterial occlusions. Arterial wall dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s attract CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and macrophages to form prototypic granulomatous infiltrates. Vasculitic lesions contain a diverse array of effector T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that persist despite corticosteroid therapy and sustain chronic, smoldering vasculitis.

CD73 on T Cells Orchestrates Cardiac Wound Healing After Myocardial Infarction by Purinergic Metabolic Reprogramming
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are required for proper healing after myocardial infarction. The mechanism of their beneficial action, however, is unknown. The proinflammatory danger signal ATP, released from damaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, is degraded by the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 to the anti-inflammatory mediator adenosine. Here, we investigate the contribution of CD73-derived adenosine produced by T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to cardiac remodeling after ischemia/reperfusion and define its mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Myocardial ischemia (50 minutes followed by reperfusion) was induced in global CD73<sup>−/−</sup> and CD4-CD73<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup> mice. Tissue injury, T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> purinergic signaling, cytokines, and cardiac function (magnetic resonance tomography at 9.4 T over 4 weeks) were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Changes in functional parameters of CD4-CD73<sup>−/−</sup> mice were identical to those in global CD73 knockouts (KOs). T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s infiltrating the injured heart significantly upregulated at the gene (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and protein (enzymatic activity) levels critical transporters and enzymes (connexin43, connexin37, pannexin-1, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1, CD39, CD73, ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3, CD157, CD38) for the accelerated release and hydrolysis of ATP, cAMP, AMP, and NAD to adenosine. It is surprising that a lack of CD39 on T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (from CD39<sup>−/−</sup> mice) did not alter ATP hydrolysis and very likely involves pyrophosphatases (ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3). Circulating T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s predominantly expressed A<sub>2a</sub> receptor (A<sub>2a</sub>R) transcripts. After myocardial infarction, A<sub>2b</sub> receptor (A<sub>2b</sub>R) transcription was induced in both T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and myeloid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in the heart. Thus, A<sub>2a</sub>R and A<sub>2b</sub>R signaling may contribute to myocardial responses after myocardial infarction. In the case of T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, this was associated with an accelerated secretion of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines (interleukin-2, interferon-γ, and interleukin-17) when CD73 was lacking. Cytokine production by T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from peripheral lymph nodes was inhibited by A<sub>2a</sub>R activation (CGS-21680). The A<sub>2b</sub>R agonist BAY 60-6583 showed off-target effects. The adenosine receptor agonist NECA inhibited interferon-γ and stimulated interleukin-6 production, each of which was antagonized by a specific A<sub>2b</sub>R antagonist (PSB-603).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work demonstrates that CD73 on T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s plays a crucial role in the cardiac wound healing process after myocardial infarction. The underlying mechanism involves a profound increase in the hydrolysis of ATP/NAD and AMP, resulting primarily from the upregulation of pyrophosphatases and CD73.

The lower BP was attributable to an increased NO bioavailability that dynamically dilated resistance vessels in vivo under basal conditions without a change in renal function.

A SAP domain-containing protein shuttles between the nucleus and cell membranes and plays a role in adhesion and migration in <i>D. discoideum</i>
<p>The AmpA protein reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion, thereby influencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. To understand how <i>ampA</i> influences <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration, second site suppressors of an AmpA overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> line were created by REMI mutagenesis. Mutant candidates were identified by their ability to suppress the large plaques that the AmpA overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s form on bacterial lawns as a result of their increased rate of migration. One suppressor gene, <i>sma</i>, encodes an uncharacterized protein, which contains a SAP DNA-binding domain and a PTEN-like domain. Using <i>sma</i> gene knockouts and Sma-mRFP expressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines, a role for <i>sma</i> in influencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration was uncovered. Knockouts of the <i>sma</i> gene in a wild-type background enhanced chemotaxis. An additional role for Sma in influencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion was also demonstrated. Sma protein transitions between cytosolic and nuclear localizations as a function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> density. In growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s migrating to folic acid it is localized to regions of actin polymerization and absent from the nucleus. A role for Sma in influencing <i>ampA</i> mRNA levels is also demonstrated. Sma additionally appears to be involved in <i>ampA</i> pathways regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> size, actin polymerization, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> substrate adhesion. We present insights to the SAP domain-containing group of proteins in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and provide evidence of a role for a SAP domain-containing protein shuttling from the nucleus to sites of actin polymerization during chemotaxis to folic acid and influencing the efficiency of migration.</p>

A TGFβ–miR-182–BRCA1 axis controls the mammary differentiation hierarchy
<p>Maintenance of mammary functional capacity during cycles of proliferation and regression depends on appropriate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fate decisions of mammary progenitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to populate an epithelium consisting of secretory luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and contractile myoepithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. It is well established that transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) restricts mammary epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> proliferation and that sensitivity to TGFβ is decreased in breast cancer. We show that TGFβ also exerts control of mammary progenitor self-renewal and lineage commitment decisions by stringent regulation of breast cancer associated 1 (BRCA1), which controls stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> self-renewal and lineage commitment. Either genetic depletion of <i>Tgfb1</i> or transient blockade of TGFβ increased self-renewal of mammary progenitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in mice, cultured primary mammary epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and also skewed lineage commitment toward the myoepithelial fate. TGFβ stabilized the abundance of BRCA1 by reducing the abundance of microRNA-182 (miR-182). Ectopic expression of BRCA1 or antagonism of miR-182 in cultured TGFβ-deficient mammary epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s restored luminal lineage commitment. These findings reveal that TGFβ modulation of BRCA1 directs mammary epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fate and, because stem or progenitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are thought to be the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> of origin for aggressive breast cancer subtypes, suggest that TGFβ dysregulation during tumorigenesis may promote distinct breast cancer subtypes.</p>

CD13 tethers the IQGAP1-ARF6-EFA6 complex to the plasma membrane to promote ARF6 activation, β1 integrin recycling, and cell migration
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> attachment to the extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular matrix (ECM) requires a balance between integrin internalization and recycling to the surface that is mediated by numerous proteins, emphasizing the complexity of these processes. Upon ligand binding in various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, the β1 integrin is internalized, traffics to early endosomes, and is returned to the plasma membrane through recycling endosomes. This trafficking process depends on the cyclical activation and inactivation of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) by their specific guanine exchange factors (GEFs) and their GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). In this study, we found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> surface antigen CD13, a multifunctional transmembrane molecule that regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion and receptor-mediated endocytosis, also promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration and colocalized with β1 integrin at sites of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion and at the leading edge. A lack of CD13 resulted in aberrant trafficking of internalized β1 integrin to late endosomes and its ultimate degradation. Our data indicate that CD13 promoted ARF6 GTPase activity by positioning the ARF6-GEF EFA6 at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> membrane. In migrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, a complex containing phosphorylated CD13, IQGAP1, GTP-bound (active) ARF6, and EFA6 at the leading edge promoted the ARF6 GTPase cycling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration. Together, our findings uncover a role for CD13 in the fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular processes of receptor recycling, regulation of small GTPase activities, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-ECM interactions, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration.</p>

TGF-β–mediated enhancement of T<sub>H</sub>17 cell generation is inhibited by bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1α signaling
<p>The cytokines of the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) family promote the growth and differentiation of multiple tissues, but the role of only the founding member, TGF-β, in regulating the immune responses has been extensively studied. TGF-β is critical to prevent the spontaneous activation of self-reactive T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and sustain immune homeostasis. In contrast, in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, TGF-β promotes the differentiation of effector T helper 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Abrogating TGF-β receptor signaling prevents the development of interleukin-17 (IL-17)–secreting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and protects mice from T<sub>H</sub>17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–mediated autoimmunity. We found that the receptor of another member of TGF-β family, bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1α (BMPR1α), regulates T helper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation. We found that the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was inhibited in the presence of BMPs. Abrogation of BMPR1α signaling during CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation induced a developmental program that led to the generation of inflammatory effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s expressing large amounts of IL-17, IFN-γ, and TNF family cytokines and transcription factors defining the T<sub>H</sub>17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lineage. We found that TGF-β and BMPs cooperated to establish effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> functions and the cytokine profile of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Together, our data provide insight into the immunoregulatory function of BMPs.</p>

TCR-stimulated changes in cell surface CD46 expression generate type 1 regulatory T cells
<p>A lack of regulatory T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> function is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Ligation of the complement regulatory protein CD46 facilitates the differentiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s into interleukin-10 (IL-10)–secreting type 1 regulatory T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (Tr1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s), and this pathway is defective in MS patients. Cleavage of the ectodomain of CD46, which contains three N-glycosylation sites and multiple O-glycosylation sites, enables CD46 to activate T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We found that stimulation of the T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> receptor (TCR)–CD3 complex was associated with a reduction in the apparent molecular mass of CD46 in a manner that depended on O-glycosylation. CD3-stimulated changes in CD46 O-glycosylation status reduced CD46 processing and subsequent T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> signaling. During T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation, CD46 was recruited to the immune synapse in a manner that required its serine-, threonine-, and proline-rich (STP) region, which is rich in O-glycosylation sites. Recruitment of CD46 to the immune synapse switched T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from producing the inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to producing IL-10. Furthermore, CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s isolated from MS patients did not exhibit a CD3-stimulated reduction in the mass of CD46 and thus showed increased amounts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> surface CD46. Together, these data suggest a possible mechanism underlying the regulatory function of CD46 on T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Our findings may explain why this pathway is defective in patients with MS and provide insights into MS pathogenesis that could help to design future immunotherapies.</p>

Intercellular transmission of the unfolded protein response promotes survival and drug resistance in cancer cells
<p>Increased protein translation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and various factors in the tumor microenvironment can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR). We have previously reported that factors released from cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s mounting a UPR induce a de novo UPR in bone marrow–derived myeloid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, macrophages, and dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that facilitates protumorigenic characteristics in culture and tumor growth in vivo. We investigated whether this inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular signaling, which we have termed transmissible ER stress (TERS), also operates between cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and what its functional consequences were within the tumor. We found that TERS signaling induced a UPR in recipient human prostate cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that included the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> surface expression of the chaperone GRP78. TERS also activated Wnt signaling in recipient cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and enhanced resistance to nutrient starvation and common chemotherapies such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel. TERS-induced activation of Wnt signaling required the UPR kinase and endonuclease IRE1. However, TERS-induced enhancement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> survival was predominantly mediated by the UPR kinase PERK and a reduction in the abundance of the transcription factor ATF4, which prevented the activation of the transcription factor CHOP and, consequently, the induction of apoptosis. When implanted in mice, TERS-primed cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s gave rise to faster growing tumors than did vehicle-primed cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Collectively, our data demonstrate that TERS is a mechanism of inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular communication through which tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s can adapt to stressful environments.</p>

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular systems show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as oscillations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics focus on one or a few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> reporters for 12 cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines, we found that p53 abundance oscillated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was fixed. In other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

Supracellular contractions propel migration
<p>Constructing multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular bodies, starting from a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> zygote, often requires the movement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s across considerable distances, which is achieved through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration. During embryonic development, as well as in healing and regeneration, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s travel across diverse terrains, which dictates the character of navigation (<i>1</i>). Cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s metastasize and migrate into healthy organs, and knowledge of their migration strategies could be important to identify targets to treat advanced disease (<i>2</i>). Some migratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s cover large distances individually (<i>3</i>), whereas others migrate in groups, with leaders and followers being directed by chemical signals (chemotaxis) (<i>4</i>, <i>5</i>). The exchange of information and resulting motility of such groups has been enigmatic. Moreover, the driving force of collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration has been considered a sum of migratory and signaling activities of individually participating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. However, according to a study on page 339 of this issue by Shellard <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>), collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration requires formation of cytoskeletal structures that span through adjoining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s at the rear of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> group to coordinate, orient, and propel the entire group. This mechanism of collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration could be applicable to cancer metastasis and wound healing and might change our understanding of developmental migration.</p>

Differential IL-2 expression defines developmental fates of follicular versus nonfollicular helper T cells

Interleukin-2 (IL-2), the major cytokine produced by naive T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, plays an important role in the developmental divergence of these populations. However, the relationship between IL-2 production and fate determination remains unclear. Using reporter mice, we found that differential production of IL-2 by naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s defined precursors fated for different immune functions. IL-2 producers, which were fated to become T<sub>FH</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, delivered IL-2 to nonproducers destined to become non-T<sub>FH</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Because IL-2 production was limited to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s receiving the strongest T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> receptor (TCR) signals, a direct link between TCR-signal strength, IL-2 production, and T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fate determination has been established.</p>

Three-dimensional genome structures of single diploid human cells
<p>Three-dimensional genome structures play a key role in gene regulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> functions. Characterization of genome structures necessitates single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> measurements. This has been achieved for haploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s but has remained a challenge for diploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We developed a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> chromatin conformation capture method, termed Dip-C, that combines a transposon-based whole-genome amplification method to detect many chromatin contacts, called META (multiplex end-tagging amplification), and an algorithm to impute the two chromosome haplotypes linked by each contact. We reconstructed the genome structures of single diploid human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from a lymphoblastoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> line and from primary blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s with high spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, locating specific single-nucleotide and copy number variations in the nucleus.

Actin Reorganization Triggers Rapid Cell Elongation in Roots
<p>Root growth is controlled by mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> division and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation, which respond to various internal and external factors. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s produced in the proximal meristem (PM) elongate and differentiate in the transition zone (TZ) and the elongation/differentiation zone (EDZ). Previous studies have demonstrated that endoreplication is involved in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation; however, the manner by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s increase in length by more than 2-fold remains unknown. Here, we show that epidermal and cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in Arabidopsis roots undergo two modes of rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation: the first rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation occurs at the border of the proximal meristem and the TZ, and the second mode occurs during the transition from the TZ to the EDZ. Our previous study showed that cytokinin signaling promotes endoreplication, which triggers the first rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation. Our cytological and genetic data revealed that the second rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation involves dynamic actin reorganization independent of endoreplication. Cytokinins promote actin bundling and the resultant second rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation through activating the signaling pathway involving the cytokinin receptors ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE3 (AHK3) and AHK4 and the B-type transcription factor ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR2. Our results suggest that cytokinins promote the two modes of rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation by controlling distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular events: endoreplication and actin reorganization.</p>

Branched Pectic Galactan in Phloem-Sieve-Element Cell Walls: Implications for Cell Mechanics
<p>A major question in plant biology concerns the specification and functional differentiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types. This is in the context of constraints imposed by networks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls that both adhere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and contribute to the form and function of developing organs. Here, we report the identification of a glycan epitope that is specific to phloem sieve element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls in several systems. A monoclonal antibody, designated LM26, binds to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall of phloem sieve elements in stems of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>Miscanthus</i> x <i>giganteus</i>, and notably sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>) roots where phloem identification is an important factor for the study of phloem unloading of Suc. Using microarrays of synthetic oligosaccharides, the LM26 epitope has been identified as a β-1,6-galactosyl substitution of β-1,4-galactan requiring more than three backbone residues for optimized recognition. This branched galactan structure has previously been identified in garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) bulbs in which the LM26 epitope is widespread throughout most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls including those of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Garlic bulb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall material has been used to confirm the association of the LM26 epitope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall pectic rhamnogalacturonan-I polysaccharides. In the phloem tissues of grass stems, the LM26 epitope has a complementary pattern to that of the LM5 linear β-1,4-galactan epitope, which is detected only in companion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls. Mechanical probing of transverse sections of <i>M</i>. x <i>giganteus</i> stems and leaves by atomic force microscopy indicates that phloem sieve element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls have a lower indentation modulus (indicative of higher elasticity) than companion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls.</p>

Microtubule Array Patterns Have a Common Underlying Architecture in Hypocotyl Cells
<p>Microtubules at the plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> cortex influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> shape by patterning the deposition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall materials. The elongated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s of the hypocotyl create a variety of microtubule array patterns with differing degrees of polymer coalignment and orientation to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>’s growth axis. To gain insight into the mechanisms driving array organization, we investigated the underlying microtubule array architecture in light-grown epidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s with explicit reference to array pattern. We discovered that all nontransverse patterns share a common underlying array architecture, having a core unimodal peak of coaligned microtubules in a split bipolarized arrangement. The growing microtubule plus ends extend toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>’s apex and base with a region of antiparallel microtubule overlap at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>’s midzone. This core coalignment continuously shifts between ±30° from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>’s longitudinal growth axis, forming a continuum of longitudinal and oblique arrays. Transverse arrays exhibit the same unimodal core coalignment but form local domains of microtubules polymerizing in the same direction rather than a split bipolarized architecture. Quantitative imaging experiments and analysis of <i>katanin</i> mutants showed that the longitudinal arrays are created from microtubules originating on the outer periclinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> face, pointing to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-directed, rather than self-organizing, mechanism for specifying the major array pattern classes in the hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Human Cells in Terms of Protein Innovation
<p>Humans are composed of hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types. As the genomic DNA of each somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> is identical, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type is determined by what is expressed and when. Until recently, little has been reported about the determinants of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> identity, particularly from the joint perspective of gene evolution and expression. Here, we chart the evolutionary past of all documented human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types via the collective histories of proteins, the principal product of gene expression. FANTOM5 data provide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-type–specific digital expression of human protein-coding genes and the SUPERFAMILY resource is used to provide protein domain annotation. The evolutionary epoch in which each protein was created is inferred by comparison with domain annotation of all other completely sequenced genomes. Studying the distribution across epochs of genes expressed in each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type reveals insights into human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular evolution in terms of protein innovation. For each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type, its history of protein innovation is charted based on the genes it expresses. Combining the histories of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types enables us to create a timeline of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> evolution. This timeline identifies the possibility that our common ancestor Coelomata (cavity-forming animals) provided the innovation required for the innate immune system, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s which now form the brain of human have followed a trajectory of continually accumulating novel proteins since Opisthokonta (boundary of animals and fungi). We conclude that exaptation of existing domain architectures into new contexts is the dominant source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-type–specific domain architectures.</p>

Using high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion <i>in situ</i> hybridization together with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lineage and proliferation markers in mouse skin, we show that miR-203 is transcriptionally activated in the differentiating daughter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s upon the asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> division of interfollicular progenitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Once induced, miR-203 rapidly promotes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> cycle exit within 6 hours and abolishes self-renewal of the progenitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. With an inducible mouse model, we identify numerous miR-203 <i>in vivo</i> targets that are highly enriched in regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> cycle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> division, as well as in response to DNA damage. Importantly, co-suppression of individual targets, including p63, Skp2 and Msi2 by miR-203 is required for its function of promoting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> cycle exit and inhibiting the long-term proliferation. Together, our findings reveal the rapid and widespread impact of miR-203 on the self-renewal program and provide mechanistic insights into the potent role of miR-203 during the epidermal differentiation. These results should also contribute to understanding the role of miR-203 in the development of skin cancer.</p>

Single-Cell Sequencing of the Healthy and Diseased Heart Reveals Cytoskeleton-Associated Protein 4 as a New Modulator of Fibroblasts Activation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Genome-wide transcriptome analysis has greatly advanced our understanding of the regulatory networks underlying basic cardiac biology and mechanisms driving disease. However, so far, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion of studying gene expression patterns in the adult heart has been limited to the level of extracts from whole tissues. The use of tissue homogenates inherently causes the loss of any information on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular origin or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type-specific changes in gene expression.

Furthermore, applying single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> sequencing on both the healthy and injured heart indicated the presence of disease-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> subpopulations. As such, we identified cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 as a novel marker for activated fibroblasts that positively correlates with known myofibroblast markers in both mouse and human cardiac tissue. Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 inhibition in activated fibroblasts treated with transforming growth factor β triggered a greater increase in the expression of genes related to activated fibroblasts compared with control, suggesting a role of cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 in modulating fibroblast activation in the injured heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> sequencing on both the healthy and diseased adult heart allows us to study transcriptomic differences between cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type-specific changes in gene expression during cardiac disease.

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed ion channels that regulate the intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular concentration of ions and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an ion channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cation channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, a B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> line; however, deletion of TRPM7 in T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s does not impair their development. We found that expression of TRPM7 was required for B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s failed to generate peripheral B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s because of a developmental block at the pro-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proportion of peripheral mature B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s or the development of B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in the bone marrow. However, supplementation with a high concentration of extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 ion channel activity in B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> development.</p>

Ligand-activated Notch undergoes DTX4-mediated ubiquitylation and bilateral endocytosis before ADAM10 processing
<p>The Notch signaling pathway, which is activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> contact, is a major regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fate decisions. Mammalian Notch1 is present at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> surface as a heterodimer of the Notch extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular domain associated with the transmembrane and intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular domains. After ligand binding, Notch undergoes proteolysis, releasing the Notch intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular domain (NICD) that regulates gene expression. We monitored the early steps of activation with biochemical analysis, immunofluorescence analysis, and live-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> imaging of Notch1-expressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We found that, upon ligand binding, Notch1 at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> surface was ubiquitylated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX4. This ubiquitylation event led to the internalization of the Notch1 extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular domain by the ligand-expressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> and the internalization of the membrane-anchored fragment of Notch1 and DTX4 by the Notch1-expressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>, which we referred to as bilateral endocytosis. ADAM10 generates a cleavage product of Notch that is necessary for the formation of the NICD, which has been thought to occur at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> surface. However, we found that blocking dynamin-mediated endocytosis of Notch1 and DTX4 reduced the colocalization of Notch1 with ADAM10 and the formation of the ADAM10-generated cleavage product of Notch1, suggesting that ADAM10 functions in an intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular compartment to process Notch. Thus, this study suggests that a specific pool of ADAM10 acts on Notch in an endocytic compartment, rather than at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> surface.</p>

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression

K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human ether-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) channel shapes action potential firing in excitable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in tumors, where it modulates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1 interacted with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. This interaction was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 interaction. Although open hERG1 channels did not interact as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed channels, current flow through hERG1 channels was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in breast cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas metastasis of breast cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin interaction was disrupted. We conclude that the interaction of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 channels in cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s stimulated distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of tumor progression.</p>

Cell type transcriptome atlas for the planarian <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i>
<p>The transcriptome of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> dictates its unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type biology.

Stage-Specific Gene Profiling of Germinal Cells Helps Delineate the Mitosis/Meiosis Transition
<p>In flowering plants, germ lines are induced from somatic meristems within reproductive organs. Within anthers, germinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> initials first undergo several rounds of mitotic proliferation before synchronously entering meiosis. Our understanding of the progression and the molecular basis of this mitosis to meiosis transition is still limited. Taking advantage of the correlation between anther length and premeiotic germinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> development in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we studied the transcriptome dynamics of germinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s at three sequential stages, mitotic archesporial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, enlarging pollen mother <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s at the premeiosis interphase, and pollen mother <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s at the early prophase of meiosis, using laser microdissection-based expression profiling. Our analysis showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s undergoing the mitosis-meiosis switch exhibit robust transcriptional changes. The three stages are distinguished by the expression of genes encoding transcription factor subsets, meiotic chromosome recombination proteins, and distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, respectively. The transcription level of genes encoding protein turnover machinery was significantly higher in these three stages of germinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s than in mature pollen, parenchyma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, or seedlings. Our experimental results further indicate that many meiotic genes are not only transcribed, but also translated prior to meiosis. We suggest that the enlarging pollen mother <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s stage represents a crucial turning point from mitosis to meiosis for developing germinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s.</p>

SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE1 Links DNA Damage Response to Organ Regeneration
<p>In Arabidopsis, DNA damage-induced programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> death is limited to the meristematic stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> niche and its early descendants. The significance of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-type-specific programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> death is unclear. Here, we demonstrate in roots that it is the programmed destruction of the mitotically compromised stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> niche that triggers its regeneration, enabling growth recovery. In contrast to wild-type plants, <i>sog1</i> plants, which are defective in damage-induced programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> death, maintain the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> identities and stereotypical structure of the stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> niche after irradiation, but these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s fail to undergo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> division, terminating root growth.

SHORTROOT-Mediated Increase in Stomatal Density Has No Impact on Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>The coordinated positioning of veins, mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration and, therefore, for overall function. In monocot leaves, stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> files are positioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf veins, rather than directly above or below. This pattern suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s directly in contact with the vein or that specification is induced in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> files beyond the vein. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types around the vasculature in subepidermal layers of both root and shoots, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type identity determined by distance from the vein. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp <i>japonica</i>) <i>OsSHR2</i> gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle sheath <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s encircling the vein. In transgenic lines, which were generated using the orthologous <i>ZmSHR1</i> gene to avoid potential silencing of <i>OsSHR2</i>, stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> files were observed both in the normal position and in more distant positions from the vein. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot leaves, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> density. Collectively, these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may coordinate the positioning of veins and stomata in monocot leaves and that distinct mechanisms may operate in monocot and eudicot leaves to coordinate stomatal patterning with the development of underlying mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s.</p>

Pericardial Adipose Tissue Regulates Granulopoiesis, Fibrosis, and Cardiac Function After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The pericardial adipose tissue (AT) contains a high density of lymphoid clusters. It is unknown whether these clusters play a role in post–myocardial infarction (MI) inflammatory responses and cardiac outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lymphoid clusters were examined in epicardial AT of humans with or without coronary artery disease. Murine pericardial lymphoid clusters were visualized in mice subjected to coronary artery ligation. To study the relevance of pericardial clusters during inflammatory responses after MI, we surgically removed the pericardial AT and performed B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> depletion and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor blockade. Leukocytes in murine hearts, pericardial AT, spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bone marrow were quantified by flow cytometry. Cannabinoid receptor CB2 (CB2<sup>–/–</sup>) mice were used as a model for enhanced B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses. The effect of impaired dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> (DC) trafficking on pericardial AT inflammatory responses was tested in CCR7<sup>–/–</sup> mice subjected to MI. Cardiac fibrosis and ventricular function were assessed by histology and echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified larger B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> clusters in epicardial AT of human patients with coronary artery disease in comparison with controls without coronary artery disease. Infarcted mice also had larger pericardial clusters and 3-fold upregulated numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor–producing B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s within pericardial AT, but not spleen or lymph nodes. This was associated with higher DC and T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> counts in pericardial AT, which outnumbered DCs and T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in lymph nodes. Analysis of DC maturation markers, tracking experiments with fluorescently labeled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and use of CCR7-deficient mice suggested that activated DCs migrate from infarcts into pericardial AT via CCR7. B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> depletion or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor neutralization inhibited DC and T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> expansion within pericardial AT, and translated into reduced bone marrow granulopoiesis and cardiac neutrophil infiltration 3 days after MI. The relevance of the pericardial AT in mediating all these effects was confirmed by removal of pericardial AT and ex vivo coculture with pericardial AT and granulocyte progenitors. Finally, enhanced fibrosis and worsened ejection fraction in CB2<sup>–/–</sup> mice were limited by pericardial AT removal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings unveil a new mechanism by which the pericardial AT coordinates immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation, granulopoiesis, and outcome after MI.</p></sec>

We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory molecules from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion molecule very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s present in the MV and to determine which valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s were present in human rheumatic heart disease valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative molecules including arginase-1 and resistin-like molecule α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to increase the expression of vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion molecule–1. Conditionally deleting the vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion molecule-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart disease. We define key inflammatory molecules that drive MVD in this model, including Syk, TNF, interleukin-6, very late antigen–4, and vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion molecule–1.</p></sec>

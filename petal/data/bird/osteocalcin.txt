Mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate in response to traumatic bone injury in the zebrafish fin and skull
<p>Zebrafish have an unlimited capacity to regenerate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> after fin amputation. In this process, mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s dedifferentiate to osteogenic precursor cells and thus represent an important source of newly forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>. By contrast, differentiated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s do not appear to contribute to repair of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> injuries in mammals; rather, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s form anew from mesenchymal stem cells. This raises the question whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong> dedifferentiation is specific to appendage regeneration, a special feature of the lepidotrichia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> of the fish fin, or a process found more generally in fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>. Here, we show that dedifferentiation of mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s is not restricted to fin regeneration after amputation, but also occurs during repair of zebrafish fin fractures and skull injuries. In both models, mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s surrounding the injury downregulate the expression of differentiation markers, upregulate markers of the pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong> state and become proliferative. Making use of photoconvertible Kaede <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> as well as Cre-driven genetic fate mapping, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s migrate to the site of injury to replace damaged tissue. Our findings suggest a fundamental role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong> dedifferentiation in reparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> formation in fish and indicate that adult fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s display elevated cellular plasticity compared with mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>-forming cells.</p>

Genotype-Dependent and -Independent Calcium Signaling Dysregulation in Human Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> signaling may contribute to arrhythmias and adverse remodeling in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

CaMKII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> abundance was increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (<i>P</i><0.001). The CaMKII target pT17-phospholamban was 5.5-fold increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (<i>P</i>=0.01), as was autophosphorylated CaMKII (<i>P</i><0.01), suggestive of constitutive activation. Calcineurin (<i>PPP3CB</i>) mRNA was not increased, nor was <i>RCAN1</i> mRNA level, indicating a lack of calcineurin activation. Furthermore, myocyte enhancer factor 2 and nuclear factor of activated T cell transcription factor activity was not increased in HCM, suggesting that calcineurin pathway activation is not an upstream cause of increased CAMKII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> abundance or activation. <i>SERCA2A</i> mRNA transcript levels were reduced in HCM regardless of genotype, as was sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> ATPase 2/phospholamban <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> ratio (45% reduced; <i>P</i>=0.03). <sup>45</sup>Ca sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> ATPaseuptake assay showed reduced uptake velocity in HCM regardless of genotype (<i>P</i>=0.01).

Generation of specific inhibitors of SUMO-1– and SUMO-2/3–mediated protein-protein interactions using Affimer (Adhiron) technology
<p>Because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions underpin most biological processes, developing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the development of therapeutics is an important task. SUMOylation is the posttranslational covalent attachment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the SUMO family (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3), and it regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are recognized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) that facilitate noncovalent interactions with SUMO. We describe the use of the Affimer system of peptide display for the rapid isolation of synthetic binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that inhibit SUMO-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions mediated by SIMs both in vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s did not prevent SUMO conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific analysis of SUMO-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions. Furthermore, through structural analysis and molecular modeling, we explored the molecular mechanisms that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO-1–mediated interactions or interactions mediated by either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Not only will these reagents enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, but the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s could also be exploited to design or validate reagents or therapeutics that target other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions.</p>

Genomics and evolution of protein phosphatases
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases are the essential opposite to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases; together, these enzymes regulate all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation and most cellular processes. To better understand the global roles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation, we cataloged the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatome, composed of 189 known and predicted human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase genes. We also identified 79 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase pseudogenes or retrogenes, some of which may have residual function. We traced the origin and diversity of phosphatases by building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatomes for eight other eukaryotes, from the protist <i>Dictyostelium</i> to the sea urchin. We classified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases from all nine species into a hierarchy of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> folds, 21 families, and 178 subfamilies. We found that >80% of the 101 human subfamilies were conserved across the animal kingdom, but show substantial differences in evolution, including losses and expansions of individual subfamilies and changes in accessory domains. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases show similar evolutionary dynamics to those of kinases, with substantial losses in major model organisms. Sequence analysis predicts that 26 human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase domains are catalytically disabled and that this disability is mostly conserved across orthologs. This genomic and evolutionary perspective on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases provides a framework for global analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation throughout the animal kingdom.</p>

The G Protein <i>β</i>-Subunit, AGB1, Interacts with FERONIA in RALF1-Regulated Stomatal Movement
<p>Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are composed of Gα, G<i>β</i>, and Gγ subunits and function as molecular switches in signal transduction. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are one canonical Gα (GPA1), three extra-large Gα (XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3), one G<i>β</i> (AGB1), and three Gγ (AGG1, AGG2, and AGG3) subunits. To elucidate AGB1 molecular signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation using plasma membrane-enriched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s followed by mass spectrometry to identify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactors of AGB1. After eliminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s present in the control immunoprecipitation, commonly identified contaminants, and organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, a total of 103 candidate AGB1-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were confidently identified. We identified all of the G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> subunits except XLG1, receptor-like kinases, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, and 14-3-3-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, all of which may couple with or modulate G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling. We confirmed physical interaction between AGB1 and the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) family of polypeptides have been shown to be ligands of FER. In this study, we demonstrate that RALF1 regulates stomatal apertures and does so in a G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-dependent manner, inhibiting stomatal opening and promoting stomatal closure in Columbia but not in <i>agb1</i> mutants. We further show that AGGs and XLGs, but not GPA1, participate in RALF1-mediated stomatal signaling. Our results suggest that FER acts as a G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-coupled receptor for plant heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

EMC10 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Protein Complex Subunit 10) Is a Bone Marrow–Derived Angiogenic Growth Factor Promoting Tissue Repair After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow cell–based therapies after acute myocardial infarction (MI) have produced mostly neutral results. Treatment with specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow cell–derived secreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s may provide an alternative biological approach to improving tissue repair and heart function after MI. We recently performed a bioinformatic secretome analysis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow cells from patients with acute MI and discovered a poorly characterized secreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, EMC10 (endoplasmic reticulum membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complex subunit 10), showing activity in an angiogenic screen.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the angiogenic potential of EMC10 and its mouse homolog (Emc10) in cultured endothelial cells and infarcted heart explants.

Tandem Fluorescent Protein Timers for Noninvasive Relative Protein Lifetime Measurement in Plants
<p>Targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation is an important and pervasive regulatory mechanism in plants, required for perception and response to the environment as well as developmental signaling. Despite the significance of this process, relatively few studies have assessed plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in a quantitative fashion. Tandem fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> timers (tFTs) offer a powerful approach for the assessment of in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in distinct subcellular compartments of single or multiple cells. A tFT is a fusion of two different fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with distinct fluorophore maturation kinetics, which enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> age to be estimated from the ratio of fluorescence intensities of the two fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Here, we used short-lived auxin signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and model N-end rule (N-recognin) pathway reporters to demonstrate the utility of tFTs for studying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in living plant cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We present transient expression of tFTs as an efficient screen for relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> lifetime, useful for testing the effects of mutations and different genetic backgrounds on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> stability. This work demonstrates the potential for using stably expressed tFTs to study native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> dynamics with high temporal resolution in response to exogenous or endogenous stimuli.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed coat mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> profiles except for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s include a family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed coats, and their expression requires seed coat differentiation regulators. TBA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s to the seed coat epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Mouse models of telomere dysfunction phenocopy skeletal changes found in human age-related osteoporosis
<p>A major medical challenge in the elderly is osteoporosis and the high risk of fracture. Telomere dysfunction is a cause of cellular senescence and telomere shortening, which occurs with age in cells from most human tissues, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>. Telomere defects contribute to the pathogenesis of two progeroid disorders characterized by premature osteoporosis, Werner syndrome and dyskeratosis congenital. It is hypothesized that telomere shortening contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> aging. We evaluated the skeletal phenotypes of mice with disrupted telomere maintenance mechanisms as models for human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> aging, including mutants in Werner helicase (<i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i>), telomerase (<i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i>) and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> double mutants. Compared with young wild-type (WT) mice, micro-computerized tomography analysis revealed that young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have decreased trabecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, as well as increased trabecular spacing. In cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>, young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have increased cortical thinning, and increased porosity relative to age-matched WT mice. These trabecular and cortical changes were accelerated with age in <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice compared with older WT mice. Histological quantification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s in aged mice showed a similar number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s in all genotypes; however, significant decreases in osteoid, mineralization surface, mineral apposition rate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> formation rate in older <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong> dysfunction is a prominent feature of precocious aging in these mice. Except in the <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i> single mutant, osteoclast number did not increase in any genotype. Significant alterations in mechanical parameters (structure model index, degree of anistrophy and moment of inertia) of the <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> femurs compared with WT mice were also observed. Young <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice had a statistically significant increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>-marrow fat content compared with young WT mice, which remained elevated in aged double mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants recapitulate the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> aging phenotype and are useful models for studying age-related osteoporosis.</p>

After 12 weeks, we harvested the heart and evaluated the aortic valve tissue using immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that nitric oxide depletion in human valvular endothelial cells activates NF-κB in human VICs. Consequently, the NF-κB promotes DPP-4 expression, which then induces the osteogenic differentiation of VICs by limiting autocrine insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling. The inhibition of DPP-4 enzymatic activity blocked the osteogenic changes in VICs in vitro and reduced the aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication in vivo in a mouse model. Sitagliptin administration in a rabbit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ic aortic valve disease model led to significant improvements in the rate of change in aortic valve area, transaortic peak velocity, and maximal and mean pressure gradients over 12 weeks.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain amino acids or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and 131 to bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Lipid peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were identified in vivo, including three key nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and 18 bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

Increased activity of TNAP compensates for reduced adenosine production and promotes ectopic calcification in the genetic disease ACDC
<p>ACDC (arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication due to deficiency of CD73) is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from loss-of-function mutations in <i>NT5E</i>, which encodes CD73, a 5′-ectonucleotidase that converts extracellular adenosine monophosphate to adenosine. ACDC patients display progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication of lower extremity arteries, causing limb ischemia. Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), which converts pyrophosphate (PPi) to inorganic phosphate (Pi), and extracellular purine metabolism play important roles in other inherited forms of vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication. Compared to cells from healthy subjects, induced pluripotent stem cell–derived mesenchymal stromal cells (iMSCs) from ACDC patients displayed accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication and increased TNAP activity when cultured under conditions that promote osteogenesis. TNAP activity generated adenosine in iMSCs derived from ACDC patients but not in iMSCs from control subjects, which have CD73. In response to osteogenic stimulation, ACDC patient–derived iMSCs had decreased amounts of the TNAP substrate PPi, an inhibitor of extracellular matrix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication, and exhibited increased activation of AKT, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and the 70-kDa ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> S6 kinase (p70S6K), a pathway that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication. In vivo, teratomas derived from ACDC patient cells showed extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication and increased TNAP activity. Treating mice bearing these teratomas with an A2b adenosine receptor agonist, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, or the bisphosphonate etidronate reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication. These results show that an increase of TNAP activity in ACDC contributes to ectopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication by disrupting the extracellular balance of PPi and Pi and identify potential therapeutic targets for ACDC.</p>

Saltational evolution of the heterotrimeric G protein signaling mechanisms in the plant kingdom
<p>Signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s evolved diverse interactions to provide specificity for distinct stimuli. Signaling complexity in the G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> (heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate–binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>) network was achieved in animals through subunit duplication and incremental evolution. By combining comprehensive and quantitative phenotypic profiles of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> evolution informatics, we found that plant heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> machinery evolved by a saltational (jumping) process. Sequence similarity scores mapped onto tertiary structures, and biochemical validation showed that the extra-large Gα (XLG) subunit evolved extensively in the charophycean algae (an aquatic green plant) by gene duplication and gene fusion. In terrestrial plants, further evolution uncoupled XLG from its negative regulator, regulator of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling, but preserved an α-helix region that enables interaction with its partner Gβγ. The ancestral gene evolved slowly due to the molecular constraints imposed by the need for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> to maintain interactions with various partners, whereas the genes encoding XLG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s evolved rapidly to produce three highly divergent members. Analysis of <i>A. thaliana</i> mutants indicated that these Gα and XLG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s all function with Gβγ and evolved to operate both independently and cooperatively. The XLG-Gβγ machinery specialized in environmental stress responses, whereas the canonical Gα-Gβγ retained developmental roles. Some developmental processes, such as shoot development, involve both Gα and XLG acting cooperatively or antagonistically. These extensive and rapid evolutionary changes in XLG structure compared to those of the canonical Gα subunit contrast with the accepted notion of how pathway diversification occurs through gene duplication with subsequent incremental coevolution of residues among interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Multisite phosphorylation by MAPK
<p>Reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in signal transduction networks. Phosphorylation alters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function by regulating enzymatic activity, stability, cellular localization, or binding partners. Over three-quarters of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s may be phosphorylated, with many targeted at multiple sites. Such multisite phosphorylation substantially increases the scope for modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function—a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> with <i>n</i> phosphorylation sites has the potential to exist in 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> distinct phosphorylation states, each of which could, in theory, display modified functionality. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s can be substrates for several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases, thereby integrating distinct signals to provide a coherent biological response. However, they can also be phosphorylated at multiple sites by a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase to promote a specific functional output that can be reversed by dephosphorylation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases. On page 233 of this issue, Mylona <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal an unexpected role for multisite phosphorylation, whereby a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase progressively phosphorylates sites on a transcription factor to promote and then subsequently limit its activity independently of dephosphorylation.</p>

Direct Proteomic Quantification of the Secretome of Activated Immune Cells
<sec><title>Tracking Secreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s secreted by cells provide a flow of information within tissues and are thus of particular interest. However, systematic detection of secreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s is tricky because they tend to be present in small amounts within complex mixtures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s where other components are very abundant. <bold>Meissner <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 475) developed a method for screening the secreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s from cultured mouse macrophages in response to cues that cause inflammation. The amount of contaminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s was reduced by culturing the cells without added serum and then sensitive mass spectrometry techniques were used to detect and quantify secretion of nearly 800 different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Secretion was compared from cells lacking the signaling adaptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s MyD88 or TRIF, or both. Secretion of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were regulated redundantly and were secreted without one of the adaptors, but others required both signals for release. Some anti-inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were released at later times in response to synergistic signals from both adaptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, perhaps as a fail-safe mechanism to prevent excessive inflammation.</p></sec>

Stable Accumulation of Photosystem II Requires ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) of the Light Harvesting-Like Family
<p>The cellular functions of two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) one-helix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, OHP1 and OHP2 (also named LIGHT-HARVESTING-LIKE2 [LIL2] and LIL6, respectively, because they have sequence similarity to light-harvesting chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s), remain unclear. Tagged null mutants of <i>OHP1</i> and <i>OHP2</i> (<i>ohp1</i> and <i>ohp2</i>) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s revealed that <i>ohp1</i> deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic <i>ohp1</i> plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid membranes, where it formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complexes with both OHP2 and High Chlorophyll Fluorescence244 (HCF244). We also found PSII core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other plant-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly. OHP1 interacted directly with HCF244 in the complex. Therefore, OHP1 and HCF244 play important roles in the stable accumulation of PSII.</p>

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts
<p>Chloroplasts import many pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that can be classified based on their physicochemical properties. The cleavable N-terminal transit peptide (TP) of chloroplast pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s contains all the information required for import into chloroplasts through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of whether and how the physicochemical properties of pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s affect TP-mediated import into chloroplasts has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient translocation through the chloroplast envelope membranes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s containing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s prone to aggregation. By contrast, the translocation of soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s through the chloroplast envelope membranes is less dependent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation into chloroplasts; instead, these mutant TPs led to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> mistargeting to the chloroplast envelope membranes or nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> aggregation during import into chloroplasts. The mistargeting of TMD-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation is compromised. We propose that the physicochemical properties of chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation through the chloroplast envelope, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient translocation of TMD-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Calcium Pumps and Interacting BON1 Protein Modulate Calcium Signature, Stomatal Closure, and Plant Immunity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> signaling is essential for environmental responses including immune responses. Here, we provide evidence that the evolutionarily conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> BONZAI1 (BON1) functions together with autoinhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> ATPase10 (ACA10) and ACA8 to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> signals in Arabidopsis. BON1 is a plasma membrane localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> that negatively regulates the expression of immune receptor genes and positively regulates stomatal closure. We found that BON1 interacts with the autoinhibitory domains of ACA10 and ACA8, and the <i>aca10</i> loss-of-function (LOF) mutants have an autoimmune phenotype similar to that of the <i>bon1</i> LOF mutants. Genetic evidences indicate that BON1 positively regulates the activities of ACA10 and ACA8. Consistent with this idea, the steady level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> concentration is increased in both <i>aca10</i> and <i>bon1</i> mutants. Most strikingly, cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> oscillation imposed by external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> treatment was altered in <i>aca10</i>, <i>aca8</i>, and <i>bon1</i> mutants in guard cells. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>- and pathogen-induced stomatal closure was compromised in the <i>aca10</i> and <i>bon1</i> mutants. Taken together, this study indicates that ACA10/8 and BON1 physically interact on plasma membrane and function in the generation of cytosol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> signatures that are critical for stomatal movement and impact plant immunity.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> family, which also includes the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction, and integration of interacting partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are much larger than the bacterial BcsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, prompting the suggestion that these plant-specific regions are important for interactions between CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and for conferring CESA class specificity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and hence what determines the specificity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class specificity extends throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site specificity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib.

Interleukin-10 Inhibits Bone Marrow Fibroblast Progenitor Cell–Mediated Cardiac Fibrosis in Pressure-Overloaded Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) play a critical role in cardiac fibrosis; however, their origin in the diseased heart remains unclear, warranting further investigation. Recent studies suggest the contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow fibroblast progenitor cells (BM-FPCs) in pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis. We have previously shown that interleukin-10 (IL10) suppresses pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis; however, the role of IL10 in inhibition of BM-FPC–mediated cardiac fibrosis is not known. We hypothesized that IL10 inhibits pressure overload–induced homing of BM-FPCs to the heart and their transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts and thus attenuates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pressure overload was induced in wild-type (WT) and IL10 knockout (IL10KO) mice by transverse aortic constriction. To determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow origin, chimeric mice were created with enhanced green fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> WT mice marrow to the IL10KO mice. For mechanistic studies, FPCs were isolated from mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Pressure overload enhanced BM-FPC mobilization and homing in IL10KO mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, WT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow (from enhanced green fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> mice) transplantation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow–depleted IL10KO mice (IL10KO chimeric mice) reduced transverse aortic constriction–induced BM-FPC mobilization compared with IL10KO mice. Green fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> costaining with α-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1α in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric mice suggests that myofibroblasts were derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow after transverse aortic constriction. Finally, WT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow transplantation in IL10KO mice inhibited transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac fibrosis and improved heart function. At the molecular level, IL10 treatment significantly inhibited transforming growth factor-β–induced transdifferentiation and fibrotic signaling in WT BM-FPCs in vitro. Furthermore, fibrosis-associated microRNA (miRNA) expression was highly upregulated in IL10KO-FPCs compared with WT-FPCs. Polymerase chain reaction–based selective miRNA analysis revealed that transforming growth factor-β–induced enhanced expression of fibrosis-associated miRNAs (miRNA-21, -145, and -208) was significantly inhibited by IL10. Restoration of miRNA-21 levels suppressed the IL10 effects on transforming growth factor-β–induced fibrotic signaling in BM-FPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that IL10 inhibits BM-FPC homing and transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in pressure-overloaded myocardium.

Proximity biotinylation identifies a set of conformation-specific interactions between Merlin and cell junction proteins
<p>Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited, neoplastic disease associated with schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas and that is caused by inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene <i>NF2</i>. The <i>NF2</i> gene product, Merlin, has no intrinsic catalytic activity; its tumor suppressor function is mediated through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with which it interacts. We used proximity biotinylation followed by mass spectrometry and direct binding assays to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that associated with wild-type and various mutant forms of Merlin in immortalized Schwann cells. We defined a set of 52 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in close proximity to wild-type Merlin. Most of the Merlin-proximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were components of cell junctional signaling complexes, suggesting that additional potential interaction partners may exist in adherens junctions, tight junctions, and focal adhesions. With mutant forms of Merlin that cannot bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) or that constitutively adopt a closed conformation, we confirmed a critical role for PIP<sub>2</sub> binding in Merlin function and identified a large cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that specifically interacted with Merlin in the closed conformation. Among these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, we identified a previously unreported Merlin-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, apoptosis-stimulated p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 2 (ASPP2, also called Tp53bp2), that bound to closed-conformation Merlin predominately through the FERM domain. Our results demonstrate that Merlin is a component of cell junctional mechanosensing complexes and defines a specific set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s through which it acts.</p>

RGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are classified into four subfamilies (R4, R7, RZ, and R12) and function as negative regulators of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling by inactivating Gα subunits. We found that the R12 subfamily members RGS10 and RGS14 had lower activity than most R4 subfamily members toward the G<sub>i</sub> subfamily member Gα<sub>o</sub>. Using structure-based energy calculations with multiple Gα-RGS complexes, we identified R12-specific residues in positions that are predicted to determine the divergent activity of this subfamily. This analysis predicted that these residues, which we call “disruptor residues,” interact with the Gα helical domain. We engineered the R12 disruptor residues into the RGS domains of the high-activity R4 subfamily and found that these altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s exhibited reduced activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Reciprocally, replacing the putative disruptor residues in RGS18 (a member of the R4 subfamily that exhibited low activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>) with the corresponding residues from a high-activity R4 subfamily RGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> increased its activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Furthermore, the high activity of the R4 subfamily toward Gα<sub>o</sub> was independent of the residues in the homologous positions to the R12 subfamily and RGS18 disruptor residues. Thus, our results suggest that the identified RGS disruptor residues function as negative design elements that attenuate RGS activity for specific Gα <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Aurora B opposes PP1 function in mitosis by phosphorylating the conserved PP1-binding RVxF motif in PP1 regulatory proteins
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a highly conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase that performs most of the serine- and threonine-dephosphorylation reactions in eukaryotes and opposes the actions of a diverse set of serine and threonine (Ser-Thr) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases. PP1 gains substrate specificity through binding to a large number (>200) of regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that control PP1 localization, activity, and interactions with substrates. PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF binding motif that is present in many of these regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes. We showed that a subset of the RVxF binding motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable amino acid (RV[S/T]F), was phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily governed by the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites maintained the phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis by disrupting the assembly of PP1 holoenzymes. We generated an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s (KNL1, CDCA2, and RIF1) and multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that could potentially act as PP1 binding partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1, and ELYS) governed by this mechanism. Together, these data suggest a general regulatory mechanism by which the coordinated activities of Aurora B and PP1 control mitotic progression.</p>

C-reactive protein promotes bone destruction in human myeloma through the CD32–p38 MAPK–Twist axis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> destruction is a hallmark of myeloma and affects 80% of patients. Myeloma cells promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> destruction by activating osteoclasts. In investigating the underlying mechanism, we found that C-reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> (CRP), a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> secreted in increased amounts by hepatocytes in response to myeloma-derived cytokines, activated myeloma cells to promote osteoclastogenesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> destruction in vivo. In mice bearing human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> grafts and injected with multiple myeloma cells, CRP bound to surface CD32 (also known as FcγRII) on myeloma cells, which activated a pathway mediated by the kinase p38 MAPK and the transcription factor Twist that enhanced the cells’ secretion of osteolytic cytokines. Furthermore, analysis of clinical samples from newly diagnosed myeloma patients revealed a positive correlation between the amount of serum CRP and the number of osteolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> lesions. These findings establish a mechanism by which myeloma cells are activated to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> destruction and suggest that CRP may be targeted to prevent or treat myeloma-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> disease in patients.</p>

Protein kinase N3 promotes bone resorption by osteoclasts in response to Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling
<p>Cytoskeletal reorganization in osteoclasts to form actin rings is necessary for these cells to attach to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> and resorb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> matrices. We delineated the pathway through which Wnt5a signaling through receptor tyrosine kinase–like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2) promoted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>-resorbing activity of osteoclasts. Wnt5a binding to Ror2 stimulated Rho, a small GTPase involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. Subsequently, the Rho effector kinase Pkn3 bound to and enhanced the activity of c-Src, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is critical for actin ring formation. Mice with an osteoclast-specific deficiency in <i>Ror2</i> (<i>Ror2</i><sup>ΔOcl/ΔOcl</sup>) had increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> mass. Osteoclasts derived from these mice exhibited impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> resorption and actin ring formation, defects that were rescued by overexpression of constitutively active RhoA. These osteoclasts also exhibited reduced interaction between c-Src and Pkn3 and reduced c-Src kinase activity. Similar to <i>Ror2</i><sup>ΔOcl/ΔOcl</sup> mice, mice with a global deficiency of <i>Pkn3</i> (<i>Pkn3</i><sup>−/−</sup>) had increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> mass. The proline-rich region and kinase domain of Pkn3 were required to restore the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>-resorbing activity of osteoclasts derived from <i>Pkn3</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice. Thus, Pkn3 promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> resorption downstream of Wnt5a-Ror2-Rho signaling, and this pathway may be a therapeutic target for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontal disease.</p>

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart pumps blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This pumping function is achieved through synchronous contraction of billions of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly couple external electrical impulses to the triggering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> ion release from intracellular stores and subsequent activation of force-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, a process termed excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> channel with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> release during E-C coupling. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C coupling, reduced pumping capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and function as a transcription factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addition to its “day job” as a structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

Random heteropolymers preserve protein function in foreign environments
<p>The successful incorporation of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s into synthetic polymers could lead to a new class of materials with functions found only in living systems. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s rarely function under the conditions suitable for polymer processing. On the basis of an analysis of trends in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> sequences and characteristic chemical patterns on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> surfaces, we designed four-monomer random heteropolymers to mimic intrinsically disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> solubilization and stabilization in non-native environments. The heteropolymers, with optimized composition and statistical monomer distribution, enable cell-free synthesis of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with proper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> folding for transport and enzyme-containing plastics for toxin bioremediation. Controlling the statistical monomer distribution in a heteropolymer, rather than the specific monomer sequence, affords a new strategy to interface with biological systems for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-based biomaterials.</p>

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s fold into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo designed mini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, 1000 natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable designed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and stability in uncharted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> space. Iteration between design and experiment increased the design success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s unlike those found in nature for topologies where design was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as designs became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> design into a data-driven science.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation
<p>Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is coproduced with ethylene in plant cells and is primarily enzymatically detoxified by the mitochondrial β-CYANOALANINE SYNTHASE (CAS-C1). Permanent or transient depletion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alterations in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> content, identifying 451 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that are absent or less abundant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that are only present or more abundant in <i>cas-c1</i>. Gene ontology classification of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s identified proteomic changes that explain the root hairless phenotype and the altered immune response observed in the <i>cas-c1</i> mutant. The mechanism of action of cyanide as a signaling molecule was addressed using two proteomic approaches aimed at identifying the <i>S-</i>cyanylation of Cys as a posttranslational modification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Both the 2-imino-thiazolidine chemical method and the direct untargeted analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified a set of 163 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s susceptible to <i>S-</i>cyanylation that included SEDOHEPTULOSE 1,7-BISPHOSPHATASE (SBPase), the PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE 20-3 (CYP20-3), and ENOLASE2 (ENO2). In vitro analysis of these enzymes showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation of SBPase Cys<sup>74</sup>, CYP20-3 Cys<sup>259</sup>, and ENO2 Cys<sup>346</sup> residues affected their enzymatic activity. Gene Ontology classification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction cluster analysis showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation is involved in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, and the Calvin and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met cycles.</p>

Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> mass under increased mechanical loads. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> response to applied load decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>, the tissue most impacted by age-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> tibial loading model to characterize the load-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied load on tibial morphology and stiffness were determined using microcomputed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied loading. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied load produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the loaded tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. Load-induced tibial stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following loading, which corresponded to increased <i>in vivo</i> tibial stiffness. Stiffness in the loaded tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting load-induced changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> functional stiffness.</p>

The role of light in mediating the effects of ocean acidification on coral calcification
<p>We tested the effect of light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication and survival of <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i> recruits settled from larvae released in southern Taiwan. In March 2011, recruits were incubated at 31, 41, 70, 122 and 226 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> under ambient (493 μatm) and high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> (878 μatm). After 5 days, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated as the number of living recruits. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication was affected by the interaction of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> with light, and at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> the response to light intensity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, the effect of light on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication differed from that observed at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, with the result that there were large differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication between 493 μatm and 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> at intermediate light intensities (<i>ca</i>. 70 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), but similar rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication at the highest and lowest light intensities. Survivorship was affected by light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, and was highest at 122 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> in both <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> treatments, but was unrelated to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication of <i>P. damicornis</i> recruits at intermediate light intensities, but not at lower or higher intensities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory effects of high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication at intermediate light intensities that disappear at both higher and lower light intensities.</p>

Hyperacetylation of mitochondrial malate-aspartate shuttle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s impaired the transport and oxidation of cytosolic NADH in the mitochondria, resulting in altered cytosolic redox state and energy deficiency. Furthermore, acetylation of oligomycin-sensitive conferring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> at lysine-70 in adenosine triphosphate synthase complex promoted its interaction with cyclophilin D, and sensitized the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore.

Modulating Protein Stability to Switch Toxic Protein Function On and Off in Living Cells
<p>Toxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are prime targets for molecular farming (the generation of pharmacologically active or biotechnologically usable compounds in plants) and are also efficient tools for targeted cell ablation in genetics, developmental biology, and biotechnology. However, achieving conditional activity of cytotoxins and maintaining the toxin-expressing plants as stably transformed lines remain challenging. Here, we produce a switchable version of the highly cytotoxic bacterial RNase barnase by fusing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> to a portable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation cassette, the low-temperature degron cassette. This method allows conditional genetics based on conditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation via the N-end rule or N-degron pathway and has been used to vice versa accumulate and/or deplete a diverse variety of highly active, unstable or stable target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in different living multicellular organisms and cell systems. Moreover, we expressed the barnase fusion under control of the trichome-specific <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> promoter. This enabled efficient temperature-dependent control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> accumulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf hairs (trichomes). By tuning the levels of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, we were able to control the fate of trichomes in vivo. The on-demand formation of trichomes through manipulating the balance between stabilization and destabilization of barnase provides proof of concept for a robust and powerful tool for conditional switchable cell arrest. We present this tool as a potential strategy for the manufacture and accumulation of cytotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and toxic high-value products in plants or for conditional genetic cell ablation.</p>

CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED Supports Translation under Stress and Interacts with the Ribosomal 30S Subunit
<p>Chloroplast ribosomes, which originated from cyanobacteria, comprise a large subunit (50S) and a small subunit (30S) containing ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and various ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Genes for many chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with auxiliary roles in ribosome biogenesis or functioning, reside in the nucleus. Here, we identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED (CRASS), a member of the latter class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, based on the tight coexpression of its mRNA with transcripts for nucleus-encoded chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. CRASS was acquired during the evolution of embryophytes and is localized to the chloroplast stroma. Loss of CRASS results in minor defects in development, photosynthetic efficiency, and chloroplast translation activity under controlled growth conditions, but these phenotypes are greatly exacerbated under stress conditions induced by the translational inhibitors lincomycin and chloramphenicol or by cold treatment. The CRASS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> comigrates with chloroplast ribosomal particles and coimmunoprecipitates with the 16S rRNA and several chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, particularly the plastid ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s of the 30S subunit (PRPS1 and PRPS5). The association of CRASS with PRPS1 and PRPS5 is independent of rRNA and is not detectable in yeast two-hybrid experiments, implying that either CRASS interacts indirectly with PRPS1 and PRPS5 via another component of the small ribosomal subunit or that it recognizes structural features of the multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>/rRNA particle. CRASS plays a role in the biogenesis and/or stability of the chloroplast ribosome that becomes critical under certain stressful conditions when ribosomal activity is compromised.</p>

<i>Medicago</i> Plants Control Nodulation by Regulating Proteolysis of the Receptor-Like Kinase DMI2
<p>Plants use receptor-like kinases to monitor environmental changes and transduce signals into plant cells. The <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (hereafter <i>M</i>. <i>truncatula</i>) DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS2 (DMI2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> functions as a coreceptor of rhizobial signals to initiate nodule development and rhizobial infection during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, but the mechanisms regulating DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> level and folding are still unknown. Here, we report that DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> abundance changes during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. DMI2 accumulates in the nodules and is induced by rhizobia treatment through a posttranscriptional process. However, DMI2 induction is independent of the perception of Nod factor, a group of lipochitooligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia. The stability of the DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> is controlled by the proteasome pathway: in rhizobia-free environments, DMI2 is degraded by the proteasome, but during rhizobial infection, DMI2 is protected from the proteasome, resulting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> accumulation. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor-promoted accumulation of DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> in <i>Medicago</i> roots induces the expression of two early nodulation marker genes, supporting the hypothesis that DMI2 accumulation activates downstream symbiosis signaling. The extracellular region of DMI2 contains two malectin-like domains (MLDs) and a leucine-rich repeat. When conserved amino acids in the MLDs are mutated, DMI2 fails to restore nodule development in <i>dmi2</i> mutants, and point-mutated MLD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are degraded constitutively, suggesting that the MLD may be vital for the accumulation of DMI2. Our findings suggest that legumes control nodule development through modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> level of DMI2, revealing a layer of regulation in the interaction between plants and rhizobia in nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.</p>

PROHIBITIN3 Forms Complexes with ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 to Regulate Stress-Induced Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a major defense signal in plants. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the chloroplast-localized isochorismate pathway is the main source of SA biosynthesis during abiotic stress or pathogen infections. In the first step of the pathway, the enzyme ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 (ICS1) converts chorismate to isochorismate. An unknown enzyme subsequently converts isochorismate to SA. Here, we show that ICS1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels increase during UV-C stress. To identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that may play roles in SA production by regulating ICS1, we analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that coimmunoprecipitated with ICS1 via mass spectrometry. The ICS1 complexes contained a large number of peptides from the PROHIBITIN (PHB) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> family, with PHB3 the most abundant. PHB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s have diverse biological functions that include acting as scaffolds for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complex formation and stabilization. PHB3 was reported previously to localize to mitochondria. Using fractionation, protease protection, and live imaging, we show that PHB3 also localizes to chloroplasts, where ICS1 resides. Notably, loss of PHB3 function led to decreased ICS1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels in response to UV-C stress. However, <i>ICS1</i> transcript levels remain unchanged, indicating that ICS1 is regulated posttranscriptionally. The <i>phb3</i> mutant displayed reduced levels of SA, the SA-regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> PR1, and hypersensitive cell death in response to UV-C and avirulent strains of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and, correspondingly, supported increased growth of <i>P. syringae</i>. The expression of a <i>PHB3</i> transgene in the <i>phb3</i> mutant complemented all of these phenotypes. We suggest a model in which the formation of PHB3-ICS1 complexes stabilizes ICS1 to promote SA production in response to stress.</p>

The Prenylated Rab GTPase Receptor PRA1.F4 Contributes to Protein Exit from the Golgi Apparatus
<p>Prenylated Rab acceptor1 (PRA1) functions in the recruitment of prenylated Rab <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s to their cognate organelles. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains a large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s belonging to the AtPRA1 family. However, their physiological roles remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the physiological role of AtPRA1.F4, a member of the AtPRA1 family. A T-DNA insertion knockdown mutant of <i>AtPRA1.F4</i>, <i>atpra1.f4</i>, was smaller in stature than parent plants and possessed shorter roots, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing HA:AtPRA1.F4 showed enhanced development of secondary roots and root hairs. However, both overexpression and knockdown plants exhibited increased sensitivity to high-salt stress, lower vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and plasma membrane ATPase activities, lower and higher pH in the vacuole and apoplast, respectively, and highly vesiculated Golgi apparatus. HA:AtPRA1.F4 localized to the Golgi apparatus and assembled into high-molecular-weight complexes. <i>atpra1.f4</i> plants displayed a defect in vacuolar trafficking, which was complemented by low but not high levels of <i>HA</i>:<i>AtPRA1.F4</i>. Overexpression of HA:AtPRA1.F4 also inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> trafficking at the Golgi apparatus, albeit differentially depending on the final destination or type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>: trafficking of vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, plasma membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, and trans-Golgi network (TGN)-localized SYP61 was strongly inhibited; trafficking of TGN-localized SYP51 was slightly inhibited; and trafficking of secretory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and TGN-localized SYP41 was negligibly or not significantly inhibited. Based on these results, we propose that Golgi-localized AtPRA1.F4 is involved in the exit of many but not all types of post-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s from the Golgi apparatus. Additionally, an appropriate level of AtPRA1.F4 is crucial for its function at the Golgi apparatus.</p>

Pipeline to Identify Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoproteins
<p>Intrinsically disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s (IDPs) are functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure. The study of IDPs is a rapidly growing area as the crucial biological functions of more of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are uncovered. In plants, IDPs are implicated in plant stress responses, signaling, and regulatory processes. A superfamily of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, the hydroxyproline-rich glyco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s (HRGPs), have characteristic features of IDPs. Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> back<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>s are rich in the disordering amino acid proline, they contain repeated sequence motifs and extensive posttranslational modifications (glycosylation), and they have been implicated in many biological functions. HRGPs are evolutionarily ancient, having been isolated from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-rich walls of chlorophyte algae to the cellulose-rich walls of embryophytes. Examination of HRGPs in a range of plant species should provide valuable insights into how they have evolved. Commonly divided into the arabinogalactan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, extensins, and proline-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, in reality, a continuum of structures exists within this diverse and heterogenous superfamily. An inability to accurately classify HRGPs leads to inconsistent gene ontologies limiting the identification of HRGP classes in existing and emerging omics data sets. We present a novel and robust motif and amino acid bias (MAAB) bioinformatics pipeline to classify HRGPs into 23 descriptive subclasses. Validation of MAAB was achieved using available genomic resources and then applied to the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (<ext-link>www.onekp.com</ext-link>) data set. Significant improvement in the detection of HRGPs using multiple-<i>k-</i>mer transcriptome assembly methodology was observed. The MAAB pipeline is readily adaptable and can be modified to optimize the recovery of IDPs from other organisms.</p>

Activation of Mitochondrial Protein Phosphatase SLP2 by MIA40 Regulates Seed Germination
<p>Reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation catalyzed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases and phosphatases represents the most prolific and well-characterized posttranslational modification known. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>Shewanella</i>-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase 2 (AtSLP2) is a bona fide Ser/Thr <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase that is targeted to the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) where it interacts with the mitochondrial oxidoreductase import and assembly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 40 (AtMIA40), forming a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complex. Interaction with AtMIA40 is necessary for the phosphatase activity of AtSLP2 and is dependent on the formation of disulfide bridges on AtSLP2. Furthermore, by utilizing <i>atslp2</i> null mutant, AtSLP2 complemented and AtSLP2 overexpressing plants, we identify a function for the AtSLP2-AtMIA40 complex in negatively regulating gibberellic acid-related processes during seed germination. Results presented here characterize a mitochondrial IMS-localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase identified in photosynthetic eukaryotes as well as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase target of the highly conserved eukaryotic MIA40 IMS oxidoreductase.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

The distribution of heat in bone during radiofrequency ablation of an <i>ex vivo</i> bovine model of osteoid osteoma
<p>Osteoid osteoma is treated primarily by radiofrequency   (RF) ablation. However, there is little information about the distribution   of heat in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> during the procedure and its safety. We constructed   a model of osteoid osteoma to assess the distribution of heat in   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> and to define the margins of safety for ablation. Cavities   were drilled in cadaver bovine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>s and filled with a liver homogenate   to simulate the tumour matrix. Temperature-sensing probes were placed   in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> in a radial fashion away from the cavities. RF ablation   was performed 107 times in tumours < 10 mm in diameter (72 of   which were in cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>, 35 in cancellous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>), and 41 times   in cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> with models > 10 mm in diameter. Significantly   higher temperatures were found in cancellous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> than in cortical   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> (p < 0.05). For lesions up to 10 mm in diameter, in both   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> types, the temperature varied directly with the size of the   tumour (p < 0.05), and inversely with the distance from it. Tumours   of > 10 mm in diameter showed a trend similar to those of smaller   lesions. No temperature rise was seen beyond 12 mm from the edge   of a cortical tumour of any size. Formulae were developed to predict   the expected temperature in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> during ablation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:677–83</p>

Cell-wide analysis of protein thermal unfolding reveals determinants of thermostability

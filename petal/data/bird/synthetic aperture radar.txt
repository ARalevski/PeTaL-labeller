Radar evidence of subglacial liquid water on Mars
<p>The presence of liquid water at the base of the martian polar caps has long been suspected but not observed. We surveyed the Planum Australe region using the MARSIS (Mars Advanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radar</span></strong> for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) instrument, a low-frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radar</span></strong> on the Mars Express spacecraft. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radar</span></strong> profiles collected between May 2012 and December 2015 contain evidence of liquid water trapped below the ice of the South Polar Layered Deposits. Anomalously bright subsurface reflections are evident within a well-defined, 20-kilometer-wide zone centered at 193°E, 81°S, which is surrounded by much less reflective areas. Quantitative analysis of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radar</span></strong> signals shows that this bright feature has high relative dielectric permittivity (>15), matching that of water-bearing materials. We interpret this feature as a stable body of liquid water on Mars.</p>

The rise, collapse, and compaction of Mt. Mantap from the 3 September 2017 North Korean nuclear test
<p>Surveillance of clandestine nuclear tests relies on a global seismic network, but the potential of spaceborne monitoring has been underexploited. We used satellite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radar</span></strong> imagery to determine the complete surface displacement field of up to 3.5 meters of divergent horizontal motion with 0.5 meters of subsidence associated with North Korea’s largest underground nuclear test. Combining insight from geodetic and seismological remote sensing, we found that the aftermath of the initial explosive deformation involved subsidence associated with subsurface collapse and aseismic compaction of the damaged rocks of the test site. The explosive yield from the nuclear detonation with best-fitting source parameters for 450-meter depth was 191 kilotonnes of TNT equivalent. Our results demonstrate the capability of spaceborne remote sensing to help characterize large underground nuclear tests.</p>

Complex multifault rupture during the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.8 Kaikōura earthquake, New Zealand
<p>On 14 November 2016, northeastern South Island of New Zealand was struck by a major moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 7.8 earthquake. Field observations, in conjunction with interferometric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthetic apertur</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radar</span></strong>, Global Positioning System, and seismology data, reveal this to be one of the most complex earthquakes ever recorded. The rupture propagated northward for more than 170 kilometers along both mapped and unmapped faults before continuing offshore at the island’s northeastern extent. Geodetic and field observations reveal surface ruptures along at least 12 major faults, including possible slip along the southern Hikurangi subduction interface; extensive uplift along much of the coastline; and widespread anelastic deformation, including the ~8-meter uplift of a fault-bounded block. This complex earthquake defies many conventional assumptions about the degree to which earthquake ruptures are controlled by fault segmentation and should motivate reevaluation of these issues in seismic hazard models.</p>

Surface uplift and time-dependent seismic hazard due to fluid injection in eastern Texas
<p>Observations that unequivocally link seismicity and wastewater injection are scarce. Here we show that wastewater injection in eastern Texas causes uplift, detectable in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radar</span></strong> interferometric data up to >8 kilometers from the wells. Using measurements of uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore pressure. We infer that an increase of >1 megapascal in pore pressure in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8–moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined, owing to diffusion of pore pressure from earlier periods with higher injection rates. Induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining formations prevent pore pressure from propagating into crystalline basement rocks.</p>

Heterobiaryl synthesis by contractive C–C coupling via P(V) intermediates
<p>Heterobiaryls composed of pyridine and diazine rings are key components of pharmaceuticals and are often central to pharmacological function. We present an alternative approach to metal-catalyzed cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing to make heterobiaryls using contractive phosphorus C–C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ings, also termed phosphorus ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing reactions. The process starts by regioselective phosphorus substitution of the C–H bonds para to nitrogen in two successive heterocycles; ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing is then triggered via acidic alcohol solutions to form the heterobiaryl bond. Mechanistic studies imply that ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing is an asynchronous process involving migration of one heterocycle to the ipso position of the other around a central pentacoordinate P(V) atom. The strategy can be applied to complex drug-like molecules containing multiple reactive sites and polar functional groups, and also enables convergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing of drug fragments and late-stage heteroarylation of pharmaceuticals.</p>

A coupled-clock system drives the automaticity of human sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells
<p>The spontaneous rhythmic action potentials generated by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker in the heart, dictate the regular and optimal cardiac contractions that pump blood around the body. Although the heart rate of humans is substantially slower than that of smaller experimental animals, current perspectives on the biophysical mechanisms underlying the automaticity of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells (SANCs) have been gleaned largely from studies of animal hearts. Using human SANCs, we demonstrated that spontaneous rhythmic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases generated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> clock were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed to electrogenic surface membrane molecules (the M clock) to trigger rhythmic action potentials, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup>–cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling regulated clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. When these clocks became un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed, SANCs failed to generate spontaneous action potentials, showing a depolarized membrane potential and disorganized local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases that failed to activate the M clock. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, which increases cAMP concentrations and clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing in other species, restored spontaneous, rhythmic action potentials in some nonbeating “arrested” human SANCs by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and synchronizing diastolic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases. When β-AR stimulation was withdrawn, the clocks again became un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed, and SANCs reverted to a nonbeating arrested state. Thus, automaticity of human pacemaker cells is driven by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed-clock system driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling. Extreme clock un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing led to failure of spontaneous action potential generation, which was restored by re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing of the clocks. Clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing and action potential firing in some of these arrested cells can be restored by β-AR stimulation–induced augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling.</p>

Microtubule structures underlying the sarcoplasmic reticulum support peripheral coupling sites to regulate smooth muscle contractility
<p>Junctional membrane complexes facilitate excitation-contraction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells by forming subcellular invaginations that maintain close (≤20 nm) proximity of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the plasma membrane. In fully differentiated smooth muscle cells, junctional membrane complexes occur as distributed sites of peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. We investigated the role of the cytoskeleton in maintaining peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing and associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling networks within native smooth muscle cells of mouse and rat cerebral arteries. Using live-cell confocal and superresolution microscopy, we found that the tight interactions between the SR and the plasma membrane in these cells relied on arching microtubule structures present at the periphery of smooth muscle cells and were independent of the actin cytoskeleton. Loss of peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing associated with microtubule depolymerization altered the spatiotemporal properties of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks generated by the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through type 2 RyRs (RyR2s) on the SR and decreased the number of sites of colocalization between RyR2s and large-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channels. The reduced BK channel activity associated with the loss of SR–plasma membrane interactions was accompanied by increased pressure–induced constriction of cerebral resistance arteries. We conclude that microtubule structures maintain peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing in contractile smooth muscle cells, which is crucial for the regulation of contractility and cerebral vascular tone.</p>

Fitness Trade-Offs Lead to Suppressor Tolerance in Yeast
<p>Genetic variation among individuals within a population provides the raw material for phenotypic diversity upon which natural selection operates. Some given variants can act on multiple standing genomic variations simultaneously and release previously inaccessible phenotypes, leading to increased adaptive potential upon challenging environments. Previously, we identified such a variant related to a tRNA nonsense suppressor in yeast. When introduced into other genetic backgrounds, the suppressor led to an increased population phenotypic variance on various culture conditions, conferring background and environment specific selective advantages. Nonetheless, most isolates are intolerant to the suppressor on rich media due to a severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness cost. Here, we found that the tolerance to suppressor is related to a surprising level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness outburst, showing a trade-off effect to accommodate the cost of carrying the suppressor. To dissect the genetic basis of such trade-offs, we crossed strains with contrasting tolerance levels on rich media, and analyzed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness distribution patterns in the offspring. Combining quantitative tetrad analysis and bulk segregant analysis, we identified two genes, namely <i>MKT1</i> and <i>RGA1</i>, involved in suppressor tolerance. We showed that alleles from the tolerant parent for both genes conferred a significant gain of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness, which increased the suppressor tolerance. Our results present a detailed dissection of suppressor tolerance in yeast and provide insights into the molecular basis of trade-offs between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness and evolutionary potential.</p>

Strong Epistatic Interactions within a Single Protein
<p>A central question in protein molecular evolution is whether an amino acid that occurs at a given site makes an independent contribution to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness or whether its contribution depends on other amino acid sites in the protein sequence, a phenomenon known as intragenic epistasis. In the absence of intragenic epistasis, natural selection acts on a protein mutation independent of its genetic background, and the experimentally determined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness for a mutation should be the same across all genetic backgrounds. We tested this hypothesis by using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a well-characterized deleterious single amino acid substitution in 56 different hepatitis C virus NS3 protease variants. The catalytic efficiency of the mutated proteases was determined and compared with the corresponding wild-type protein. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness effects ranged from lethality to significantly beneficial. Although primarily deleterious and lethal effects were observed (41 and 5 out of 56 tested variants, respectively), deleterious effects ranged from near neutral (−26.7% reduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness) to near lethal (−98.5%). Our findings demonstrate that the introduced amino acid substitution has different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness effects in different protein variants and provide independent support for the relevant role of intragenic epistasis in protein evolution.</p>

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart pumps blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This pumping function is achieved through synchronous contraction of billions of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular calcium. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>e external electrical impulses to the triggering of calcium ion release from intracellular stores and subsequent activation of force-producing proteins, a process termed excitation-contraction (E-C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type calcium channel with the calcium-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the release of calcium ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold protein called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic calcium release during E-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing, reduced pumping capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and function as a transcription factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addition to its “day job” as a structural protein, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

Rapid change of superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling through critical doping in Bi-2212
<p>Electron-boson <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing plays a key role in superconductivity for many systems. However, in copper-based high–critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) superconductors, its relation to superconductivity remains controversial despite strong spectroscopic fingerprints. In this study, we used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to find a pronounced correlation between the superconducting gap and the bosonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+δ</sub>. The bosonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing strength rapidly increases from the overdoped Fermi liquid regime to the optimally doped strange metal, concomitant with the quadrupled superconducting gap and the doubled gap-to-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ratio across the pseudogap boundary. This synchronized lattice and electronic response suggests that the effects of electronic interaction and the electron-phonon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing (EPC) reinforce each other in a positive-feedback loop upon entering the strange-metal regime, which in turn drives a stronger superconductivity.</p>

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-phonon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-phonon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “coherent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-phonon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.</p>

RPA binds histone H3-H4 and functions in DNA replication–coupled nucleosome assembly

RPA directly binds free H3-H4. Assays using a synthetic sequence that mimics freshly unwound single-stranded DNA at replication fork showed that RPA promotes DNA-(H3-H4) complex formation immediately adjacent to double-stranded DNA. Further, an RPA mutant defective in H3-H4 binding exhibited attenuated nucleosome assembly on nascent chromatin. Thus, we propose that RPA functions as a platform for targeting histone deposition to replication fork, through which RPA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>es nucleosome assembly with ongoing DNA replication.</p>

High Fitness Costs and Instability of Gene Duplications Reduce Rates of Evolution of New Genes by Duplication-Divergence Mechanisms
<p>An important mechanism for generation of new genes is by duplication-divergence of existing genes. Duplication-divergence includes several different submodels, such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of neutral mutations the original function is distributed between two partially functional and complementary genes, and neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness cost and genetic stability of the duplications. Here, we determined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness cost and stability of defined gene duplications/amplifications on a low copy number plasmid. Our experimental results show that the costs of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each additional kilo base pairs of DNA reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene amplifications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness costs and instability strongly reduces the likelihood of both sub- and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial functions.</p>

Disabling the Gβγ-SNARE interaction disrupts GPCR-mediated presynaptic inhibition, leading to physiological and behavioral phenotypes
<p>G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptors (GPCRs) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>e to G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins modulate neurotransmission presynaptically by inhibiting exocytosis. Release of Gβγ subunits from activated G proteins decreases the activity of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs), decreasing excitability. A less understood Gβγ-mediated mechanism downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is the binding of Gβγ to SNARE complexes, which facilitate the fusion of vesicles with the cell plasma membrane in exocytosis. Here, we generated mice expressing a form of the SNARE protein SNAP25 with premature truncation of the C terminus and that were therefore partially deficient in this interaction. SNAP25Δ3 homozygote mice exhibited normal presynaptic inhibition by GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, which inhibit VGCCs, but defective presynaptic inhibition by receptors that work directly on the SNARE complex, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 5-HT<sub>1b</sub> receptors and adrenergic α<sub>2a</sub> receptors.

G protein–coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) orchestrate biased agonism at the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor
<p>Biased agonists of G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptors (GPCRs), which selectively activate either G protein– or β-arrestin–mediated signaling pathways, are of major therapeutic interest because they have the potential to show improved efficacy and specificity as drugs. Efforts to understand the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon have focused on the hypothesis that G proteins and β-arrestins preferentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>e to distinct GPCR conformations. However, because GPCR kinase (GRK)–dependent receptor phosphorylation is a critical prerequisite for the recruitment of β-arrestins to most GPCRs, GRKs themselves may play an important role in establishing biased signaling. We showed that an alanine mutant of the highly conserved residue tyrosine 219 (Y219A) in transmembrane domain five of the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) was incapable of β-arrestin recruitment, receptor internalization, and β-arrestin–mediated activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), whereas it retained the ability to signal through G protein. We found that the impaired β-arrestin recruitment in cells was due to reduced GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the β<sub>2</sub>AR Y219A C terminus, which was recapitulated in vitro with purified components. Furthermore, in vitro ligation of a synthetically phosphorylated peptide onto the C terminus of β<sub>2</sub>AR Y219A rescued both the initial recruitment of β-arrestin and its engagement with the intracellular core of the receptor. These data suggest that the Y219A mutation generates a G protein–biased state primarily by conformational selection against GRK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing, rather than against β-arrestin. Together, these findings highlight the importance of GRKs in modulating the biased agonism of GPCRs.</p>

G protein–coupled receptors control the sensitivity of cells to the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog
<p>The morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) patterns tissues during development by directing cell fates in a concentration-dependent manner. The SHH signal is transmitted across the membrane of target cells by the heptahelical transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO), which activates the GLI family of transcription factors through a mechanism that is undefined in vertebrates. Using CRISPR-edited null alleles and small-molecule inhibitors, we systematically analyzed the epistatic interactions between SMO and three proteins implicated in SMO signaling: the heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gα<sub>S</sub>, the G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), and the Gα<sub>S</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptor GPR161. Our experiments uncovered a signaling mechanism that modifies the sensitivity of target cells to SHH and consequently changes the shape of the SHH dose-response curve. In both fibroblasts and spinal neural progenitors, the loss of GPR161, previously implicated as an inhibitor of basal SHH signaling, increased the sensitivity of target cells across the entire spectrum of SHH concentrations. Even in cells lacking GPR161, GRK2 was required for SHH signaling, and Gα<sub>s</sub>, which promotes the activation of protein Kinase A (PKA), antagonized SHH signaling. We propose that the sensitivity of target cells to Hedgehog morphogens, and the consequent effects on gene expression and differentiation outcomes, can be controlled by signals from G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptors that converge on Gα<sub>s</sub> and PKA.</p>

Synergistic regulation of serotonin and opioid signaling contributes to pain insensitivity in Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 knockout mice
<p>Genetic loss of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7<sup>−/−</sup>) results in lifelong insensitivity to pain in mice and humans. One underlying cause is an increase in the production of endogenous opioids in sensory neurons. We analyzed whether Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 deficiency altered nociceptive heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptor (GPCR) signaling, such as initiated by GPCRs that respond to serotonin (pronociceptive) or opioids (antinociceptive), in sensory neurons. We found that the nociceptive neurons of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 knockout (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7<sup>−/−</sup>) mice, but not those of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 knockout (Na<sub>v</sub>1.8<sup>−/−</sup>) mice, exhibited decreased pronociceptive serotonergic signaling through the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, which are Gα<sub>s</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed GPCRs that stimulate the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulting in protein kinase A (PKA) activity, as well as reduced abundance of the RIIβ regulatory subunit of PKA. Simultaneously, the efficacy of antinociceptive opioid signaling mediated by the Gα<sub>i</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed mu opioid receptors was increased. Consequently, opioids inhibited more efficiently tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium currents, which are important for pain-initiating neuronal activity in nociceptive neurons. Thus, Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 controls the efficacy and balance of GPCR-mediated pro- and antinociceptive intracellular signaling, such that without Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, the balance is shifted toward antinociception, resulting in lifelong endogenous analgesia.</p>

Coupled ripple oscillations between the medial temporal lobe and neocortex retrieve human memory
<p>Episodic memory retrieval relies on the recovery of neural representations of waking experience. This process is thought to involve a communication dynamic between the medial temporal lobe memory system and the neocortex.

Mutation dynamics and fitness effects followed in single cells

By combining microfluidics, time-lapse imaging, and a fluorescent tag of the mismatch repair system in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we visualized the emergence of mutations in single cells, revealing Poissonian dynamics. Concomitantly, we tracked the growth and life span of single cells, accumulating ~20,000 mutations genome-wide over hundreds of generations. This analysis revealed that 1% of mutations were lethal; nonlethal mutations displayed a heavy-tailed distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness effects and were dominated by quasi-neutral mutations with an average cost of 0.3%.

Negative selection in humans and fruit flies involves synergistic epistasis
<p>Negative selection against deleterious alleles produced by mutation influences within-population variation as the most pervasive form of natural selection. However, it is not known whether deleterious alleles affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness independently, so that cumulative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness loss depends exponentially on the number of deleterious alleles, or synergistically, so that each additional deleterious allele results in a larger decrease in relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness. Negative selection with synergistic epistasis should produce negative linkage disequilibrium between deleterious alleles and, therefore, an underdispersed distribution of the number of deleterious alleles in the genome. Indeed, we detected underdispersion of the number of rare loss-of-function alleles in eight independent data sets from human and fly populations. Thus, selection against rare protein-disrupting alleles is characterized by synergistic epistasis, which may explain how human and fly populations persist despite high genomic mutation rates.</p>

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1
<p>In the search for renewable energy sources, genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve plant cell wall composition for biofuel and bioproducts generation. Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to engineer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thioacidolysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic acid and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic acid and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar platform industry.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic bene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>s associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

A Key Role for Apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Norway Spruce Phenolic Metabolism
<p>Apoplastic events such as monolignol oxidation and lignin polymerization are difficult to study in intact trees. To investigate the role of apoplastic hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in gymnosperm phenolic metabolism, an extracellular lignin-forming cell culture of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) was used as a research model. Scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by potassium iodide repressed lignin formation, in line with peroxidases activating monolignols for lignin polymerization. Time-course analyses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed to candidate substrate-product pair network propagation revealed differential accumulation of low-molecular-weight phenolics, including (glycosylated) oligolignols, (glycosylated) flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins, in lignin-forming and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging cultures and supported that monolignols are oxidatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed not only in the cell wall but also in the cytoplasm, where they are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed to other monolignols and proanthocyanidins. Dilignol glycoconjugates with reduced structures were found in the culture medium, suggesting that cells are able to transport glycosylated dilignols to the apoplast. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in remodulation of the transcriptome, with reduced carbon flux into the shikimate pathway propagating down to monolignol biosynthesis. Aggregated coexpression network analysis identified candidate enzymes and transcription factors for monolignol oxidation and apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in addition to potential H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> receptors. The results presented indicate that the redox state of the apoplast has a profound influence on cellular metabolism.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6
<p>Dirigent proteins impart stereoselectivity to phenoxy radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing reactions in plants and, thus, play an essential role in the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products. This includes the regioselective and enantioselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing and subsequent cyclization of two coniferyl alcohol radicals to pinoresinol as the committed step of lignan biosynthesis. The reaction is controlled by dirigent proteins, which, depending on the species and protein, direct the reaction to either (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol. We present the crystal structure of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å resolution. The structure shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-separated cavities for substrate binding. The binding cavities are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The structure supports a model in which two substrate radicals bind to each of the DIR monomers. With the aromatic rings fixed in the two pockets, the propionyl side chains face each other for radical-radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing, and stereoselectivity is determined by the exact positioning of the side chains. Extensive mutational analysis supports a previously unrecognized function for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclization of the bis-quinone methide reaction intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–selection models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

Strong spin-photon coupling in silicon
<p>Long coherence times of single spins in silicon quantum dots make these systems highly attractive for quantum computation, but how to scale up spin qubit systems remains an open question. As a first step to address this issue, we demonstrate the strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing of a single electron spin and a single microwave photon. The electron spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave photon is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric field component of the cavity photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>es directly to the charge dipole of the electron in the double dot, and indirectly to the electron spin, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet. Our results provide a route to realizing large networks of quantum dot–based spin qubit registers.</p>

Genome-wide identification of interferon-sensitive mutations enables influenza vaccine design
<p>In conventional attenuated viral vaccines, immunogenicity is often suboptimal. Here we present a systematic approach for vaccine development that eliminates interferon (IFN)–modulating functions genome-wide while maintaining virus replication <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness. We applied a quantitative high-throughput genomics system to influenza A virus that simultaneously measured the replication <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness and IFN sensitivity of mutations across the entire genome. By incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, we generated a hyper–interferon-sensitive (HIS) virus as a vaccine candidate. HIS virus is highly attenuated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses, elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our approach, which attenuates the virus and promotes immune responses concurrently, is broadly applicable for vaccine development against other pathogens.</p>

Learning-enhanced coupling between ripple oscillations in association cortices and hippocampus
<p>Consolidation of declarative memories requires hippocampal-neocortical communication. Although experimental evidence supports the role of sharp-wave ripples in transferring hippocampal information to the neocortex, the exact cortical destinations and the physiological mechanisms of such transfer are not known. We used a conducting polymer-based conformable microelectrode array (NeuroGrid) to record local field potentials and neural spiking across the dorsal cortical surface of the rat brain, combined with silicon probe recordings in the hippocampus, to identify candidate physiological patterns. Parietal, midline, and prefrontal, but not primary cortical areas, displayed localized ripple (100 to 150 hertz) oscillations during sleep, concurrent with hippocampal ripples. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing between hippocampal and neocortical ripples was strengthened during sleep following learning. These findings suggest that ripple-ripple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing supports hippocampal-association cortical transfer of memory traces.</p>

Chaos-assisted broadband momentum transformation in optical microresonators
<p>The law of momentum conservation rules out many desired processes in optical microresonators. We report broadband momentum transformations of light in asymmetric whispering gallery microresonators. Assisted by chaotic motions, broadband light can travel between optical modes with different angular momenta within a few picoseconds. Efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing from visible to near-infrared bands is demonstrated between a nanowaveguide and whispering gallery modes with quality factors exceeding 10 million. The broadband momentum transformation enhances the device conversion efficiency of the third-harmonic generation by greater than three orders of magnitude over the conventional evanescent-wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. The observed broadband and fast momentum transformation could promote applications such as multicolor lasers, broadband memories, and multiwavelength optical networks.</p>

Quantum acoustics with superconducting qubits
<p>Mechanical objects have important practical applications in the fields of quantum information and metrology as quantum memories or transducers for measuring and connecting different types of quantum systems. The field of electromechanics is in pursuit of a robust and highly coherent device that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>es motion to nonlinear quantum objects such as superconducting qubits. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a high-frequency bulk acoustic wave resonator that is strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed to a superconducting qubit using piezoelectric transduction with a cooperativity of 260. We measure qubit and mechanical coherence times on the order of 10 microseconds. Our device requires only simple fabrication methods and provides controllable access to a multitude of phonon modes. We demonstrate quantum control and measurement on gigahertz phonons at the single-quantum level.</p>

Ruthenium-catalyzed insertion of adjacent diol carbon atoms into C-C bonds: Entry to type II polyketides

Snap deconvolution: An informatics approach to high-throughput discovery of catalytic reactions
<p>We present an approach to multidimensional high-throughput discovery of catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing reactions that integrates molecular design with automated analysis and interpretation of mass spectral data. We simultaneously assessed the reactivity of three pools of compounds that shared the same functional groups (halides, boronic acids, alkenes, and alkynes, among other groups) but carried inactive substituents having specifically designed differences in masses. The substituents were chosen such that the products from any class of reaction in multiple reaction sets would have unique differences in masses, thus allowing simultaneous identification of the products of all transformations in a set of reactants. In this way, we easily distinguished the products of new reactions from noise and known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ings. Using this method, we discovered an alkyne hydroallylation and a nickel-catalyzed variant of alkyne diarylation.</p>

Locked synchronous rotor motion in a molecular motor
<p>Biological molecular motors translate their local directional motion into ordered movement of other parts of the system to empower controlled mechanical functions. The design of analogous geared systems that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>e motion in a directional manner, which is pivotal for molecular machinery operating at the nanoscale, remains highly challenging. Here, we report a molecular rotary motor that translates light-driven unidirectional rotary motion to controlled movement of a connected biaryl rotor. Achieving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed motion of the distinct parts of this multicomponent mechanical system required precise control of multiple kinetic barriers for isomerization and synchronous motion, resulting in sliding and rotation during a full rotary cycle, with the motor always facing the same face of the rotor.</p>

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within communities can interact to organize their behavior. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the behavior of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm communities undergoing metabolic oscillations can become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase oscillations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their behavior to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

A parity-breaking electronic nematic phase transition in the spin-orbit coupled metal Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
<p>Strong electron interactions can drive metallic systems toward a variety of well-known symmetry-broken phases, but the instabilities of correlated metals with strong spin-orbit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing have only recently begun to be explored. We uncovered a multipolar nematic phase of matter in the metallic pyrochlore Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> using spatially resolved second-harmonic optical anisotropy measurements. Like previously discovered electronic nematic phases, this multipolar phase spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry while preserving translational invariance. However, it has the distinguishing property of being odd under spatial inversion, which is allowed only in the presence of spin-orbit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. By examining the critical behavior of the multipolar nematic order parameter, we show that it drives the thermal phase transition near 200 kelvin in Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and induces a parity-breaking lattice distortion as a secondary order.</p>

Architecture of a transcribing-translating expressome
<p>DNA transcription is functionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed to messenger RNA (mRNA) translation in bacteria, but how this is achieved remains unclear. Here we show that RNA polymerase (RNAP) and the ribosome of <i>Escherichia coli</i> can form a defined transcribing and translating “expressome” complex. The cryo–electron microscopic structure of the expressome reveals continuous protection of ~30 nucleotides of mRNA extending from the RNAP active center to the ribosome decoding center. The RNAP-ribosome interface includes the RNAP subunit α carboxyl-terminal domain, which is required for RNAP-ribosome interaction in vitro and for pronounced cell growth defects upon translation inhibition in vivo, consistent with its function in transcription-translation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. The expressome structure can only form during transcription elongation and explains how translation can prevent transcriptional pausing, backtracking, and termination.</p>

Bug mapping and fitness testing of chemically synthesized chromosome X
<p>Debugging a genome sequence is imperative for successfully building a synthetic genome. As part of the effort to build a designer eukaryotic genome, yeast synthetic chromosome X (synX), designed as 707,459 base pairs, was synthesized chemically. SynX exhibited good <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness under a wide variety of conditions. A highly efficient mapping strategy called pooled PCRTag mapping (PoPM), which can be generalized to any watermarked synthetic chromosome, was developed to identify genetic alterations that affect cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness (“bugs”). A series of bugs were corrected that included a large region bearing complex amplifications, a growth defect mapping to a recoded sequence in <i>FIP1</i>, and a loxPsym site affecting promoter function of <i>ATP2</i>. PoPM is a powerful tool for synthetic yeast genome debugging and an efficient strategy for phenotype-genotype mapping.</p>

Radical-polar crossover reactions of vinylboron ate complexes
<p>Vinyl boronic esters are valuable substrates for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing reactions. However, boron-substituted alkenes have drawn little attention as radical acceptors, and the radical chemistry of vinylboron ate complexes is underexplored. We show here that carbon radicals add efficiently to vinylboron ate complexes and that their adduct radical anions undergo radical-polar crossover: A 1,2-alkyl/aryl shift from boron to the α-carbon sp<sup>2</sup> center provides secondary or tertiary alkyl boronic esters. In contrast to the Suzuki-Miyaura <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing, a transition metal is not required, and two carbon-carbon bonds are formed. The valuable boronic ester moiety remains in the product and can be used in follow-up chemistry, enlarging the chemical space of the method. The cascade uses commercial starting materials and provides access to perfluoroalkylated alcohols, γ-lactones, γ-hydroxy alkylnitriles, and compounds bearing quaternary carbon centers.</p>

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of an atomically thin material using a single-spin qubit
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a promising platform for exploring condensed matter phenomena and developing technological applications. However, the reduction of material dimensions to the atomic scale poses a challenge for traditional measurement and interfacing techniques that typically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>e to macroscopic observables. We demonstrate a method for probing the properties of 2D materials via nanometer-scale nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy using individual atomlike impurities in diamond. Coherent manipulation of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers enables the probing of nanoscale ensembles down to approximately 30 nuclear spins in atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The characterization of low-dimensional nanoscale materials could enable the development of new quantum hybrid systems, combining atomlike systems coherently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed with individual atoms in 2D materials.</p>

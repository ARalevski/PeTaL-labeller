Reconfigured Cyanogenic Glucoside Biosynthesis in <i>Eucalyptus cladocalyx</i> Involves a Cytochrome P450 CYP706C55
<p>Cyanogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glucosid</span></strong>es are a class of specialized metabolites widespread in the plant kingdom. Cyanogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glucosid</span></strong>es are α-hydroxynitriles, and their hydrolysis releases toxic hydrogen cyanide, providing an effective chemical defense against herbivores. <i>Eucalyptus cladocalyx</i> is a cyanogenic tree, allocating up to 20% of leaf nitrogen to the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic mono<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glucosid</span></strong>e, prunasin. Here, mass spectrometry analyses of <i>E. cladocalyx</i> tissues revealed spatial and ontogenetic variations in prunasin content, as well as the presence of the cyanogenic di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glucosid</span></strong>e amygdalin in flower buds and flowers. The identification and biochemical characterization of the prunasin biosynthetic enzymes revealed a unique enzyme configuration for prunasin production in <i>E. cladocalyx</i>. This result indicates that a multifunctional cytochrome P450 (CYP), CYP79A125, catalyzes the initial conversion of <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine into its corresponding aldoxime, phenylacetaldoxime; a function consistent with other members of the CYP79 family. In contrast to the single multifunctional CYP known from other plant species, the conversion of phenylacetaldoxime to the α-hydroxynitrile, mandelonitrile, is catalyzed by two distinct CYPs. CYP706C55 catalyzes the dehydration of phenylacetaldoxime, an unusual CYP reaction. The resulting phenylacetonitrile is subsequently hydroxylatedby CYP71B103 to form mandelonitrile. The final glucosylation step to yield prunasin is catalyzed by a UDP-glucosyltransferase, UGT85A59. Members of the CYP706 family have not been reported previously to participate in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glucosid</span></strong>es, and the pathway structure in <i>E. cladocalyx</i> represents an example of convergent evolution in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glucosid</span></strong>es in plants.</p>

Mixed tailing by TENT4A and TENT4B shields mRNA from rapid deadenylation
<p>RNA tails play integral roles in the regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation and decay. Guanylation of the poly(A) tail was discovered recently, yet the enzymology and function remain obscure. Here we identify TENT4A (PAPD7) and TENT4B (PAPD5) as the enzymes responsible for mRNA guanylation. Purified TENT4 proteins generate a mixed poly(A) tail with intermittent non-adenosine residues, the most common of which is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e. A single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e residue is sufficient to impede the deadenylase CCR4-NOT complex, which trims the tail and exposes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e at the 3′ end. Consistently, depletion of TENT4A and TENT4B leads to a decrease in mRNA half-life and abundance in cells. Thus, TENT4A and TENT4B produce a mixed tail that shields mRNA from rapid deadenylation. Our study unveils the role of mixed tailing and expands the complexity of posttranscriptional gene regulation.</p>

KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibition produces a driver-limited state revealing collateral dependencies
<p>Inhibitors targeting KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, a mutant form of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e triphosphatase (GTPase) KRAS, are a promising new class of oncogene-specific therapeutics for the treatment of tumors driven by the mutant protein.

Our data revealed genes that were selectively essential in this oncogenic driver–limited cell state, meaning that their loss enhanced cellular susceptibility to direct KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibition. We termed such genes “collateral dependencies” (CDs) and identified two classes of combination therapies targeting these CDs that increased KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> target engagement or blocked residual survival pathways in cells and in vivo.

Structure of the C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor module of Trio in an autoinhibited conformation reveals its oncogenic potential
<p>The C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) module of Trio (TrioC) transfers signals from the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins to the small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e triphosphatase (GTPase) RhoA, enabling Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) to control downstream events, such as cell motility and gene transcription. This conserved signal transduction axis is crucial for tumor growth in uveal melanoma. Previous studies indicate that the GEF activity of the TrioC module is autoinhibited, with release of autoinhibition upon Gα<sub>q/11</sub> binding. Here, we determined the crystal structure of TrioC in its basal state and found that the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain interacts with the Dbl homology (DH) domain in a manner that occludes the Rho GTPase binding site, thereby suggesting the molecular basis of TrioC autoinhibition. Biochemical and biophysical assays revealed that disruption of the autoinhibited conformation destabilized and activated the TrioC module in vitro. Last, mutations in the DH-PH interface found in patients with cancer activated TrioC and, in the context of full-length Trio, led to increased abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e triphosphate–bound RhoA (RhoA·GTP) in human cells. These mutations increase mitogenic signaling through the RhoA axis and, therefore, may represent cancer drivers operating in a Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-independent manner.</p>

Targeting nucleotide exchange to inhibit constitutively active G protein α subunits in cancer cells
<p>Constitutively active G protein α subunits cause cancer, cholera, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and other disorders. Therapeutic intervention by targeted inhibition of constitutively active Gα subunits in these disorders has yet to be achieved. We found that constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub> in uveal melanoma (UM) cells was inhibited by the cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR). FR allosterically inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e diphosphate–for–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e triphosphate (GDP/GTP) exchange to trap constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub> in inactive, GDP-bound Gαβγ heterotrimers. Allosteric inhibition of other Gα subunits was achieved by the introduction of an FR-binding site. In UM cells driven by constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub>, FR inhibited second messenger signaling, arrested cell proliferation, reinstated melanocytic differentiation, and stimulated apoptosis. In contrast, FR had no effect on <i>BRAF</i>-driven UM cells. FR promoted UM cell differentiation by reactivating polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)–mediated gene silencing, a heretofore unrecognized effector system of constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub> in UM. Constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub> and PRC2 therefore provide therapeutic targets for UM. The development of FR analogs specific for other Gα subunit subtypes may provide novel therapeutic approaches for diseases driven by constitutively active Gα subunits or multiple G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) where targeting a single receptor is ineffective.</p>

Metabolic regulation of transcription through compartmentalized NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis
<p>NAD<sup>+</sup> (nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide in its oxidized state) is an essential molecule for a variety of physiological processes. It is synthesized in distinct subcellular compartments by three different synthases (NMNAT-1, -2, and -3). We found that compartmentalized NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis by NMNATs integrates glucose metabolism and adipogenic transcription during adipocyte differentiation. Adipogenic signaling rapidly induces cytoplasmic NMNAT-2, which competes with nuclear NMNAT-1 for the common substrate, nicotinamide mononucleotide, leading to a precipitous reduction in nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> levels. This inhibits the catalytic activity of poly[adenosine diphosphate (ADP)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribos</span></strong>e] polymerase–1 (PARP-1), a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzyme that represses adipogenic transcription by ADP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribos</span></strong>ylating the adipogenic transcription factor C/EBPβ. Reversal of PARP-1–mediated repression by NMNAT-2–mediated nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in response to adipogenic signals drives adipogenesis. Thus, compartmentalized NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis functions as an integrator of cellular metabolism and signal-dependent transcriptional programs.</p>

A conserved NAD<sup>+</sup> binding pocket that regulates protein-protein interactions during aging
<p>DNA repair is essential for life, yet its efficiency declines with age for reasons that are unclear. Numerous proteins possess Nudix homology domains (NHDs) that have no known function. We show that NHDs are NAD<sup>+</sup> (oxidized form of nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide) binding domains that regulate protein-protein interactions. The binding of NAD<sup>+</sup> to the NHD domain of DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) prevents it from inhibiting PARP1 [poly(adenosine diphosphate–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribos</span></strong>e) polymerase], a critical DNA repair protein. As mice age and NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations decline, DBC1 is increasingly bound to PARP1, causing DNA damage to accumulate, a process rapidly reversed by restoring the abundance of NAD<sup>+</sup>. Thus, NAD<sup>+</sup> directly regulates protein-protein interactions, the modulation of which may protect against cancer, radiation, and aging.</p>

Efficient Replication of the Plastid Genome Requires an Organellar Thymidine Kinase
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thymidin</span></strong>e kinase (TK) is a key enzyme of the salvage pathway that recycles <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thymidin</span></strong>e nucleosides to produce deoxy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thymidin</span></strong>e triphosphate. Here, we identified the single TK of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), denoted CPTK1, as necessary in the replication of the plastidial genome (cpDNA), demonstrating the essential function of the salvage pathway during chloroplast biogenesis. CPTK1 localized to both plastids and mitochondria, and its absence resulted in an albino phenotype, reduced cpDNA copy number and a severe deficiency in plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribos</span></strong>omes. Mitochondria were not affected, indicating they are less reliant on the salvage pathway. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) TKs, TK1A and TK1B, apparently resulted from a gene duplication after the divergence of monocots and dicots. Similar but less-severe effects were observed for Arabidopsis <i>tk1a tk1b</i> double mutants in comparison to those in maize <i>cptk1</i>. TK1B was important for cpDNA replication and repair in conditions of replicative stress but had little impact on the mitochondrial phenotype. In the maize <i>cptk1</i> mutant, the DNA from the small single-copy region of the plastidial genome was reduced to a greater extent than other regions, suggesting preferential abortion of replication in this region. This was accompanied by the accumulation of truncated genomes that resulted, at least in part, from unfaithful microhomology-mediated repair. These and other results suggest that the loss of normal cpDNA replication elicits the mobilization of new replication origins around the <i>rpoB</i> (beta subunit of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase) transcription unit and imply that increased transcription at <i>rpoB</i> is associated with the initiation of cpDNA replication.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Daurichromenic Acid Synthase Active in Anti-HIV Biosynthesis
<p>Daurichromenic acid (DCA) synthase catalyzes the oxidative cyclization of grifolic acid to produce DCA, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid isolated from <i>Rhododendron dauricum</i>. We identified a novel cDNA encoding DCA synthase by transcriptome-based screening from young leaves of <i>R. dauricum</i>. The gene coded for a 533-amino acid polypeptide with moderate homologies to flavin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide oxidases from other plants. The primary structure contained an amino-terminal signal peptide and conserved amino acid residues to form bicovalent linkage to the flavin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide isoalloxazine ring at histidine-112 and cysteine-175. In addition, the recombinant DCA synthase, purified from the culture supernatant of transgenic <i>Pichia pastoris</i>, exhibited structural and functional properties as a flavoprotein. The reaction mechanism of DCA synthase characterized herein partly shares a similarity with those of cannabinoid synthases from <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, whereas DCA synthase catalyzes a novel cyclization reaction of the farnesyl moiety of a meroterpenoid natural product of plant origin. Moreover, in this study, we present evidence that DCA is biosynthesized and accumulated specifically in the glandular scales, on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants, based on various analytical studies at the chemical, biochemical, and molecular levels. The extracellular localization of DCA also was confirmed by a confocal microscopic analysis of its autofluorescence. These data highlight the unique feature of DCA: the final step of biosynthesis is completed in apoplastic space, and it is highly accumulated outside the scale cells.</p>

Nicotinamide Riboside Preserves Cardiac Function in a Mouse Model of Dilated Cardiomyopathy

Little is known on the mechanisms regulating homeostasis of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the failing heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To explore possible alterations of NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in the failing heart, we quantified the expression of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes in the human failing heart and in the heart of a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) triggered by Serum Response Factor transcription factor depletion in the heart (SRF<sup>HKO</sup>) or of cardiac hypertrophy triggered by transverse aorta constriction. We studied the impact of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor supplementation on cardiac function in both mouse models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed a 30% loss in levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the murine failing heart of both DCM and transverse aorta constriction mice that was accompanied by a decrease in expression of the nicotinamide phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribos</span></strong>yltransferase enzyme that recycles the nicotinamide precursor, whereas the nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribos</span></strong>ide kinase 2 (NMRK2) that phosphorylates the nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribos</span></strong>ide precursor is increased, to a higher level in the DCM (40-fold) than in transverse aorta constriction (4-fold). This shift was also observed in human failing heart biopsies in comparison with nonfailing controls. We show that the <i>Nmrk2</i> gene is an AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α responsive gene that is activated by energy stress and NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in isolated rat cardiomyocytes.

The lysine deacetylase Sirtuin 1 modulates the localization and function of the Notch1 receptor in regulatory T cells
<p>The ability to tune cellular functions in response to nutrient availability has important consequences for immune homeostasis. The activity of the receptor Notch in regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, which suppress the functions of effector T cells, is indispensable for T<sub>reg</sub> cell survival under conditions of diminished nutrient supply. Anti-apoptotic signaling induced by the Notch1 intracellular domain (NIC) originates from the cytoplasm and is spatially decoupled from the nuclear, largely transcriptional functions of NIC. We showed that Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), which is an NAD<sup>+</sup> (nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide)–dependent lysine deacetylase that inhibits NIC-dependent gene transcription, stabilized NIC proximal to the plasma membrane to promote the survival and function of activated T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Sirt1 was required for NIC-dependent protection from apoptosis in cell lines but not for the activity of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. In addition, a variant NIC protein in which four lysines were mutated to arginines (NIC4KR) retained anti-apoptotic activity, but was not regulated by Sirt1, and reconstituted the functions of nonnuclear NIC in Notch1-deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Loss of Sirt1 compromised T<sub>reg</sub> cell survival, resulting in antigen-induced T cell proliferation and inflammation in two mouse models. Thus, the Sirt1-Notch interaction may constitute an important checkpoint that tunes noncanonical Notch1 signaling.</p>

Cytoskeletal adaptivity regulates T cell receptor signaling
<p>The factors that govern T cell activation control the initiation and progression of adaptive immune responses. T cells recognize their cognate antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through the T cell receptor, which results in the formation of a contact region (immune synapse) between the two cells and the activation of the T cells. Activated T cells proliferate and differentiate into effector T cells that secrete cytokines, provide help to B cells, and kill target cells. We asked whether the actin cytoskeleton governs differences in signaling in effector T cells versus naive (unstimulated) T cells. Using atomic force microscopy and quantitative confocal microscopy, we found that naive T cells had a mechanically stiffer cortical cytoskeleton than that of effector cells, which resulted in naive cells forming smaller immune synapses with APCs. This suggests that the cytoskeletal stiffness of the T cell before it undergoes antigen stimulation predicts its subsequent dynamic engagement with APCs and its activation potential. Cytoskeletal rigidity depended on the activity of the actin-severing enzyme cofilin through a pathway requiring the small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e triphosphatase RhoA and the kinases ROCK (Rho-activated kinase) and LIMK. These findings suggest that the baseline cytoskeletal state controls T cell responses and that the underlying pathway could be a therapeutic target for modulating adaptive immunity.</p>

Structural basis for eIF2B inhibition in integrated stress response
<p>A core event in the integrated stress response, an adaptive pathway common to all eukaryotic cells in response to various stress stimuli, is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2). Normally, unphosphorylated eIF2 transfers the methionylated initiator tRNA to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribos</span></strong>ome in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e 5′-triphosphate–dependent manner. By contrast, phosphorylated eIF2 inhibits its specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. To elucidate how the eIF2 phosphorylation status regulates the eIF2B activity, we determined cryo–electron microscopic and crystallographic structures of eIF2B in complex with unphosphorylated or phosphorylated eIF2. The unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of eIF2 bind to eIF2B in completely different manners: the nucleotide exchange-active and -inactive modes, respectively. These structures explain how phosphorylated eIF2 dominantly inhibits the nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B.</p>

eIF2B-catalyzed nucleotide exchange and phosphoregulation by the integrated stress response
<p>The integrated stress response (ISR) tunes the rate of protein synthesis. Control is exerted by phosphorylation of the general translation initiation factor eIF2. eIF2 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e triphosphatase that becomes activated by eIF2B, a two-fold symmetric and heterodecameric complex that functions as eIF2’s dedicated nucleotide exchange factor. Phosphorylation converts eIF2 from a substrate into an inhibitor of eIF2B. We report cryo–electron microscopy structures of eIF2 bound to eIF2B in the dephosphorylated state. The structures reveal that the eIF2B decamer is a static platform upon which one or two flexible eIF2 trimers bind and align with eIF2B’s bipartite catalytic centers to catalyze nucleotide exchange. Phosphorylation refolds eIF2α, allowing it to contact eIF2B at a different interface and, we surmise, thereby sequestering it into a nonproductive complex.</p>

Cytosine, but not adenine, base editors induce genome-wide off-target mutations in rice

However, genome-wide and unbiased analyses of their off-target effects in vivo are still lacking. Our whole-genome sequencing analysis of rice plants treated with the third-generation base editor (BE3), high-fidelity BE3 (HF1-BE3), or ABE revealed that BE3 and HF1-BE3, but not ABE, induce substantial genome-wide off-target mutations, which are mostly the C→T type of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and appear to be enriched in genic regions. Notably, treatment of rice with BE3 or HF1-BE3 in the absence of single-guide RNA also results in the rise of genome-wide SNVs. Thus, the base-editing unit of BE3 or HF1-BE3 needs to be optimized in order to attain high fidelity.</p>

Live superresolution single-molecule imaging revealed that the protein Rho of Plants 6 (ROP6) is stabilized by phosphatidylserine into plasma membrane nanodomains, which are required for auxin signaling. Our experiments also revealed that the plasma membrane phosphatidylserine content varies during plant root development and that the level of phosphatidylserine modulates the quantity of ROP6 nanoclusters induced by auxin and hence downstream signaling, including regulation of endocytosis and gravitropism. Our work shows that variations in phosphatidylserine levels are a physiological process that may be leveraged to regulate small GTPase signaling during development.</p>

Dampening oncogenic RAS signaling
<p>The control of normal cellular homeostasis is a function of signaling by the RAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e triphosphatases (GTPases) KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS and their downstream signaling proteins, such as the RAF kinases (BRAF and CRAF), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), which together constitute the RAS-MAPK pathway (<i>1</i>). This pathway is dysregulated in human diseases, particularly cancer, in which mutations or other nongenetic events hyperactivate the pathway in more than 50% of cases (<i>1</i>). Activating mutations in RAS genes occur in more than 30% of all cancers and seemingly lock RAS into a constitutively active, GTP-bound state to signal autonomously without the need for upstream input (<i>1</i>). Therapeutic suppression of pathogenic RASMAPK signaling to maximize disease control in cancer patients remains an elusive goal. Multiple strategies targeting upstream [e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)] or downstream (e.g., MEK) RAS pathway proteins to limit RAS-GTP–mediated signaling in RAS-MAPK pathway–driven cancers are under evaluation (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). However, recent studies have extended our knowledge of how certain forms of oncogenic RAS and other oncogenic MAPK pathway proteins function not in an autonomous manner but instead semiautonomously, such that they still respond to upstream regulation (<i>4</i>–<i>8</i>). These findings reveal mechanisms by which RAS signaling is dysregulated in cancer and highlight newly identified therapeutic strategies with the potential to target oncogenic RAS-MAPK signaling.</p>

RIT1 oncoproteins escape LZTR1-mediated proteolysis
<p>RIT1 oncoproteins have emerged as an etiologic factor in Noonan syndrome and cancer. Despite the resemblance of RIT1 to other members of the Ras small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e triphosphatases (GTPases), mutations affecting RIT1 are not found in the classic hotspots but rather in a region near the switch II domain of the protein. We used an isogenic germline knock-in mouse model to study the effects of RIT1 mutation at the organismal level, which resulted in a phenotype resembling Noonan syndrome. By mass spectrometry, we detected a RIT1 interactor, leucine zipper–like transcription regulator 1 (LZTR1), that acts as an adaptor for protein degradation. Pathogenic mutations affecting either RIT1 or LZTR1 resulted in incomplete degradation of RIT1. This led to RIT1 accumulation and dysregulated growth factor signaling responses. Our results highlight a mechanism of pathogenesis that relies on impaired protein degradation of the Ras GTPase RIT1.</p>

Direct stimulation of NADP<sup>+</sup> synthesis through Akt-mediated phosphorylation of NAD kinase
<p>Nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide phosphate (NADP<sup>+</sup>) is essential for producing NADPH, the primary cofactor for reductive metabolism. We find that growth factor signaling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt pathway induces acute synthesis of NADP<sup>+</sup> and NADPH. Akt phosphorylates NAD kinase (NADK), the sole cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of NADP<sup>+</sup> from NAD<sup>+</sup> (the oxidized form of NADH), on three serine residues (Ser<sup>44</sup>, Ser<sup>46</sup>, and Ser<sup>48</sup>) within an amino-terminal domain. This phosphorylation stimulates NADK activity both in cells and directly in vitro, thereby increasing NADP<sup>+</sup> production. A rare isoform of NADK (isoform 3) lacking this regulatory region exhibits constitutively increased activity. These data indicate that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of NADK stimulates its activity to increase NADP<sup>+</sup> production through relief of an autoinhibitory function inherent to its amino terminus.</p>

Adaptations of an ancient modular machine
<p>All expressions of life ultimately depend on energy derived from redox chemistry and photosynthesis. On page 257 of this issue, Schuller <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the structure of photosynthetic complex I at atomic resolution. The authors have analyzed how the distinct NADH [reduced form of oxidized nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>)] dehydrogenase subunit S (NdhS) facilitates electron transfer from ferredoxin, thereby establishing efficient cyclic electron flow around photosystem I. The findings add an important piece to the puzzle of deciphering the enigmatic mechanisms at work in the remarkable molecular machines of the complex I superfamily encompassing photosynthetic and respiratory complex I, as well as proton pumping hydrogenases. In combination with high resolution structures of respiratory complex I from bacteria (<i>2</i>), mitochondria (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>), and membrane bound hydrogenase (<i>6</i>), it is now possible to trace the modular evolution and functional adaptations of the complex I superfamily at the atomic level.</p>

Structures and gating mechanism of human TRPM2
<p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a cation channel associated with numerous diseases. It has a C-terminal NUDT9 homology (NUDT9H) domain responsible for binding adenosine diphosphate (ADP)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribos</span></strong>e (ADPR), and both ADPR and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are required for TRPM2 activation. Here we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of human TRPM2 alone, with ADPR, and with ADPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. NUDT9H forms both intra- and intersubunit interactions with the N-terminal TRPM homology region (MHR1/2/3) in the apo state but undergoes conformational changes upon ADPR binding, resulting in rotation of MHR1/2 and disruption of the intersubunit interaction. The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> further engages transmembrane helices and the conserved TRP helix to cause conformational changes at the MHR arm and the lower gating pore to potentiate channel opening. These findings explain the molecular mechanism of concerted TRPM2 gating by ADPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and provide insights into the gating mechanism of other TRP channels.</p>

Mutations in LZTR1 drive human disease by dysregulating RAS ubiquitination
<p>The leucine zipper–like transcriptional regulator 1 (LZTR1) protein, an adaptor for cullin 3 (CUL3) ubiquitin ligase complex, is implicated in human disease, yet its mechanism of action remains unknown. We found that Lztr1 haploinsufficiency in mice recapitulates Noonan syndrome phenotypes, whereas LZTR1 loss in Schwann cells drives dedifferentiation and proliferation. By trapping LZTR1 complexes from intact mammalian cells, we identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e triphosphatase RAS as a substrate for the LZTR1-CUL3 complex. Ubiquitome analysis showed that loss of Lztr1 abrogated Ras ubiquitination at lysine-170. LZTR1-mediated ubiquitination inhibited RAS signaling by attenuating its association with the membrane. Disease-associated <i>LZTR1</i> mutations disrupted either LZTR1-CUL3 complex formation or its interaction with RAS proteins. RAS regulation by LZTR1-mediated ubiquitination provides an explanation for the role of LZTR1 in human disease.</p>

Poly(ADP-ribose) drives pathologic α-synuclein neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease
<p>The pathologic accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) underlies Parkinson’s disease (PD). The molecular mechanisms by which pathologic α-syn causes neurodegeneration in PD are not known. Here, we found that pathologic α-syn activates poly(adenosine 5′-diphosphate–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribos</span></strong>e) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), and PAR generation accelerates the formation of pathologic α-syn, resulting in cell death via parthanatos. PARP inhibitors or genetic deletion of PARP-1 prevented pathologic α-syn toxicity. In a feed-forward loop, PAR converted pathologic α-syn to a more toxic strain. PAR levels were increased in the cerebrospinal fluid and brains of patients with PD, suggesting that PARP activation plays a role in PD pathogenesis. Thus, strategies aimed at inhibiting PARP-1 activation could hold promise as a disease-modifying therapy to prevent the loss of dopamine neurons in PD.</p>

Semisynthetic sensor proteins enable metabolic assays at the point of care
<p>Monitoring metabolites at the point of care could improve the diagnosis and management of numerous diseases. Yet for most metabolites, such assays are not available. We introduce semisynthetic, light-emitting sensor proteins for use in paper-based metabolic assays. The metabolite is oxidized by nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide phosphate, and the sensor changes color in the presence of the reduced cofactor, enabling metabolite quantification with the use of a digital camera. The approach makes any metabolite that can be oxidized by the cofactor a candidate for quantitative point-of-care assays, as shown for phenylalanine, glucose, and glutamate. Phenylalanine blood levels of phenylketonuria patients were analyzed at the point of care within minutes with only 0.5 microliters of blood. Results were within 15% of those obtained with standard testing methods.</p>

Severing enzymes amplify microtubule arrays through lattice GTP-tubulin incorporation
<p>Spastin and katanin sever and destabilize microtubules. Paradoxically, despite their destructive activity they increase microtubule mass in vivo. We combined single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy to show that the elemental step in microtubule severing is the generation of nanoscale damage throughout the microtubule by active extraction of tubulin heterodimers. These damage sites are repaired spontaneously by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e triphosphate (GTP)–tubulin incorporation, which rejuvenates and stabilizes the microtubule shaft. Consequently, spastin and katanin increase microtubule rescue rates. Furthermore, newly severed ends emerge with a high density of GTP-tubulin that protects them against depolymerization. The stabilization of the newly severed plus ends and the higher rescue frequency synergize to amplify microtubule number and mass. Thus, severing enzymes regulate microtubule architecture and dynamics by promoting GTP-tubulin incorporation within the microtubule shaft.</p>

Phase separation focuses DNA sensing
<p>The presence of any double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytosol is a potent trigger for the activation of innate immune responses. In the context of an infection, immunorecognition of “foreign” dsDNA serves as a central host strategy to detect the presence of pathogens. Under certain conditions, however, sensing of aberrant cytosolic self-dsDNA can also promote destructive inflammation in autoinflammatory diseases. A fundamental question is how cells spatially organize and biochemically regulate the recognition of intracellular dsDNA in the vast cytosolic space of a cell. On page 704 in this issue, Du and Chen (<i>1</i>) introduce an elegant explanation by demonstrating that phase separation of the dsDNA sensor cGAS [cyclic GMP (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e monophosphate)–AMP (adenosine monophosphate) synthase] enables this central task.

Metabolite regulates differentiation
<p>Cellular differentiation involves dynamic epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic remodeling as cells transition to a new identity. Evidence is mounting that metabolism and gene regulation are intimately linked, with changes in metabolite availability modulating or even triggering gene transcription. One way that metabolites regulate gene expression is as substrates of enzymes that carry out posttranslational modification of transcription factors and histones. Such metabolites likely have distinct biological roles in different compartments of the cell, and in particular within the nucleus (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). Yet, the extent to which the nucleus is a separate metabolic compartment from the cytosol and the mechanisms by which nuclear metabolite levels affect expression of specific genes have remained largely unknown. On page 618 of this issue, Ryu <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that compartmentalized synthesis of the metabolite oxidized nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), regulates adipocyte differentiation, a process that is essential for metabolic health, through transcriptional control.</p>

Fatty acyl recognition and transfer by an integral membrane <i>S</i>-acyltransferase

We present crystal structures of two DHHC palmitoyltransferases and a covalent intermediate mimic. The active site resides at the membrane-cytosol interface, which allows the enzyme to catalyze thioester-exchange chemistry by using fatty acyl–coenzyme A and explains why membrane-proximal cysteines are candidates for palmitoylation. The acyl chain binds in a cavity formed by the transmembrane domain. We propose a mechanism for acyl chain–length selectivity in DHHC enzymes on the basis of cavity mutants with preferences for shorter and longer acyl chains.</p>

SAMTOR is an <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway
<p>mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to multiple environmental cues. Nutrients signal via the Rag <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e triphosphatases (GTPases) to promote the localization of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. We identified SAMTOR, a previously uncharacterized protein, which inhibits mTORC1 signaling by interacting with GATOR1, the GTPase activating protein (GAP) for RagA/B. We found that the methyl donor <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine (SAM) disrupts the SAMTOR-GATOR1 complex by binding directly to SAMTOR with a dissociation constant of approximately 7 μM. In cells, methionine starvation reduces SAM levels below this dissociation constant and promotes the association of SAMTOR with GATOR1, thereby inhibiting mTORC1 signaling in a SAMTOR-dependent fashion. Methionine-induced activation of mTORC1 requires the SAM binding capacity of SAMTOR. Thus, SAMTOR is a SAM sensor that links methionine and one-carbon metabolism to mTORC1 signaling.</p>

N<sup>ε</sup>-Fatty acylation of Rho GTPases by a MARTX toxin effector
<p>The multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX) toxins are a family of large toxins that are extensively distributed in bacterial pathogens. MARTX toxins are autocatalytically cleaved to multiple effector domains, which are released into host cells to modulate the host signaling pathways. The Rho <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanosin</span></strong>e triphosphatase (GTPase) inactivation domain (RID), a conserved effector domain of MARTX toxins, is implicated in cell rounding by disrupting the host actin cytoskeleton. We found that the RID is an N<sup>ε</sup>-fatty acyltransferase that covalently modifies the lysine residues in the C-terminal polybasic region of Rho GTPases. The resulting fatty acylation inhibited Rho GTPases and disrupted Rho GTPase–mediated signaling in the host. Thus, RID can mediate the lysine N<sup>ε</sup>-fatty acylation of mammalian proteins and represents a family of toxins that harbor N-fatty acyltransferase activities in bacterial pathogens.</p>

Sterilizing immunity in the lung relies on targeting fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death
<p>Humans inhale mold conidia daily and typically experience lifelong asymptomatic clearance. Conidial germination into tissue-invasive hyphae can occur in individuals with defects in myeloid function, although the mechanism of myeloid cell–mediated immune surveillance remains unclear. By monitoring fungal physiology in vivo, we demonstrate that lung neutrophils trigger programmed cell death with apoptosis-like features in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia, the most prevalent human mold pathogen. An antiapoptotic protein, AfBIR1, opposes this process by inhibiting fungal caspase activation and DNA fragmentation in the murine lung. Genetic and pharmacologic studies indicate that AfBIR1 expression and activity underlie conidial susceptibility to NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase-dependent killing and, in turn, host susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis. Immune surveillance exploits a fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death pathway to maintain sterilizing immunity in the lung.</p>

Structural basis of the redox switches in the NAD<sup>+</sup>-reducing soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase
<p>NAD<sup>+</sup> (oxidized form of NAD:nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide)–reducing soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase (SH) is phylogenetically related to NADH (reduced form of NAD<sup>+</sup>):quinone oxidoreductase (complex I), but the geometrical arrangements of the subunits and Fe–S clusters are unclear. Here, we describe the crystal structures of SH in the oxidized and reduced states. The cluster arrangement is similar to that of complex I, but the subunits orientation is not, which supports the hypothesis that subunits evolved as prebuilt modules. The oxidized active site includes a six-coordinate Ni, which is unprecedented for hydrogenases, whose coordination geometry would prevent O<sub>2</sub> from approaching. In the reduced state showing the normal active site structure without a physiological electron acceptor, the flavin mononucleotide cofactor is dissociated, which may be caused by the oxidation state change of nearby Fe–S clusters and may suppress production of reactive oxygen species.</p>

An algal photoenzyme converts fatty acids to hydrocarbons
<p>Although many organisms capture or respond to sunlight, few enzymes are known to be driven by light. Among these are DNA photolyases and the photosynthetic reaction centers. Here, we show that the microalga <i>Chlorella variabilis</i> NC64A harbors a photoenzyme that acts in lipid metabolism. This enzyme belongs to an algae-specific clade of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family and catalyzes the decarboxylation of free fatty acids to n-alkanes or -alkenes in response to blue light. Crystal structure of the protein reveals a fatty acid–binding site in a hydrophobic tunnel leading to the light-capturing flavin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor. The decarboxylation is initiated through electron abstraction from the fatty acid by the photoexcited FAD with a quantum yield >80%. This photoenzyme, which we name fatty acid photodecarboxylase, may be useful in light-driven, bio-based production of hydrocarbons.</p>

Transcriptional activation of RagD GTPase controls mTORC1 and promotes cancer growth

We found that MiT/TFE transcription factors—master regulators of lysosomal and melanosomal biogenesis and autophagy—control mTORC1 lysosomal recruitment and activity by directly regulating the expression of RagD. In mice, this mechanism mediated adaptation to food availability after starvation and physical exercise and played an important role in cancer growth. Up-regulation of <i>MiT/TFE</i> genes in cells and tissues from patients and murine models of renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and melanoma triggered RagD-mediated mTORC1 induction, resulting in cell hyperproliferation and cancer growth.

Aggregation of the Whi3 protein, not loss of heterochromatin, causes sterility in old yeast cells
<p>In yeast, heterochromatin silencing is reported to decline in aging mother cells, causing sterility in old cells. This process is thought to reflect a decrease in the activity of the NAD<sup>+ </sup>(oxidized nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide)–dependent deacetylase Sir2. We tested whether Sir2 becomes nonfunctional gradually or precipitously during aging. Unexpectedly, silencing of the heterochromatic <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> loci was not lost during aging. Old cells could initiate a mating response; however, they were less sensitive to mating pheromone than were young cells because of age-dependent aggregation of Whi3, an RNA-binding protein controlling S-phase entry. Removing the polyglutamine domain of Whi3 restored the pheromone sensitivity of old cells. We propose that aging phenotypes previously attributed to loss of heterochromatin silencing are instead caused by aggregation of the Whi3 cell cycle regulator.</p>

The molecular mechanisms underlying PARP-1–dependent cell death involve release of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and its translocation to the nucleus, which results in chromatinolysis. We identified macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as a PARP-1–dependent AIF-associated nuclease (PAAN). AIF was required for recruitment of MIF to the nucleus, where MIF cleaves genomic DNA into large fragments. Depletion of MIF, disruption of the AIF-MIF interaction, or mutation of glutamic acid at position 22 in the catalytic nuclease domain blocked MIF nuclease activity and inhibited chromatinolysis, cell death induced by glutamate excitotoxicity, and focal stroke. Inhibition of MIF’s nuclease activity is a potential therapeutic target for diseases caused by excessive PARP-1 activation.</p>

The Coumarin Glucoside, Esculin, Reveals Rapid Changes in Phloem-Transport Velocity in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>The study of phloem transport and its vital roles in long-distance communication and carbon allocation have been hampered by a lack of suitable tools that allow high-throughput, real-time studies. Esculin, a fluorescent coumarin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glucosid</span></strong>e, is recognized by Suc transporters, including AtSUC2, which loads it into the phloem for translocation to sink tissues. These properties make it an ideal tool for use in live-imaging experiments, where it acts as a surrogate for Suc. Here, we show that esculin is translocated with a similar efficiency to Suc and, because of its ease of application and detection, demonstrate that it is an ideal tool for in vivo studies of phloem transport. We used esculin to determine the effect of different environmental cues on the velocity of phloem transport. We provide evidence that fluctuations in cotyledon Suc levels influence phloem velocity rapidly, supporting the pressure-flow model of phloem transport. Under acute changes in light levels, the phloem velocity mirrored changes in the expression of <i>AtSUC2</i>. This observation suggests that under certain environmental conditions, transcriptional regulation may affect the abundance of AtSUC2 and thus regulate the phloem transport velocity.</p>

We detected the active state of extracellular α-glycosidases such as α-xylosidase XYL1, which acts on xyloglucans in the cell wall to promote cell expansion, and α-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glucosid</span></strong>ase AGLU1, which acts in starch hydrolysis and can suppress fungal invasion. Labeling of α-glycosidases generates pH-dependent signals that can be suppressed by α-glycosidase inhibitors in a broad range of plant species. To demonstrate its use on a nonmodel plant species, we applied ABPP on saffron crocus (<i>Crocus sativus</i>), a cash crop for the production of saffron spice. Using a combination of biotinylated glycosidase probes, we identified and quantified 67 active glycosidases in saffron crocus stigma, of which 10 are differentially active. We also uncovered massive changes in hydrolase activities in the corms upon infection with <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> using multiplex fluorescence labeling in combination with probes for serine hydrolases and cysteine proteases. These experiments demonstrate the ease with which active α-glycosidases and other hydrolases can be analyzed through ABPP in model and nonmodel plants.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of the Arabidopsis Replication Timing Program
<p>Eukaryotes use a temporally regulated process, known as the replication timing program, to ensure that their genomes are fully and accurately duplicated during S phase. Replication timing programs are predictive of genomic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of chromatin organization. Although replication timing programs have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to genome sequence and chromatin structure. We used the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thymidin</span></strong>e analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the genome-wide replication timing program for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified genomic regions that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and correlated these regions with genomic features and with data for chromatin state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis chromosome arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric regions replicate late. Early and mid-replicating regions are gene-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late regions are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of chromatin states across the different times is complex, with each replication time corresponding to a mixture of states. Early and mid-replicating sequences interact with each other and not with late sequences, but early regions are more accessible than mid regions. The replication timing program in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite genomic organization with early/mid-replicating regions and late regions forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated largely by chromatin accessibility.</p>

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Phenotypic rescue of a <i>Drosophila</i> model of mitochondrial ANT1 disease
<p>A point mutation in the <i>Drosophila</i> gene that codes for the major adult isoform of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e nuclear translocase (ANT) represents a model for human diseases that are associated with ANT insufficiency [<i>stress-sensitive B<sup>1</sup></i> (<i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i>)]. We characterized the organismal, bioenergetic and molecular phenotype of <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies then tested strategies to compensate the mutant phenotype. In addition to developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures, <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies have an impaired response to sound, defective male courtship, female sterility and curtailed lifespan. These phenotypes, excluding the latter two, are shared with the mito<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribos</span></strong>omal protein S12 mutant, <i>tko<sup>25t</sup></i>. Mitochondria from <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults showed a decreased respiratory control ratio and downregulation of cytochrome oxidase. <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults exhibited ATP depletion, lactate accumulation and changes in gene expression that were consistent with a metabolic shift towards glycolysis, characterized by activation of lactate dehydrogenase and anaplerotic pathways. Females also showed downregulation of many genes that are required for oogenesis, and their eggs, although fertilized, failed to develop to the larval stages. The <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> phenotypes of developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures were alleviated by an altered mitochondrial DNA background. Female sterility was substantially rescued by somatic expression of alternative oxidase (AOX) from the sea squirt <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>, whereas AOX did not alleviate developmental delay. Our findings illustrate the potential of different therapeutic strategies for ANT-linked diseases, based on alleviating metabolic stress.</p>

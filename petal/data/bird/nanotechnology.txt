A Nanoparticle-Based Combination Chemotherapy Delivery System for Enhanced Tumor Killing by Dynamic Rewiring of Signaling Pathways
<sec><title>Timing the One-Two Punch</title><p>Morton <i>et al</i>. developed a dual-drug, time-delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e delivery system for treating cancer. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es contained two drugs (one in the membrane and one in the center) and were coated to target the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es to cancer cells. Cancer cells took up the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es. The first drug quickly escaped the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e, sensitizing the cells to the second drug, which escaped more slowly. In mice, tumors from cells that respond to the first drug were reduced when the mice were treated with the dual-drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es, but the tumors continued to grow in mice receiving only single-drug therapy. This time-delayed, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e-mediated drug delivery may avoid the resistance that cancer cells develop to chemotherapy.</p></sec>

Photonic crystals for nano-light in moiré graphene superlattices
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e is an atomically thin plasmonic medium that supports highly confined plasmon polaritons, or nano-light, with very low loss. Electronic properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e can be drastically altered when it is laid upon another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e layer, resulting in a moiré superlattice. The relative twist angle between the two layers is a key tuning parameter of the interlayer coupling in thus-obtained twisted bilayer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e (TBG). We studied the propagation of plasmon polaritons in TBG by infrared nano-imaging. We discovered that the atomic reconstruction occurring at small twist angles transforms the TBG into a natural plasmon photonic crystal for propagating nano-light. This discovery points to a pathway for controlling nano-light by exploiting quantum properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e and other atomically layered van der Waals materials, eliminating the need for arduous top-down <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanofabr</span></strong>ication.</p>

Real-time imaging of adatom-promoted graphene growth on nickel
<p>Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adatom</span></strong>s are expected to participate in many processes occurring at solid surfaces, such as the growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e on metals. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, the catalytic role played by single metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adatom</span></strong>s during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>ically relevant process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e growth on nickel (Ni). The catalytic action of individual Ni atoms at the edges of a growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e flake was directly captured by scanning tunneling microscopy imaging at the millisecond time scale, while force field molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations rationalize the experimental observations.

When early adopters don't adopt
<p>Individuals who naturally adopt a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>y early are important for influencing whether and how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>y diffuses more broadly among later users (<i>1</i>–<i>7</i>). Such natural early adopters (NEAs) may influence the difference between successful diffusion of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>y and failure. Yet the factors that most influence how and why NEAs engage with new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>ies are not entirely understood. We asked, “What if natural early adopters are not able to adopt early?” This paper is the first to measure the counterfactual diffusion curve that occurs when NEAs are not allowed to adopt early. The results suggest that NEAs can stifle broader diffusion of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>y if their usual ability to be first—and to derive value from being first—is compromised. Small changes in the initial availability of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>y among different types of users can have a lasting effect on its potential.</p>

Carbon nanotube transistors scaled to a 40-nanometer footprint
<p>The International <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>y Roadmap for Semiconductors challenges the device research community to reduce the transistor footprint containing all components to 40 nanometers within the next decade. We report on a p-channel transistor scaled to such an extremely small dimension. Built on one semiconducting carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>e, it occupies less than half the space of leading silicon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>ies, while delivering a significantly higher pitch-normalized current density—above 0.9 milliampere per micrometer at a low supply voltage of 0.5 volts with a subthreshold swing of 85 millivolts per decade. Furthermore, we show transistors with the same small footprint built on actual high-density arrays of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>es that deliver higher current than that of the best-competing silicon devices under the same overdrive, without any normalization. We achieve this using low-resistance end-bonded contacts, a high-purity semiconducting carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>e source, and self-assembly to pack <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>es into full surface-coverage aligned arrays.</p>

Quantitative 3D evolution of colloidal nanoparticle oxidation in solution
<p>Real-time tracking of the three-dimensional (3D) evolution of colloidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es in solution is essential for understanding complex mechanisms involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e growth and transformation. We used time-resolved small-angle and wide-angle x-ray scattering simultaneously to monitor oxidation of highly uniform colloidal iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es, enabling the reconstruction of intermediate 3D morphologies of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es with a spatial resolution of <i>~</i>5 angstroms. The in situ observations, combined with large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations, reveal the details of the transformation from solid metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es to hollow metal oxide nanoshells via a nanoscale Kirkendall process—for example, coalescence of voids as they grow and reversal of mass diffusion direction depending on crystallinity. Our results highlight the complex interplay between defect chemistry and defect dynamics in determining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e transformation and formation.</p>

Tunable intraparticle frameworks for creating complex heterostructured nanoparticle libraries
<p>Complex heterostructured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es with precisely defined materials and interfaces are important for many applications. However, rationally incorporating such features into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es with rigorous morphology control remains a synthetic bottleneck. We define a modular divergent synthesis strategy that progressively transforms simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e synthons into increasingly sophisticated products. We introduce a series of tunable interfaces into zero-, one-, and two-dimensional copper sulfide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es using cation exchange reactions. Subsequent manipulation of these intraparticle frameworks yielded a library of 47 distinct heterostructured metal sulfide derivatives, including particles that contain asymmetric, patchy, porous, and sculpted nanoarchitectures. This generalizable mix-and-match strategy provides predictable retrosynthetic pathways to complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e features that are otherwise inaccessible.</p>

Carbothermal shock synthesis of high-entropy-alloy nanoparticles

Enhanced water permeability and tunable ion selectivity in subnanometer carbon nanotube porins
<p>Fast water transport through carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>e pores has raised the possibility to use them in the next generation of water treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>ies. We report that water permeability in 0.8-nanometer-diameter carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>e porins (CNTPs), which confine water down to a single-file chain, exceeds that of biological water transporters and of wider CNT pores by an order of magnitude. Intermolecular hydrogen-bond rearrangement, required for entry into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>e, dominates the energy barrier and can be manipulated to enhance water transport rates. CNTPs block anion transport, even at salinities that exceed seawater levels, and their ion selectivity can be tuned to configure them into switchable ionic diodes. These properties make CNTPs a promising material for developing membrane separation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>ies.</p>

Transformation of bulk alloys to oxide nanowires
<p>One dimensional (1D) nanostructures offer prospects for enhancing the electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties of a broad range of functional materials and composites, but their synthesis methods are typically elaborate and expensive. We demonstrate a direct transformation of bulk materials into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es under ambient conditions without the use of catalysts or any external stimuli. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es form via minimization of strain energy at the boundary of a chemical reaction front. We show the transformation of multimicrometer-sized particles of aluminum or magnesium alloys into alkoxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es of tunable dimensions, which are converted into oxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es upon heating in air. Fabricated separators based on aluminum oxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es enhanced the safety and rate capabilities of lithium-ion batteries. The reported approach allows ultralow-cost scalable synthesis of 1D materials and membranes.</p>

Emergence of hierarchical structural complexities in nanoparticles and their assembly

The precise assembly structures of gold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es (246 gold core atoms with 80 <i>p</i>-methylbenzenethiolate surface ligands) at the atomic, molecular, and nanoscale levels were determined from x-ray diffraction studies. We identified the driving forces and rules that guide the multiscale assembly behavior. The protecting ligands self-organize into rotational and parallel patterns on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e surface via C-H⋅⋅⋅π interaction, and the symmetry and density of surface patterns dictate directional packing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es into crystals with orientational, rotational, and translational orders. Through hierarchical interactions and symmetry matching, the simple building blocks evolve into complex structures, representing an emergent phenomenon in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e system.</p>

Ultrafine jagged platinum nanowires enable ultrahigh mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction
<p>Improving the platinum (Pt) mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) requires optimization of both the specific activity and the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). We found that solution-synthesized Pt/NiO core/shell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es can be converted into PtNi alloy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es through a thermal annealing process and then transformed into jagged Pt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es via electrochemical dealloying.

Reactive molecular dynamics simulations suggest that highly stressed, undercoordinated rhombus-rich surface configurations of the jagged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es enhance ORR activity versus more relaxed surfaces.</p>

A nanoscale reorganization of the IL-15 receptor is triggered by NKG2D in a ligand-dependent manner
<p>Natural killer group 2D (NKG2D), an activating receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and a subset of T cells, recognizes stress-inducible proteins, including MICA and ULBP2, which are present on infected or transformed cells. Whether each NKG2D ligand (NKG2DL) has a distinct biological role is not clear. Using superresolution microscopy, we found that NKG2D is constitutively arranged in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoclust</span></strong>ers at the surface of human primary NK cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoclust</span></strong>ers of NKG2D became smaller upon ligation with MICA but became larger upon activation by ULBP2. In addition, ULBP2 induced the reorganization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoclust</span></strong>ers of the cytokine receptor subunit for both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-15 (IL-2/IL-15Rβ), such that these cytokine receptor subunits coalesced with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoclust</span></strong>ers of NKG2D. Functionally, the response of NK cells activated by ULBP2 was augmented by an interaction between ULBP2-bound NKG2D and IL-15R ligated by IL-15 (trans-presented by IL-15Rα–coated surfaces). These data suggest that NKG2DLs are not equivalent in their capacity to activate NKG2D and establish a previously unknown paradigm in how ligand-induced changes to the nanoscale organization of the cell surface can affect immune responses.</p>

A general synthesis approach for supported bimetallic nanoparticles via surface inorganometallic chemistry
<p>The synthesis of ultrasmall supported bimetallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es (between 1 and 3 nanometers in diameter) with well-defined stoichiometry and intimacy between constituent metals remains a substantial challenge. We synthesized 10 different supported bimetallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es via surface inorganometallic chemistry by decomposing and reducing surface-adsorbed heterometallic double complex salts, which are readily obtained upon sequential adsorption of target cations and anions on a silica substrate. For example, adsorption of tetraamminepalladium(II) [Pd(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub><sup>2+</sup>] followed by adsorption of tetrachloroplatinate [PtCl<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>] was used to form palladium-platinum (Pd-Pt) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es.

Chiromagnetic nanoparticles and gels
<p>Chiral inorganic nanostructures have high circular dichroism, but real-time control of their optical activity has so far been achieved only by irreversible chemical changes. Field modulation is a far more desirable path to chiroptical devices. We hypothesized that magnetic field modulation can be attained for chiral nanostructures with large contributions of the magnetic transition dipole moments to polarization rotation. We found that dispersions and gels of paramagnetic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es with chiral distortions of the crystal lattices exhibited chiroptical activity in the visible range that was 10 times as strong as that of nonparamagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es of comparable size. Transparency of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e gels to circularly polarized light beams in the ultraviolet range was reversibly modulated by magnetic fields. These phenomena were also observed for other nanoscale metal oxides with lattice distortions from imprinted amino acids and other chiral ligands.

Common synthesis techniques for this type of material often result in large, unalloyed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es that lack the interactions between the two metals that give the particles their desired characteristics.

Femtosecond laser reshaping yields gold nanorods with ultranarrow surface plasmon resonances
<p>The irradiation of gold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanorod</span></strong> colloids with a femtosecond laser can be tuned to induce controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanorod</span></strong> reshaping, yielding colloids with exceptionally narrow localized surface plasmon resonance bands. The process relies on a regime characterized by a gentle multishot reduction of the aspect ratio, whereas the rod shape and volume are barely affected. Successful reshaping can only occur within a narrow window of the heat dissipation rate: Low cooling rates lead to drastic morphological changes, and fast cooling has nearly no effect. Hence, a delicate balance must be achieved between irradiation fluence and surface density of the surfactant on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanorod</span></strong>s. This perfection process is appealing because it provides a simple, fast, reproducible, and scalable route toward gold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanorod</span></strong>s with an optical response of exceptional quality, near the theoretical limit.</p>

The ABS/MBS spectra provide parameters that are useful for understanding topological superconductivity in this system.</p>

Quantum-critical conductivity of the Dirac fluid in graphene

<p>In vaccine design, antigens are often arrayed in a multivalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e form, but in vivo mechanisms underlying the enhanced immunity elicited by such vaccines remain poorly understood. We compared the fates of two different heavily glycosylated HIV antigens, a gp120-derived mini-protein and a large, stabilized envelope trimer, in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e or “free” forms after primary immunization. Unlike monomeric antigens, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es were rapidly shuttled to the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network and then concentrated in germinal centers in a complement-, mannose-binding lectin (MBL)–, and immunogen glycan–dependent manner. Loss of FDC localization in MBL-deficient mice or via immunogen deglycosylation significantly affected antibody responses. These findings identify an innate immune–mediated recognition pathway promoting antibody responses to particulate antigens, with broad implications for humoral immunity and vaccine design.</p>

Probing the ultimate plasmon confinement limits with a van der Waals heterostructure
<p>The ability to confine light into tiny spatial dimensions is important for applications such as microscopy, sensing, and nanoscale lasers. Although plasmons offer an appealing avenue to confine light, Landau damping in metals imposes a trade-off between optical field confinement and losses. We show that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e-insulator-metal heterostructure can overcome that trade-off, and demonstrate plasmon confinement down to the ultimate limit of the length scale of one atom. This is achieved through far-field excitation of plasmon modes squeezed into an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride dielectric spacer between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e and metal rods. A theoretical model that takes into account the nonlocal optical response of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e and metal is used to describe the results. These ultraconfined plasmonic modes, addressed with far-field light excitation, enable a route to new regimes of ultrastrong light-matter interactions.</p>

Multidimensional quantum entanglement with large-scale integrated optics
<p>The ability to control multidimensional quantum systems is central to the development of advanced quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>ies. We demonstrate a multidimensional integrated quantum photonic platform able to generate, control, and analyze high-dimensional entanglement. A programmable bipartite entangled system is realized with dimensions up to 15 × 15 on a large-scale silicon photonics quantum circuit. The device integrates more than 550 photonic components on a single chip, including 16 identical photon-pair sources. We verify the high precision, generality, and controllability of our multidimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>y, and further exploit these abilities to demonstrate previously unexplored quantum applications, such as quantum randomness expansion and self-testing on multidimensional states.

Bottom-up synthesis of multifunctional nanoporous graphene
<p>Nanosize pores can turn semimetallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e into a semiconductor and, from being impermeable, into the most efficient molecular-sieve membrane. However, scaling the pores down to the nanometer, while fulfilling the tight structural constraints imposed by applications, represents an enormous challenge for present top-down strategies. Here we report a bottom-up method to synthesize nanoporous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e comprising an ordered array of pores separated by ribbons, which can be tuned down to the 1-nanometer range. The size, density, morphology, and chemical composition of the pores are defined with atomic precision by the design of the molecular precursors. Our electronic characterization further reveals a highly anisotropic electronic structure, where orthogonal one-dimensional electronic bands with an energy gap of ∼1 electron volt coexist with confined pore states, making the nanoporous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e a highly versatile semiconductor for simultaneous sieving and electrical sensing of molecular species.</p>

Building superlattices from individual nanoparticles via template-confined DNA-mediated assembly
<p>DNA programmable assembly has been combined with top-down lithography to construct superlattices of discrete, reconfigurable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e architectures on a gold surface over large areas. Specifically, the assembly of individual colloidal plasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es with different shapes and sizes is controlled by oligonucleotides containing “locked” nucleic acids and confined environments provided by polymer pores to yield oriented architectures that feature tunable arrangements and independently controllable distances at both nanometer- and micrometer-length scales. These structures, which would be difficult to construct by other common assembly methods, provide a platform to systematically study and control light-matter interactions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e-based optical materials. The generality and potential of this approach are explored by identifying a broadband absorber with a solvent polarity response that allows dynamic tuning of visible light absorption.</p>

An on/off Berry phase switch in circular graphene resonators
<p>The phase of a quantum state may not return to its original value after the system’s parameters cycle around a closed path; instead, the wave function may acquire a measurable phase difference called the Berry phase. Berry phases typically have been accessed through interference experiments. Here, we demonstrate an unusual Berry phase–induced spectroscopic feature: a sudden and large increase in the energy of angular-momentum states in circular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e p-n junction resonators when a relatively small critical magnetic field is reached. This behavior results from turning on a π Berry phase associated with the topological properties of Dirac fermions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e. The Berry phase can be switched on and off with small magnetic field changes on the order of 10 millitesla, potentially enabling a variety of optoelectronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e device applications.</p>

Three-dimensional holey-graphene/niobia composite architectures for ultrahigh-rate energy storage
<p>Nanostructured materials have shown extraordinary promise for electrochemical energy storage but are usually limited to electrodes with rather low mass loading (~1 milligram per square centimeter) because of the increasing ion diffusion limitations in thicker electrodes. We report the design of a three-dimensional (3D) holey-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e/niobia (Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) composite for ultrahigh-rate energy storage at practical levels of mass loading (>10 milligrams per square centimeter). The highly interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e network in the 3D architecture provides excellent electron transport properties, and its hierarchical porous structure facilitates rapid ion transport. By systematically tailoring the porosity in the holey <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e backbone, charge transport in the composite architecture is optimized to deliver high areal capacity and high-rate capability at high mass loading, which represents a critical step forward toward practical applications.</p>

We have extended 4D EM to include liquid cells without the time resolution being limited by the response of the detector. Our approach permits the imaging of the motion and morphological dynamics of a single, same particle on nanometer and ultrashort time scales. As a first application, we studied the rotational dynamics of gold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es in aqueous solution. A full transition from the conventional diffusive rotation to superdiffusive rotation and further to a ballistic rotation was observed with increasing asymmetry of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e morphology.

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons transmitted across a ballistic semiconductor junction are expected to undergo refraction, analogous to light rays across an optical boundary. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e, the linear dispersion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the propagation of carriers across an electrostatically defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell’s law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative refraction. Resonant transmission across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent transmission coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design.

In both single-gene and multiple-gene silencing, we observed an overall improvement in performance by amiRNAs designed using our strategy in Arabidopsis protoplasts and transgenic plants. In addition, the endogenous tRNA-processing system was used to generate multiple amiRNAs from tRNA-pre-amiRNA tandem repeats for multiplex gene silencing. An intronic amiRNA-producing fluorescent reporter was explored as a visual screening strategy for transgenic Arabidopsis and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) plants with maximal whole-plant or cell type-specific gene silencing.

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops

Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>ies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-based Plant Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">technolog</span></strong>y was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es observed in xylem sap via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e-tracking analysis included surfactant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Near-infrared deep brain stimulation via upconversion nanoparticle–mediated optogenetics

The earliest modern humans outside Africa

Purcell effect for active tuning of light scattering from semiconductor optical antennas

Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency.

Epitaxial lift-off of electrodeposited single-crystal gold foils for flexible electronics
<p>We introduce a simple and inexpensive procedure for epitaxial lift-off of wafer-size flexible and transparent foils of single-crystal gold using silicon as a template. Lateral electrochemical undergrowth of a sacrificial SiO<i><sub>x</sub></i> layer was achieved by photoelectrochemically oxidizing silicon under light irradiation. A 28-nanometer-thick gold foil with a sheet resistance of 7 ohms per square showed only a 4% increase in resistance after 4000 bending cycles. A flexible organic light-emitting diode based on tris(bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) that was spin-coated on a foil exploited the transmittance and flexibility of the gold foil. Cuprous oxide as an inorganic semiconductor that was epitaxially electrodeposited onto the gold foils exhibited a diode quality factor <i>n</i> of 1.6 (where <i>n</i> = 1.0 for an ideal diode), compared with a value of 3.1 for a polycrystalline deposit. Zinc oxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es electrodeposited epitaxially on a gold foil also showed flexibility, with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es intact up to 500 bending cycles.</p>

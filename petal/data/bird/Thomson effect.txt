Two-channel model for ultralow thermal conductivity of crystalline Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>
<p>Solids with ultralow thermal conductivity are of great interest as thermal barrier coatings for insulation or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermoelectr</span></strong>ics for energy conversion. However, the theoretical limits of lattice thermal conductivity (κ) are unclear. In typical crystals a phonon picture is valid, whereas lowest κ values occur in highly disordered materials where this picture fails and heat is supposedly carried by random walk among uncorrelated oscillators. Here we identify a simple crystal, Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>, with a calculated phonon κ [0.16 Watts per meter-Kelvin (W/m-K)] one-half that of our measured κ (0.30 W/m-K) at 300 K, approaching disorder κ values, although Raman spectra, specific heat, and temperature dependence of κ reveal typical phonon characteristics. Adding a transport component based on uncorrelated oscillators explains the measured κ and suggests that a two-channel model is necessary for crystals with ultralow κ.</p>

3D charge and 2D phonon transports leading to high out-of-plane <i>ZT</i> in n-type SnSe crystals
<p>Thermoelectric technology enables the harvest of waste heat and its direct conversion into electricity. The conversion efficiency is determined by the materials figure of merit <i>ZT</i>. Here we show a maximum <i>ZT</i> of ~2.8 ± 0.5 at 773 kelvin in n-type tin selenide (SnSe) crystals out of plane. The thermal conductivity in layered SnSe crystals is the lowest in the out-of-plane direction [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport]. We doped SnSe with bromine to make n-type SnSe crystals with the overlapping interlayer charge density (3D charge transport). A continuous phase transition increases the symmetry and diverges two converged conduction bands. These two factors improve carrier mobility, while preserving a large Seebeck coefficient. Our findings can be applied in 2D layered materials and provide a new strategy to enhance out-of-plane electrical transport properties without degrading thermal properties.</p>

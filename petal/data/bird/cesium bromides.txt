Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cesium</span></strong> lead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bromid</span></strong>e (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin coating either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

An enantioconvergent halogenophilic nucleophilic substitution (S<sub>N</sub>2X) reaction
<p>Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S<sub>N</sub>2) plays a central role in organic chemistry. In the conventionally accepted mechanism, the nucleophile displaces a carbon-bound leaving group X, often a halogen, by attacking the carbon face opposite the C–X bond. A less common variant, the halogenophilic S<sub>N</sub>2X reaction, involves initial nucleophilic attack of the X group from the front and as such is less sensitive to backside steric hindrance. Herein, we report an enantioconvergent substitution reaction of activated tertiary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bromid</span></strong>es by thiocarboxylates or azides that, on the basis of experimental and computational mechanistic studies, appears to proceed via the unusual S<sub>N</sub>2X pathway. The proposed electrophilic intermediates, benzoylsulfenyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bromid</span></strong>e and bromine azide, were independently synthesized and shown to be effective.</p>

Chloride Sensing by WNK1 Involves Inhibition of Autophosphorylation
<sec><title>Inhibited by Chloride in the Active Site</title><p>Chloride ions are essential for regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. Kinases of the WNK family are involved in the phosphorylation-mediated regulation of chloride cotransporters and ion channels involved in salt regulation; mutations in <i>WNK1</i> or <i>WNK4</i> produce hypertension, hyperkalemia, and hyperchloremia. Piala <i>et al</i>. found that chloride ions stabilized the WNK1 kinase domain and inhibited its autophosphorylation activity and kinase activity toward substrates. Analysis of crystal structures of the kinase domain with either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bromid</span></strong>e or chloride revealed that the ion bound in the catalytic site, and mutation of the residues involved in binding the ion rendered the kinase less sensitive to inhibition of autophosphorylation activity by chloride salts. Thus, these results provide a molecular explanation for how these kinases function as sensors of intracellular chloride.</p></sec>

Homogenized halides and alkali cation segregation in alloyed organic-inorganic perovskites
<p>The role of the alkali metal cations in halide perovskite solar cells is not well understood. Using synchrotron-based nano–x-ray fluorescence and complementary measurements, we found that the halide distribution becomes homogenized upon addition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cesium</span></strong> iodide, either alone or with rubidium iodide, for substoichiometric, stoichiometric, and overstoichiometric preparations, where the lead halide is varied with respect to organic halide precursors. Halide homogenization coincides with long-lived charge carrier decays, spatially homogeneous carrier dynamics (as visualized by ultrafast microscopy), and improved photovoltaic device performance. We found that rubidium and potassium phase-segregate in highly concentrated clusters. Alkali metals are beneficial at low concentrations, where they homogenize the halide distribution, but at higher concentrations, they form recombination-active second-phase clusters.</p>

Methylammonium-free, high-performance, and stable perovskite solar cells on a planar architecture
<p>Currently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high performances greater than 20% contain bromine (Br), causing a suboptimal bandgap, and the thermally unstable methylammonium (MA) molecule. Avoiding Br and especially MA can therefore result in more optimal bandgaps and stable perovskites. We show that inorganic cation tuning, using rubidium and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cesium</span></strong>, enables highly crystalline formamidinium-based perovskites without Br or MA. On a conventional, planar device architecture, using polymeric interlayers at the electron- and hole-transporting interface, we demonstrate an efficiency of 20.35% (stabilized), one of the highest for MA-free perovskites, with a drastically improved stability reached without the stabilizing influence of mesoporous interlayers. The perovskite is not heated beyond 100°C. Going MA-free is a new direction for perovskites that are inherently stable and compatible with tandems or flexible substrates, which are the main routes commercializing PSCs.</p>

A radical approach to the copper oxidative addition problem: Trifluoromethylation of bromoarenes
<p>Transition metal–catalyzed arene functionalization has been widely used for molecular synthesis over the past century. In this arena, copper catalysis has long been considered a privileged platform due to the propensity of high-valent copper to undergo reductive elimination with a wide variety of coupling fragments. However, the sluggish nature of oxidative addition has limited copper’s capacity to broadly facilitate haloarene coupling protocols. Here, we demonstrate that this copper oxidative addition problem can be overcome with an aryl radical–capture mechanism, wherein the aryl radical is generated through a silyl radical halogen abstraction. This strategy was applied to a general trifluoromethylation of aryl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bromid</span></strong>es through dual copper-photoredox catalysis. Mechanistic studies support the formation of an open-shell aryl species.</p>

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms
<p>Chemical reactions typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants. Going beyond this paradigm, we combined exactly two atoms in a single, controlled reaction. The experimental apparatus traps two individual laser-cooled atoms [one sodium (Na) and one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cesium</span></strong> (Cs)] in separate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociation forms an excited-state NaCs molecule. The discovery of previously unseen resonances near the molecular dissociation threshold and measurement of collision rates are enabled by the tightly trapped ultracold sample of atoms. As laser-cooling and trapping capabilities are extended to more elements, the technique will enable the study of more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules in an isolated environment, as well as synthesis of designer molecules for qubits.</p>

Asymmetric nucleophilic fluorination under hydrogen bonding phase-transfer catalysis
<p>Common anionic nucleophiles such as those derived from inorganic salts have not been used for enantioselective catalysis because of their insolubility. Here, we report that merging hydrogen bonding and phase-transfer catalysis provides an effective mode of activation for nucleophiles that are insoluble in organic solvents. This catalytic manifold relies on hydrogen bonding complexation to render nucleophiles soluble and reactive, while simultaneously inducing asymmetry in the ensuing transformation. We demonstrate the concept using a chiral bis-urea catalyst to form a tridentate hydrogen bonding complex with fluoride from its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cesium</span></strong> salt, thereby enabling highly efficient enantioselective ring opening of episulfonium ion. This fluorination method is synthetically valuable considering the scarcity of alternative protocols and points the way to wider application of the catalytic approach with diverse anionic nucleophiles.</p>

Measurement of the fine-structure constant as a test of the Standard Model
<p>Measurements of the fine-structure constant α require methods from across subfields and are thus powerful tests of the consistency of theory and experiment in physics. Using the recoil frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cesium</span></strong>-133 atoms in a matter-wave interferometer, we recorded the most accurate measurement of the fine-structure constant to date: α = 1/137.035999046(27) at 2.0 × 10<sup>−10</sup> accuracy. Using multiphoton interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-Bordé interferometer and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 part per billion. Comparison with Penning trap measurements of the electron gyromagnetic anomaly <i>g<sub>e</sub></i> − 2 via the Standard Model of particle physics is now limited by the uncertainty in <i>g<sub>e</sub></i> − 2; a 2.5σ tension rejects dark photons as the reason for the unexplained part of the muon’s magnetic moment at a 99% confidence level. Implications for dark-sector candidates and electron substructure may be a sign of physics beyond the Standard Model that warrants further investigation.</p>

Screening in crystalline liquids protects energetic carriers in hybrid perovskites
<p>Hybrid lead halide perovskites exhibit carrier properties that resemble those of pristine nonpolar semiconductors despite static and dynamic disorder, but how carriers are protected from efficient scattering with charged defects and optical phonons is unknown. Here, we reveal the carrier protection mechanism by comparing three single-crystal lead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bromid</span></strong>e perovskites: CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>, CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>, and CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>. We observed hot fluorescence emission from energetic carriers with ~10<sup>2</sup>-picosecond lifetimes in CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub> or CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>, but not in CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>. The hot fluorescence is correlated with liquid-like molecular reorientational motions, suggesting that dynamic screening protects energetic carriers via solvation or large polaron formation on time scales competitive with that of ultrafast cooling. Similar protections likely exist for band-edge carriers. The long-lived energetic carriers may enable hot-carrier solar cells with efficiencies exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit.</p>

Circular Noncoding RNA HIPK3 Mediates Retinal Vascular Dysfunction in Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The vascular complications of diabetes mellitus are the major causes of morbidity and mortality among people with diabetes. Circular RNAs are a class of endogenous noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. In this study, we investigated the role of circular RNA in retinal vascular dysfunction induced by diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Quantitative polymerase chain reactions, Sanger sequencing, and Northern blots were conducted to detect circular HIPK3 (circHIPK3) expression pattern on diabetes mellitus–related stresses. MTT (3-[4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bromid</span></strong>e) assays, EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) incorporation assays, Transwell migration assays, and Matrigel assays were conducted to detect the role of circHIPK3 in retinal endothelial cell function in vitro. Retinal trypsin digestion, vascular permeability assays, and ELISA assays were conducted to detect the role of circHIPK3 in retinal vascular dysfunction in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase activity assays, RNA pull-down assays, and in vitro studies were conducted to reveal the mechanism of circHIPK3-mediated retinal vascular dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>circHIPK3 expression was significantly upregulated in diabetic retinas and retinal endothelial cells following stressors related to diabetes mellitus. circHIPK3 silencing or overexpressing circHIPK3 changed retinal endothelial cell viability, proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro. circHIPK3 silencing in vivo alleviated retinal vascular dysfunction, as shown by decreased retinal acellular capillaries, vascular leakage, and inflammation. circHIPK3 acted as an endogenous miR-30a-3p sponge to sequester and inhibit miR-30a-3p activity, which led to increased vascular endothelial growth factor-C, FZD4, and WNT2 expression. Ectopic expression of miR-30a-3p mimicked the effect of circHIPK3 silencing on vascular endothelial phenotypes in vivo and in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The circular RNA circHIPK3 plays a role in diabetic retinopathy by blocking miR-30a function, leading to increased endothelial proliferation and vascular dysfunction. These data suggest that circular RNA is a potential target to control diabetic proliferative retinopathy.</p></sec>

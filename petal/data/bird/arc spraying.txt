Do antidepressants restore lost synapses?
<p>Depression is a mental illness characterized by episodes of a sad, despondent mood and/or a loss of interest or pleasure (<i>1</i>). This pathology affects nearly 20% of the population in the United States (<i>2</i>), and treatments are limited. Indeed, in the 5 years following remission, 80% of patients will endure relapse and more than 30% of patients suffer from treatment-resistant depression. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the clinical use of esketamine nasal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spray</span></strong> for depression that is resistant to other treatments (<i>3</i>). Esketamine is an enantiomer of ketamine, a drug with antidepressant properties, although its mechanism of action remains unclear. Brain imaging studies suggest that neuronal circuitry in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in the physiopathology of this disorder (<i>4</i>). On page 147 of this issue, Moda-Sava <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report that ketamine induces plasticity of dendritic spines on mPFC neurons and restores microcircuit activity and behavior in animal models of depression. This may expand therapeutic strategies for treating major depression.</p>

The patient-specific Triflange acetabular implant for revision total hip arthroplasty in patients with severe acetabular defects
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few reconstructive techniques are available for patients requiring   complex acetabular revisions such as those involving Paprosky type   2C, 3A and 3B deficiencies and pelvic discontinuity. Our aim was   to describe the development of the patient specific Triflange acetabular   component for use in these patients, the surgical technique and   mid-term results. We include a description of the pre-operative   CT scanning, the construction of a model, operative planning, and   surgical technique. All implants were coated with porous plasma   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spray</span></strong> and hydroxyapatite if desired.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A multicentre, retrospective review of 95 complex acetabular   reconstructions in 94 patients was performed. A total of 61 (64.2%)   were female. The mean age of the patients was 66 (38 to 85). The   mean body mass index was 29 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (18 to 51). Outcome   was reported using the Harris Hip Score (HHS), complications, failures   and survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 3.5 years (1 to 11). The mean HHS improved   from 46 (15 to 90)    pre-operatively to 75 (14 to 100). A total of 21 hips (22%) had   at least one complication with some having more than one; including   dislocation (6%), infection (6%), and femoral complications (2%).   The implant was subsequently removed in five hips (5%), only one   for suspected aseptic loosening.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Triflange patient specific acetabular component provides   predictable fixation with complication rates which are similar to   those of other techniques.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B(1   Supple A):50â€“4.</p></sec>

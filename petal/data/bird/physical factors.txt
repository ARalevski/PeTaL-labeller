Activity levels and return to work following total knee arthroplasty in patients under 65 years of age
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about employment following total knee arthroplasty   (TKA). This study aims to identify factors which predict return   to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> following TKA in patients of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing age in the United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients & Methods</title><p>We prospectively assessed 289 patients (289 TKAs) aged ≤ 65 years   who underwent TKA between 2010 and 2013. There were 148 women. The   following were recorded pre-operatively: age, gender, body mass   index, social deprivation, comorbidities, indication for surgery,   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> status and nature of employment, activity level as assessed by   the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score   and Oxford Knee Score (OKS). The intention of patients to return   to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> or to retire was not assessed pre-operatively. At a mean   of 3.4 years (2 to 4) post-operatively, the return to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> status,   OKS, the EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) score, UCLA activity score   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>, Osteoarthritis and joint-Replacement (WORQ) score were   obtained.

Reactivation of latent working memories with transcranial magnetic stimulation
<p>The ability to hold information in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory is fundamental for cognition. Contrary to the long-standing view that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory depends on sustained, elevated activity, we present evidence suggesting that humans can hold information in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory via “activity-silent” synaptic mechanisms. Using multivariate pattern analyses to decode brain activity patterns, we found that the active representation of an item in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory drops to baseline when attention shifts away. A targeted pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation produced a brief reemergence of the item in concurrently measured brain activity. This reactivation effect occurred and influenced memory performance only when the item was potentially relevant later in the trial, which suggests that the representation is dynamic and modifiable via cognitive control. The results support a synaptic theory of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory.</p>

Energy pulses reveal possible new state of memory
<p>Memory researchers have shone light into a cognitive limbo. A new memory—the name of someone you've just met, for example—is held for seconds in so-called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory, as your brain's neurons continue to fire. If the person is important to you, the name will over a few days enter your long-term memory, preserved by permanently altered neural connections. But where does it go during the in-between hours, when it has left your standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory and is not yet embedded in long-term memory? To figure this out, a research team resurrects memories from this limbo. Their observations point to a new form of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory, which they dub prioritized long-term memory, that exists without elevated neural activity. Consistent with other recent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>, the study suggests that information can somehow be held among the synapses that connect neurons, even after conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing memory has faded. This new memory state could have a range of practical implications, from helping college students learn more efficiently to assisting people with memory-related neurological conditions such as amnesia, epilepsy, and schizophrenia.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Effect of Childhood Obesity Prevention Programs on Blood Pressure
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Childhood overweight and obesity are associated with elevated blood pressure (BP). However, little is known about how childhood obesity lifestyle prevention programs affect BP. We assessed the effects of childhood obesity prevention programs on BP in children in developed countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We searched databases up to April 22, 2013, for relevant randomized, controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and natural experiments. Studies were included if they applied a diet or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al activity intervention(s) and were followed for ≥1 year (or ≥6 months for school-based intervention studies); they were excluded if they targeted only overweight/obese subjects or those with a medical condition. In our meta-analysis, intervention effects were calculated for systolic BP and diastolic BP with the use of weighted random-effects models. Of the 23 included intervention studies (involving 18 925 participants), 21 involved a school setting. Our meta-analysis included 19 studies reporting on systolic BP and 18 on diastolic BP. The pooled intervention effect was −1.64 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −2.56 to −0.71; <i>P</i>=0.001) for systolic BP and −1.44 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −2.28 to −0.60; <i>P</i>=0.001) for diastolic BP. The combined diet and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al activity interventions led to a significantly greater reduction in both systolic BP and diastolic BP than the diet-only or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al activity–only intervention. Thirteen interventions (46%) had a similar effect on both adiposity-related outcomes and BP, whereas 11 interventions (39%) showed a significant desirable effect on BP but not on adiposity-related outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Obesity prevention programs have a moderate effect on reducing BP, and those targeting both diet and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al activity seem to be more effective.</p></sec>

Anti–parity-time symmetry in diffusive systems
<p>Various concepts related to parity-time symmetry, including anti–parity-time symmetry, have found broad applications in wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s. Wave systems are fundamentally described by Hermitian operators, whereas their unusual properties are introduced by incorporation of gain and loss. We propose that the related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s need not be restricted to wave dynamics, and we consider systems described by diffusive dynamics. We study the heat transfer in two countermoving media and show that this system exhibits anti–parity-time symmetry. The spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a phase transition from motionless temperature profiles, despite the mechanical motion of the background, to moving temperature profiles. Our results extend the concepts of parity-time symmetry beyond wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s and may offer opportunities to manipulate heat and mass transport.</p>

Measurement of the neutron lifetime using a magneto-gravitational trap and in situ detection
<p>The precise value of the mean neutron lifetime, τ<sub>n</sub>, plays an important role in nuclear and particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s and cosmology. It is used to predict the ratio of protons to helium atoms in the primordial universe and to search for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s beyond the Standard Model of particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s. We eliminated loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by levitating polarized ultracold neutrons above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored neutrons do not interact with material trap walls. As a result of this approach and the use of an in situ neutron detector, the lifetime reported here [877.7 ± 0.7 (stat) +0.4/–0.2 (sys) seconds] does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.</p>

Measurement of the fine-structure constant as a test of the Standard Model
<p>Measurements of the fine-structure constant α require methods from across subfields and are thus powerful tests of the consistency of theory and experiment in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s. Using the recoil frequency of cesium-133 atoms in a matter-wave interferometer, we recorded the most accurate measurement of the fine-structure constant to date: α = 1/137.035999046(27) at 2.0 × 10<sup>−10</sup> accuracy. Using multiphoton interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-Bordé interferometer and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 part per billion. Comparison with Penning trap measurements of the electron gyromagnetic anomaly <i>g<sub>e</sub></i> − 2 via the Standard Model of particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s is now limited by the uncertainty in <i>g<sub>e</sub></i> − 2; a 2.5σ tension rejects dark photons as the reason for the unexplained part of the muon’s magnetic moment at a 99% confidence level.

Observation of bulk Fermi arc and polarization half charge from paired exceptional points

Moreover, we discover half-integer topological charges in the polarization of far-field radiation around the bulk Fermi arc. Both phenomena are shown to be direct consequences of the non-Hermitian topological properties of exceptional points, where resonances coincide in their frequencies and linewidths.

A precise measurement of the magnetic field in the corona of the black hole binary V404 Cygni
<p>Observations of binary stars containing an accreting black hole or neutron star often show x-ray emission extending to high energies (>10 kilo­–electron volts), which is ascribed to an accretion disk corona of energetic particles akin to those seen in the solar corona. Despite their ubiquity, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al conditions in accretion disk coronae remain poorly constrained. Using simultaneous infrared, optical, x-ray, and radio observations of the Galactic black hole system V404 Cygni, showing a rapid synchrotron cooling event in its 2015 outburst, we present a precise 461 ± 12 gauss magnetic field measurement in the corona. This measurement is substantially lower than previous estimates for such systems, providing constraints on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al models of accretion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s in black hole and neutron star binary systems.</p>

Cognition-mediated evolution of low-quality floral nectars
<p>Plants pollinated by hummingbirds or bats produce dilute nectars even though these animals prefer more concentrated sugar solutions. This mismatch is an unsolved evolutionary paradox. Here we show that lower quality, or more dilute, nectars evolve when the strength of preferring larger quantities or higher qualities of nectar diminishes as magnitudes of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al stimuli increase. In a virtual evolution experiment conducted in the tropical rainforest, bats visited computer-automated flowers with simulated genomes that evolved relatively dilute nectars. Simulations replicated this evolution only when value functions, which relate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al stimuli to subjective sensations, were nonlinear. Selection also depended on the supply/demand ratio; bats selected for more dilute nectar when competition for food was higher. We predict such a pattern to generally occur when decision-makers consider multiple value dimensions simultaneously, and increases of psychological value are not fully proportional to increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al magnitude.</p>

Physical Activity and Heart Rate Variability in Older Adults

Key-and-lock commodity self-healing copolymers
<p>Self-healing materials are notable for their ability to recover from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al or chemical damage. We report that commodity copolymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate)/n-butyl acrylate [p(MMA/nBA)] and their derivatives, can self-heal upon mechanical damage. This behavior occurs in a narrow compositional range for copolymer topologies that are preferentially alternating with a random component (alternating/random) and is attributed to favorable interchain van der Waals forces forming key-and-lock interchain junctions. The use of van der Waals forces instead of supramolecular or covalent rebonding or encapsulated reactants eliminates chemical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al alterations and enables multiple recovery upon mechanical damage without external intervention. Unlike other self-healing approaches, perturbation of ubiquitous van der Waals forces upon mechanical damage is energetically unfavorable for interdigitated alternating/random copolymer motifs that facilitate self-healing under ambient conditions.</p>

A skyrmion is a type of topological defect that has shown promise for applications in the fields of magnetic storage and spintronics. We show that optical skyrmion lattices can be generated using evanescent electromagnetic fields and demonstrate this using surface plasmon polaritons, imaged by phase-resolved near-field optical microscopy. We show how the optical skyrmion lattice exhibits robustness to imperfections while the topological domain walls in the lattice can be continuously tuned, changing the spatial structure of the skyrmions from bubble type to Néel type. Extending the generation of skyrmions to photonic systems provides various possibilities for applications in optical information processing, transfer, and storage.</p>

In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to denote the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al manifestation of a memory in the brain (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb posited a physiological correlate for learning and recollection: The process of learning strengthens the connections, or synapses, between neurons, which leads to the development of brain-wide cell assemblies that undergo changes in their structural and functional connectivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these assemblies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during learning (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable neuronal correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent memories are formed, the dynamics of these assemblies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the brain processes the variety of memories an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the brain and modulate them in a synapse-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate memories to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

German law allows use of DNA to predict suspects' looks
<p>Police in the German state of Bavaria now have the authority to analyze forensic DNA samples to predict the geographical ancestry and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al characteristics—hair color, eye color, skin color, and age—of an unknown suspect who poses an imminent danger. The controversial law, which passed the Landtag, the state parliament in Munich, on 15 May, is the first in Germany to allow what has been dubbed DNA phenotyping, and it has sparked renewed debate here and in other countries about the advantages—and risks—of the technology. German federal authorities, and police in the country's 15 other states, are only allowed to perform DNA fingerprinting, in which they look for an exact match between crime scene DNA and samples in a database of known criminals or from a suspect. DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction, however, have been used in the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and several U.S. states. Some critics caution that although the underlying science connecting genetic markers to certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al features is solid, DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction still come with significant uncertainties that can be easily misunderstood by police and the public.</p>

Magnetic seismology of interstellar gas clouds: Unveiling a hidden dimension
<p>Stars and planets are formed inside dense interstellar molecular clouds by processes imprinted on the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the clouds. Determining the 3D structure of interstellar clouds remains challenging because of projection effects and difficulties measuring the extent of the clouds along the line of sight. We report the detection of normal vibrational modes in the isolated interstellar cloud Musca, allowing determination of the 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al dimensions of the cloud. We found that Musca is vibrating globally, with the characteristic modes of a sheet viewed edge on, not the characteristics of a filament as previously supposed. We reconstructed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al properties of Musca through 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, reproducing the observed normal modes and confirming a sheetlike morphology.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Experiments
<p>Physical systems exhibiting topological invariants are naturally endowed with robustness against perturbations, as manifested in topological insulators—materials exhibiting robust electron transport, immune from scattering by defects and disorder. Recent years have witnessed intense efforts toward exploiting these phenomena in photonics. Here we demonstrate a nonmagnetic topological insulator laser system exhibiting topologically protected transport in the cavity. Its topological properties give rise to single-mode lasing, robustness against defects, and considerably higher slope efficiencies compared to the topologically trivial counterparts. We further exploit the properties of active topological platforms by assembling the system from <i>S</i>-chiral microresonators, enforcing predetermined unidirectional lasing without magnetic fields. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> paves the way toward active topological devices with exciting properties and functionalities.</p>

‘CAMERA’ records cell action with new CRISPR tricks
<p>Biologists long have devised ways to track the inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing of cells, tagging genes with fluorescent proteins and the like to better understand diseases, embryology, and environmental impacts. With the advent of CRISPR, best known as a genome editing tool, many groups have tried to fashion novel recording devices. In a proof-of-concept study published in this week's issue of <i>Science</i>, Harvard University's David Liu and Weixin Tang exploit the components of CRISPR to create two new recording systems that they call a CRISPR-mediated analog multievent recording apparatus, or CAMERA for short. One CAMERA system records with the help of plasmids, circular pieces of DNA that float around bacterial cell cytoplasms. In this scheme, CRISPR kicks into action in response to a stimulus like light, an antibiotic, or a virus, directing the destruction of one of two nearly identical "recorder" plasmids. A tilt in the ratio of recorder one to recorder two captures the exposure to the stimulus, even offering details about the duration and intensity of the exposure. The second CAMERA, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>s in mammalian cells as well, uses a CRISPR variant called a base editor to alter the DNA in a "safe harbor" gene that can change its sequence without harming the cell. They show how the changes in the safe harbor gene's sequence can record signals from the cellular processes that a stimulus triggers, such as turning on a cancer-causing biochemical pathway.</p>

High-temperature pairing in a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas
<p>The nature of the normal phase of strongly correlated fermionic systems is an outstanding question in quantum many-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s. We used spatially resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure pairing energy of fermions across a wide range of temperatures and interaction strengths in a two-dimensional gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We observed many-body pairing at temperatures far above the critical temperature for superfluidity. In the strongly interacting regime, the pairing energy in the normal phase considerably exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing in this regime is driven by many-body correlations, rather than two-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s. Our findings show that pairing correlations in strongly interacting two-dimensional fermionic systems are remarkably robust against thermal fluctuations.</p>

Ten-month-old infants infer the value of goals from the costs of actions
<p>Infants understand that people pursue goals, but how do they learn which goals people prefer? We tested whether infants solve this problem by inverting a mental model of action planning, trading off the costs of acting against the rewards actions bring. After seeing an agent attain two goals equally often at varying costs, infants expected the agent to prefer the goal it attained through costlier actions. These expectations held across three experiments that conveyed cost through different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al path features (height, width, and incline angle), suggesting that an abstract variable—such as “force,” “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>,” or “effort”—supported infants’ inferences. We modeled infants’ expectations as Bayesian inferences over utility-theoretic calculations, providing a bridge to recent quantitative accounts of action understanding in older children and adults.</p>

Why is the flu vaccine so mediocre?
<p>With flu season around the corner in the United States and Europe, the push has begun once again to encourage people to receive their annual shots. But over the past few years, it's become increasingly clear that the level of protection offered by the vaccine varies widely each flu season, from 10% to 60%. And new research has revealed surprising reasons for its lackluster performance. For decades, it appeared that the vaccine had an efficacy of 70% to 90%, but scientists now know that's because they were using a misleading test—replaced in the 1990s—to assess whether it protected people. The traditional explanation for failure also has been revamped. The flu strains selected for the vaccine change each year based on what's in circulation, and scientists long blamed failure on mutations that occur in the circulating viruses in the 6–8 months that pass between the vaccine being manufactured and used. But these "mismatches" sometimes occur in years when there's solid protection, and some years with lots of failure have good matches. It turns out that other forces at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> include mutations in the strain selected for the vaccine during the manufacturing process, which grows the virus in eggs. People's prior exposure to influenza also can bias their immune system toward a response that undermines that vaccine-triggered immunity. And the vaccine strain selection process itself relies heavily on the ferret animal model, which can mislead, too. There's an increasing call now to improve the vaccine and organize the research community to more collaboratively try to develop a "universal" flu shot that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>s against many strains and lasts for many years, if not a lifetime. </p>

Preventing mussel adhesion using lubricant-infused materials
<p>Mussels are opportunistic macrofouling organisms that can attach to most immersed solid surfaces, leading to serious economic and ecological consequences for the maritime and aquaculture industries. We demonstrate that lubricant-infused coatings exhibit very low preferential mussel attachment and ultralow adhesive strengths under both controlled laboratory conditions and in marine field studies. Detailed investigations across multiple length scales—from the molecular-scale characterization of deposited adhesive proteins to nanoscale contact mechanics to macroscale live observations—suggest that lubricant infusion considerably reduces fouling by deceiving the mechanosensing ability of mussels, deterring secretion of adhesive threads, and decreasing the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> of adhesion. Our study demonstrates that lubricant infusion represents an effective strategy to mitigate marine biofouling and provides insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al mechanisms underlying adhesion prevention.</p>

Atomic-layered Au clusters on α-MoC as catalysts for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction

This equilibrium-limited reaction is favored at a low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing temperature. Potential application in fuel cells also requires a WGS catalyst to be highly active, stable, and energy-efficient and to match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing temperature of on-site hydrogen generation and consumption units. We synthesized layered gold (Au) clusters on a molybdenum carbide (α-MoC) substrate to create an interfacial catalyst system for the ultralow-temperature WGS reaction. Water was activated over α-MoC at 303 kelvin, whereas carbon monoxide adsorbed on adjacent Au sites was apt to react with surface hydroxyl groups formed from water splitting, leading to a high WGS activity at low temperatures.</p>

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices
<p>Cyclotron motion of charge carriers in metals and semiconductors leads to Landau quantization and magneto-oscillatory behavior in their properties. Cryogenic temperatures are usually required to observe these oscillations. We show that graphene superlattices support a different type of quantum oscillation that does not rely on Landau quantization. The oscillations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that charge carriers experience effectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> hints at unexplored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s in Hofstadter butterfly systems at high temperatures.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

The AAA-ATPase MIDASIN 1 Functions in Ribosome Biogenesis and Is Essential for Embryo and Root Development
<p>Ribosome biogenesis is an orchestrated process that relies on many assembly factors. The AAA-ATPase Midasin 1 (Mdn1) functions as a ribosome assembly factor in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>), but the roles of MDN1 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we showed that the Arabidopsis null mutant of <i>MDN1</i> is embryo-lethal. Using the weak mutant <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i>, which maintains viability, we found that MDN1 is critical for the regular pattern of auxin maxima in the globular embryo and functions in root meristem maintenance. By detecting the subcellular distribution of ribosome proteins, we noted that <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> impairs nuclear export of the pre-60S ribosomal particle. The processing of ribosomal precusor RNAs, including 35S, 27SB, and 20S, is also affected in this mutant. MDN1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>ally interacts with PESCADILLO2 (PES2), an essential assembly factor of the 60S ribosome, and the observed mislocalization of PES2 in <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> further implied that MDN1 plays an indispensable role in 60S ribosome biogenesis. Therefore, the observed hypersensitivity of <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> to a eukaryotic translation inhibitor and high-sugar conditions might be associated with the defect in ribosome biogenesis. Overall, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> establishes a role of Arabidopsis MDN1 in ribosome biogenesis, which agrees with its roles in embryogenesis and root development.</p>

Leaf and Plant Age Affects Photosynthetic Performance and Photoprotective Capacity
<p>In this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>, we studied the changes in high-light tolerance and photosynthetic activity in leaves of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette throughout the vegetative stage of growth. We implemented an image-analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> flow to analyze the capacity of both the whole plant and individual leaves to cope with excess excitation energy by following the changes in absorbed light energy partitioning. The data show that leaf and plant age are both important factors influencing the fate of excitation energy. During the dark-to-light transition, the age of the plant affects mostly steady-state levels of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching, leading to an increased photosynthetic performance of its leaves. The age of the leaf affects the induction kinetics of nonphotochemical quenching. These observations were confirmed using model selection procedures. We further investigated how different leaves on a rosette acclimate to high light and show that younger leaves are less prone to photoinhibition than older leaves. Our results stress that both plant and leaf age should be taken into consideration during the quantification of photosynthetic and photoprotective traits to produce repeatable and reliable results.</p>

A PIF1/PIF3-HY5-BBX23 Transcription Factor Cascade Affects Photomorphogenesis
<p>Light signaling plays an essential role in controlling higher plants’ early developmental process termed as photomorphogenesis. Transcriptional regulation is a vital mechanism that is orchestrated by transcription factors and other regulatory proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing in concert to finely tune gene expression. Although many transcription factors/regulators have been characterized in the light-signaling pathway, their interregulation remains largely unknown. Here, we show that PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3) and PIF1 transcription factors directly bind to the regulatory regions of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and a B-box gene BBX23 and activate their expression in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that BBX23 and its close homolog gene BBX22 play a redundant role in regulating hypocotyl growth, and that plants overexpressing BBX23 display reduced hypocotyl elongation under red, far-red, and blue light conditions. Intriguingly, BBX23 transcription is inhibited by light, whereas its protein is degraded in darkness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HY5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>ally interacts with BBX23, and these two proteins coordinately regulate the expression of both light-induced and light-repressed genes. BBX23 is also recruited to the promoter sequences of the light-responsive genes in a partial HY5-dependent manner. Taken together, our study reveals that the transcriptional cascade consisting of PIF1/PIF3, HY5, and BBX23 controls photomorphogenesis, providing a transcriptional regulatory layer by which plants fine-tune their growth in response to changing light environment.</p>

Defining the Diverse Cell Populations Contributing to Lignification in Arabidopsis Stems<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many land plants evolved tall and sturdy growth habits due to specialized cells with thick lignified cell walls: tracheary elements that function in water transport and fibers that function in structural support. The objective of this study was to define how and when diverse cell populations contribute lignin precursors, monolignols, to secondary cell walls during lignification of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inflorescence stem. Previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> demonstrated that, when lignin biosynthesis is suppressed in fiber and tracheary element cells with thickened walls, fibers become lignin-depleted while vascular bundles still lignify, suggesting that nonlignifying neighboring xylem cells are contributing to lignification.

Analysis of either reductions in lignin in knockdown lines, or the addition of novel monolignol conjugates, directly identifies the xylary parenchyma and fiber cell populations that contribute to the stem lignification and the developmental timing at which each contribution is most important.</p>

<p>The cell-to-cell transport of signaling molecules is essential for multicellular organisms to coordinate the action of their cells. Recent studies identified DWARF14 (D14) as a receptor of strigolactones (SLs), molecules that act as plant hormones and inhibit shoot branching.

Comparative Genomics of the Pine Pathogens and Beetle Symbionts in the Genus <i>Grosmannia</i>
<p>Studies on beetle/tree fungal symbionts typically characterize the ecological and geographic distributions of the fungal populations. There is limited understanding of the genome-wide evolutionary processes that act within and between species as such fungi adapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess genomic evidence for such evolutionary processes by extending our recent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> on <i>Grosmannia clavigera</i>, which is vectored by the mountain pine beetle and jeffrey pine beetle. We report the genome sequences of an additional 11 <i>G. clavigera</i> (Gc) sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species, <i>Grosmannia</i> sp. (Gs) and Gc. The 12 fungal genomes are structurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between species. We identified 103,430 single-nucleotide variations that separated the <i>Grosmannia</i> strains into divergent Gs and Gc clades, and further divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which may represent an additional species. Comparing variable genes between these lineages, we identified truncated genes and potential pseudogenes, as well as seven genes that show evidence of positive selection. As these variable genes are involved in secondary metabolism and in detoxifying or utilizing host-tree defense chemicals (e.g., polyketide synthases, oxidoreductases, and mono-oxygenases), their variants may reflect adaptation to the specific chemistries of the host trees <i>Pinus contorta</i>, <i>P. ponderosa</i>, and <i>P. jeffreyi</i>. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> provides a comprehensive resource for developing informative markers for landscape population genomics of these ecologically and economically important fungi, and an approach that could be extended to other beetle–tree-associated fungi.</p>

Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies
<p>Life experiences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether differences in experience could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking males that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social experience and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al environment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> males are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local environment. Although dominant males are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression based on experience. We hypothesized that as males mature they might hone their fighting tactics based on observation of other males fighting. We compared males of different ages and sizes in distinctly different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al environments and subsequently tested their fighting skills. We found that a size difference previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing environmental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that males only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that experience is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant experience than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al complexity of the territory.</p>

Arthroscopic decompression not recommended in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Rotator cuff tendinopathy has a multifactorial origin. Rejecting   the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning operative treatment   at initial presentation in the first line. Physiotherapy exercise   programmes are the accepted first line treatment. The aim of this   study was to assess the long-term additional benefits of subacromial decompression   in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This randomised controlled trial of 140 patients (52 men, 88   women, mean age 47.1 years; 18 to 60) with rotator cuff tendinopathy   extended previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong> up to a maximum of 13 years. The patients   were randomised into two treatment groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty   and a supervised exercise treatment and a similar supervised exercise   treatment alone. Self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS)   was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures were disability,   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">work</span></strong>ing ability, pain at night, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire   score and the number of painful days during the three months preceding   the final assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 90 patients (64%) returned questionnaires at a mean   12 years after randomisation. On an intention-to-treat basis, both   treatment groups reached statistically significant improvement compared   with the initial VAS for pain, but there was no significant difference   between groups. The same was true in the secondary outcome measures.   Due to group changes, the results were also analysed per protocol:   operated or not. No significant differences between the groups were   found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The natural history of rotator cuff tendinopathy probably plays   a significant role in the results in the long-term. Even though   the patients who underwent operative treatment had a stronger belief   in recovery, which is likely to be surgical and the effect of placebo,   the exercise group obtained similar results. In the future, an optimum   exercise regime should be searched for, as the most clinically and   cost-effective conservative treatment for rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:799–805.</p></sec>

Do radiological and functional outcomes correlate for fractures of the distal radius?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We conducted a study to determine whether radiological parameters   correlate with patient reported functional outcome, health-related   quality of life and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al measures of function in patients with   a fracture of the distal radius.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The post-operative palmar tilt and ulnar variance at six weeks   and 12 months were correlated with the Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation,   Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand, and EuroQol scores,   grip strength, pinch strength and range of movement at three, six   and 12 months for 50 patients (mean age 57 years; 26 to 85) having surgical   fixation, with either percutaneous pinning or reconstruction with   a volar plate, for a fracture of the distal radius.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Radiological parameters were found to correlate poorly with the   patient reported outcomes (r = 0.00 to 0.47) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al measures   of function (r = 0.01 to 0.51) at all intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study raises concerns about the use of radiological parameters   to determine management, and to act as a surrogates for successful   treatment, in patients with a fracture of the distal radius.

Physical Activity and Prognosis in the TOPCAT Trial (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al activity (PA) is inversely associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in healthy populations, but the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al activity in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction is less well characterized.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The baseline self-reported PA of 1751 subjects enrolled in the Americas region of the TOPCAT trial (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist) was categorized as poor, intermediate, or ideal PA with American Heart Association criteria. PA was related to the primary composite outcome (HF hospitalization, cardiovascular mortality, or aborted cardiac arrest), its components, and all-cause mortality with the use of multivariable Cox models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age at enrollment was 68.6±9.6 years. Few patients met American Heart Association criteria for ideal activity (11% ideal, 14% intermediate, 75% poor). Over a median follow-up of 2.4 years, the primary composite outcome occurred in 519 patients (397 HF hospitalizations, 222 cardiovascular deaths, and 6 aborted cardiac arrests). Compared with those with ideal baseline PA, poor and intermediate baseline PA was associated with a greater risk of the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28–3.28; HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.15–3.33, respectively), HF hospitalization (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.16–3.22; HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.02–3.31), cardiovascular mortality (HR, 4.36; 95% CI, 1.37–13.83; HR, 4.05; 95% CI, 1.17–14.04), and all-cause mortality (HR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.44–6.02; HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 0.90–4.67) after multivariable adjustment for potential confounders.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction, both poor and intermediate self-reported PA were associated with higher risk of HF hospitalization and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Fire Simulation and Cardiovascular Health in Firefighters
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Rates of myocardial infarction in firefighters are increased during fire suppression duties, and are likely to reflect a combination of factors including extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al exertion and heat exposure. We assessed the effects of simulated fire suppression on measures of cardiovascular health in healthy firefighters.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In an open-label randomized crossover study, 19 healthy firefighters (age, 41±7 years; 16 males) performed a standardized training exercise in a fire simulation facility or light duties for 20 minutes. After each exposure, ex vivo thrombus formation, fibrinolysis, platelet activation, and forearm blood flow in response to intra-arterial infusions of endothelial-dependent and -independent vasodilators were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After fire simulation training, core temperature increased (1.0±0.1°C) and weight reduced (0.46±0.14 kg, <i>P</i><0.001 for both). In comparison with control, exposure to fire simulation increased thrombus formation under low-shear (73±14%) and high-shear (66±14%) conditions (<i>P</i><0.001 for both) and increased platelet-monocyte binding (7±10%, <i>P</i>=0.03). There was a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow with all vasodilators (<i>P</i><0.001), which was attenuated by fire simulation in response to acetylcholine (<i>P</i>=0.01) and sodium nitroprusside (<i>P</i>=0.004). This was associated with a rise in fibrinolytic capacity, asymptomatic myocardial ischemia, and an increase in plasma cardiac troponin I concentrations (1.4 [0.8–2.5] versus 3.0 [1.7–6.4] ng/L, <i>P</i>=0.010).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Exposure to extreme heat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al exertion during fire suppression activates platelets, increases thrombus formation, impairs vascular function, and promotes myocardial ischemia and injury in healthy firefighters. Our findings provide pathogenic mechanisms to explain the association between fire suppression activity and acute myocardial infarction in firefighters.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

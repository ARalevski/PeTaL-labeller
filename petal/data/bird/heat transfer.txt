Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and water use efficiencies. To improve water use efficiency, mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance, water use efficiency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance and water use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing water use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance.</p>

Plastid Translation Elongation Factor Tu Is Prone to Heat-Induced Aggregation Despite Its Critical Role in Plant Heat Tolerance
<p>Translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is a conserved GTP-binding protein essential for protein translation in prokaryotes and in eukaryotic mitochondria and plastids. EF-Tu also has a GTP/GDP-independent chaperone activity that may function in acclimation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plastid EF-Tu, Rabe1b, rapidly becomes insoluble at temperatures as low as 35°C in vitro and 41°C in vivo, with more than 90% aggregation after 9 h at 45°C in vivo. Based on its established function in protein translation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced aggregation likely inactivates Rabe1b. To determine the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced aggregation, we isolated an Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> knockdown mutant and discovered it to be highly compromised in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. Overexpression of constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant forms of Rabe1b in Arabidopsis and virus-induced silencing of <i>Rabe1b</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) also reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. Compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance in the Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant and in the lines overexpressing constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant Rabe1b proteins was associated with reduced plastid translation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. The Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant also showed compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced expression of <i>HsfA2</i> and its target genes. Constitutive overexpression of HsfA2 activated its target genes but only partially restored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance of the <i>rabe1b</i> mutant. These results strongly suggest that the plastid protein EF-Tu is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> sensitive and acts as a critical limiting factor in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress responses, primarily functioning in plastid protein translation but also in protein folding and retrograde signaling of nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-responsive gene expression.</p>

Highly efficient electrocaloric cooling with electrostatic actuation
<p>Solid-state refrigeration offers potential advantages over traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing systems, but few devices offer high specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing power with a high coefficient of performance (COP) and the ability to be applied directly to surfaces.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
STABILIZED1 Modulates Pre-mRNA Splicing for Thermotolerance
<p>High-temperature stress often leads to differential RNA splicing, thus accumulating different types and/or amounts of mature mRNAs in eukaryotic cells. However, regulatory mechanisms underlying plant precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing in the environmental stress conditions remain elusive. Herein, we describe that a U5-snRNP-interacting protein homolog STABILIZED1 (STA1) has pre-mRNA splicing activity for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-inducible transcripts including <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</i>s and various <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> SHOCK PROTEIN</i>s for the establishment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our cell-based splicing reporter assay demonstrated STA1 acts on pre-mRNA splicing for specific subsets of stress-related genes. Cellular reconstitution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-inducible transcription cascades supported the view that STA1-dependent pre-mRNA splicing plays a role in DREB2A-dependent <i>HSFA3</i> expression for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-responsive gene expression. Further genetic analysis with a loss-of-function mutant <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in Col background, and <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background verified that STA1 is essential in expression of necessary genes including <i>HSFA3</i> for two-step <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress tolerance in plants. However, constitutive overexpression of the cDNA version of <i>HSFA3</i> in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background is unable to execute plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress tolerance in <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>. Consistently our global target analysis of STA1 showed that its splicing activity modulates a rather broad range of gene expression in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> treatment. The findings of this study reveal that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-inducible STA1 activity for pre-mRNA splicing serves as a molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the plant stress tolerance to high-temperature stress.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In addition, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In addition, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG accumulation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in addition to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

Interhospital Transfer Before Thrombectomy Is Associated With Delayed Treatment and Worse Outcome in the STRATIS Registry (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Endovascular treatment with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is beneficial for patients with acute stroke suffering a large-vessel occlusion, although treatment efficacy is highly time-dependent. We hypothesized that interhospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> to endovascular-capable centers would result in treatment delays and worse clinical outcomes compared with direct presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>STRATIS (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke) was a prospective, multicenter, observational, single-arm study of real-world MT for acute stroke because of anterior-circulation large-vessel occlusion performed at 55 sites over 2 years, including 1000 patients with severe stroke and treated within 8 hours. Patients underwent MT with or without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and were admitted to endovascular-capable centers via either interhospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> or direct presentation. The primary clinical outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Score 0–2) at 90 days. We assessed (1) real-world time metrics of stroke care delivery, (2) outcome differences between direct and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> patients undergoing MT, and (3) the potential impact of local hospital bypass.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 984 patients were analyzed. Median onset-to-revascularization time was 202.0 minutes for direct versus 311.5 minutes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> patients (<i>P</i><0.001). Clinical outcomes were better in the direct group, with 60.0% (299/498) achieving functional independence compared with 52.2% (213/408) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> group (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.79; <i>P</i>=0.02).

Mortality did not differ between the 2 groups (15.1% for direct, 13.7% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>; <i>P</i>=0.55). Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator did not impact outcomes. Hypothetical bypass modeling for all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red patients suggested that intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 12 minutes, but MT would be performed 91 minutes sooner if patients were routed directly to endovascular-capable centers. If bypass is limited to a 20-mile radius from onset, then intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 7 minutes and MT performed 94 minutes earlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this large, real-world study, interhospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> was associated with significant treatment delays and lower chance of good outcome.

Systematic Biology
Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead
<p>In phylogenetic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a gene was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>s involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the evolution of genes along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near-universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> events (28%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>s trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

High thermal conductivity in cubic boron arsenide crystals

The thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity of BAs, 1000 ± 90 watts per meter per kelvin meter-kelvin, is higher than that of silicon carbide by a factor of 3 and is surpassed only by diamond and the basal-plane value of graphite.

Inflammation boosts bacteriophage transfer between <i>Salmonella</i> spp.
<p>Bacteriophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> (lysogenic conversion) promotes bacterial virulence evolution. There is limited understanding of the factors that determine lysogenic conversion dynamics within infected hosts. A murine <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm) diarrhea model was used to study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of SopEΦ, a prophage from <i>S</i>.Tm SL1344, to <i>S</i>.Tm ATCC14028S. Gut inflammation and enteric disease triggered >55% lysogenic conversion of ATCC14028S within 3 days. Without inflammation, SopEΦ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> was reduced by up to 10<sup>5</sup>-fold. This was because inflammation (e.g., reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, hypochlorite) triggers the bacterial SOS response, boosts expression of the phage antirepressor Tum, and thereby promotes free phage production and subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>. Mucosal vaccination prevented a dense intestinal <i>S</i>.Tm population from inducing inflammation and consequently abolished SopEΦ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>.

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% loss of stem hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% loss of hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (change in percentage loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its hydraulic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Unusual high thermal conductivity in boron arsenide bulk crystals
<p>Conventional theory predicts that ultrahigh lattice thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity can only occur in crystals composed of strongly bonded light elements, and that it is limited by anharmonic three-phonon processes. We report experimental evidence that departs from these long-held criteria. We measured a local room-temperature thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity exceeding 1000 watts per meter-kelvin and an average bulk value reaching 900 watts per meter-kelvin in bulk boron arsenide (BAs) crystals, where boron and arsenic are light and heavy elements, respectively. The high values are consistent with a proposal for phonon-band engineering and can only be explained by higher-order phonon processes. These findings yield insight into the physics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ion in solids and show BAs to be the only known semi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>or with ultrahigh thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity.</p>

A nonconjugated radical polymer glass with high electrical conductivity

Anomalously low electronic thermal conductivity in metallic vanadium dioxide

Different from previously established mechanisms, the unusually low electronic thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity is a signature of the absence of quasiparticles in a strongly correlated electron fluid where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> and charge diffuse independently.</p>

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>

Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during dehydration; (2) its basis in the hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem pathways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its dynamics on irradiance; (4) its impact on diurnal patterns of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas exchange and survival under simulated drought regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong vulnerability to dehydration diurnally in both gas exchange and hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced sensitivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to dehydration. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher irradiance in well-hydrated leaves across the full range of water potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> vulnerability was observed. Modeling indicated that responses to dehydration and irradiance are likely attributable to changes in membrane permeability and that a dynamic <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> would contribute strongly to stomatal closure, improving performance, survival, and efficient water use during drought. These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in hydraulic traits and their influence on gas exchange during dehydration.</p>

Bioorthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) Enables Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein Synthesis in Native Plant Tissue
<p>Proteomic plasticity undergirds stress responses in plants, and understanding such responses requires accurate measurement of the extent to which proteins levels are adjusted to counter external stimuli. Here, we adapt bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to interrogate protein synthesis in vegetative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. BONCAT relies on the translational incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid probe into cellular proteins. In this study, the probe is the Met surrogate azidohomoalanine (Aha), which carries a reactive azide moiety in its amino acid side chain. The azide handle in Aha can be selectively conjugated to dyes and functionalized beads to enable visualization and enrichment of newly synthesized proteins. We show that BONCAT is sensitive enough to detect Arabidopsis proteins synthesized within a 30-min interval defined by an Aha pulse and that the method can be used to detect proteins made under conditions of light stress, osmotic shock, salt stress, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, and recovery from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. We further establish that BONCAT can be coupled to tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins synthesized during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress and recovery from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Our results are consistent with a model in which, upon the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, translation is rapidly reprogrammed to enhance the synthesis of stress mitigators and is again altered during recovery. All experiments were carried out with commercially available reagents, highlighting the accessibility of the BONCAT method to researchers interested in stress responses as well as translational and posttranslational regulation in plants.</p>

Integrating Omics and Alternative Splicing Reveals Insights into Grape Response to High Temperature
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress is one of the primary abiotic stresses that limit crop production. Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a cultivated fruit with high economic value throughout the world, with its growth and development often influenced by high temperature. Alternative splicing (AS) is a widespread phenomenon increasing transcriptome and proteome diversity. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ed high-temperature treatments (35°C, 40°C, and 45°C) on grapevines and assessed transcriptomic (especially AS) and proteomic changes in leaves. We found that nearly 70% of the genes were alternatively spliced under high temperature. Intron retention (IR), exon skipping, and alternative donor/acceptor sites were markedly induced under different high temperatures. Among all differential AS events, IR was the most abundant up- and down-regulated event. Moreover, the occurrence frequency of IR events at 40°C and 45°C was far higher than at 35°C. These results indicated that AS, especially IR, is an important posttranscriptional regulatory event during grape leaf responses to high temperature. Proteomic analysis showed that protein levels of the RNA-binding proteins SR45, SR30, and SR34 and the nuclear ribonucleic protein U1A gradually rose as ambient temperature increased, which revealed a reason why AS events occurred more frequently under high temperature. After integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> shock proteins and some important transcription factors such as MULTIPROTEIN BRIDGING FACTOR1c and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A2 were involved mainly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance in grape through up-regulating transcriptional (especially modulated by AS) and translational levels. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for grape leaf responses to high temperature at simultaneous transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels.</p>

Evolutionary capacity of upper thermal limits: beyond single trait assessments
<p>Thermal tolerance is an important factor influencing the distribution of ectotherms, but we still have limited understanding of the ability of species to evolve different thermal limits. Recent studies suggest that species may have limited capacity to evolve higher thermal limits in response to slower, more ecologically relevant rates of warming. However, these conclusions are based on univariate estimates of adaptive capacity. To test these findings within an explicitly multivariate context, we used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to estimate the multivariate evolutionary potential for upper thermal limits in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We assessed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance using static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero only for the static measures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. Our <bold>G</bold> matrix analysis revealed that any response to selection for increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance will largely be driven by static basal and hardened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance, with minimal contribution from ramping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. These results suggest that the capacity to evolve upper thermal limits in nature may depend on the type of thermal stress experienced.</p>

Structural basis of cooling agent and lipid sensing by the cold-activated TRPM8 channel
<p>Transient receptor potential melastatin member 8 (TRPM8) is a calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)–permeable cation channel that serves as the primary cold and menthol sensor in humans. Activation of TRPM8 by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing compounds relies on allosteric actions of agonist and membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), but lack of structural information has thus far precluded a mechanistic understanding of ligand and lipid sensing by TRPM8. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structures of TRPM8 in complex with the synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing compound icilin, PIP<sub>2</sub>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as well as in complex with the menthol analog WS-12 and PIP<sub>2</sub>. Our structures reveal the binding sites for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing agonists and PIP<sub>2</sub> in TRPM8. Notably, PIP<sub>2</sub> binds to TRPM8 in two different modes, which illustrate the mechanism of allosteric coupling between PIP<sub>2</sub> and agonists. This study provides a platform for understanding the molecular mechanism of TRPM8 activation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing agents.</p>

The Little Ice Age and 20th-century deep Pacific cooling
<p>Proxy records show that before the onset of modern anthropogenic warming, globally coherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing occurred from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. The long memory of the ocean suggests that these historical surface anomalies are associated with ongoing deep-ocean temperature adjustments. Combining an ocean model with modern and paleoceanographic data leads to a prediction that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing going into the Little Ice Age, whereas temperature trends in the surface ocean and deep Atlantic reflect modern warming. This prediction is corroborated by temperature changes identified between the HMS Challenger expedition of the 1870s and modern hydrography.

Experimental observation of high thermal conductivity in boron arsenide
<p>Improving the thermal management of small-scale devices requires developing materials with high thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivities. The semi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>or boron arsenide (BAs) is an attractive target because of ab initio calculation indicating that single crystals have an ultrahigh thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity. We synthesized BAs single crystals without detectable defects and measured a room-temperature thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity of 1300 watts per meter-kelvin. Our spectroscopy study, in conjunction with atomistic theory, reveals that the distinctive band structure of BAs allows for very long phonon mean free paths and strong high-order anharmonicity through the four-phonon process. The single-crystal BAs has better thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity than other metals and semi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ors.

Two-channel model for ultralow thermal conductivity of crystalline Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>
<p>Solids with ultralow thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity are of great interest as thermal barrier coatings for insulation or thermoelectrics for energy conversion. However, the theoretical limits of lattice thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity (κ) are unclear. In typical crystals a phonon picture is valid, whereas lowest κ values occur in highly disordered materials where this picture fails and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> is supposedly carried by random walk among uncorrelated oscillators. Here we identify a simple crystal, Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>, with a calculated phonon κ [0.16 Watts per meter-Kelvin (W/m-K)] one-half that of our measured κ (0.30 W/m-K) at 300 K, approaching disorder κ values, although Raman spectra, specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>, and temperature dependence of κ reveal typical phonon characteristics. Adding a transport component based on uncorrelated oscillators explains the measured κ and suggests that a two-channel model is necessary for crystals with ultralow κ.</p>

From a starting number of 2000 atoms, 1400 atoms reach quantum degeneracy in 300 milliseconds, as confirmed by a bimodal velocity distribution.

Learning-enhanced coupling between ripple oscillations in association cortices and hippocampus

Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling

We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime radiative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine.

Melting of Iron at Earth’s Inner Core Boundary Based on Fast X-ray Diffraction

Alternative Oxidase Capacity of Mitochondria in Microsporophylls May Function in Cycad Thermogenesis
<p>Cone thermogenesis is a widespread phenomenon in cycads and may function to promote volatile emissions that affect pollinator behavior. Given their large population size and intense and durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-producing effects, cycads are important organisms for comprehensive studies of plant thermogenesis. However, knowledge of mitochondrial morphology and function in cone thermogenesis is limited. Therefore, we investigated these mitochondrial properties in the thermogenic cycad species <i>Cycas revoluta</i>. Male cones generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> even in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong> weather conditions. Female cones produced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>, but to a lesser extent than male cones. Ultrastructural analyses of the two major tissues of male cones, microsporophylls and microsporangia, revealed the existence of a population of mitochondria with a distinct morphology in the microsporophylls. In these cells, we observed large mitochondria (cross-sectional area of 2 μm<sup>2</sup> or more) with a uniform matrix density that occupied >10% of the total mitochondrial volume. Despite the size difference, many nonlarge mitochondria (cross-sectional area <2 μm<sup>2</sup>) also exhibited a shape and a matrix density similar to those of large mitochondria. Alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and expression levels in microsporophylls were much higher than those in microsporangia. The <i>AOX</i> genes expressed in male cones revealed two different <i>AOX</i> complementary DNA sequences: <i>CrAOX1</i> and <i>CrAOX2</i>. The expression level of <i>CrAOX1</i> mRNA in the microsporophylls was 100 times greater than that of <i>CrAOX2</i> mRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that distinctive mitochondrial morphology and CrAOX1-mediated respiration in microsporophylls might play a role in cycad cone thermogenesis.</p>

Glucose-Regulated <i>HLP1</i> Acts as a Key Molecule in Governing Thermomemory
<p>Induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> shock proteins (HSPs) in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress (HS) is indispensable for conferring thermotolerance. Glc, a fundamental signaling and metabolic molecule, provides energy to stressed seedlings to combat stress. The recovery of stressed plants from detrimental HS in response to Glc is largely mediated by HSPs, but the mechanistic basis of this thermotolerance is not well defined. In this study, we show that Glc has a prominent role in providing thermotolerance. Glc-mediated thermotolerance involves HSP induction via the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR)-E2Fa signaling module. Apart from HSPs, TOR-E2Fa also regulates the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ortholog of human <i>Hikeshi</i>, named <i>HIKESHI</i>-<i>LIKE PROTEIN1</i> (<i>HLP1</i>). Expression of <i>proHLP1</i>::<i>GUS</i> in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) after HS coincides with TOR-E2Fa expression, substantiating a role for TOR-E2Fa-HLP1 in providing thermotolerance. We also demonstrate that Glc along with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> could induce proliferation activity in the SAM after HS recovery, which was arrested by the TOR inhibitor AZD-8055. Molecular and physiological studies suggest that HS-activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress transcription factor A1s also positively regulate <i>HLP1</i> transcription, suggesting convergence of the Glc and HS signaling pathways. Loss of functional HLP1 causes HS hypersensitivity, whereas HLP1 overexpressors display increased thermotolerance. HLP1 binds to the promoters of Glc-regulated HS-responsive genes and promotes chromatin acetylation. In addition, Glc modifies the chromatin landscape at thermomemory-related loci by promoting H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Glc-primed accumulation of H3K4me3 at thermomemory-associated loci is mediated through HLP1. These findings reveal the novel function of Glc-regulated <i>HLP1</i> in mediating thermotolerance/thermomemory response.</p>

The Pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 Sustains Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis as a Function of Heat Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants sense temperature changes and respond by altering growth and metabolic activity to acclimate to the altered environmental conditions. The B vitamins give rise to vital coenzymes that are indispensable for growth and development but their inherent reactive nature renders them prone to destruction especially under stress conditions. Therefore, plant survival strategies would be expected to include mechanisms to sustain B vitamin supply under demanding circumstances. Here, using the example of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, we investigate the regulation of biosynthesis across eudicot and monocot species under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Most eudicots carry a pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 that is a noncatalytic homolog of the PDX1 subunit of the vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis protein machinery, PYRIDOXINE BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN1. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) as models, we show that <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> is transcriptionally regulated by the HSFA1 transcription factor family. Monocots only carry catalytic <i>PDX1</i> homologs that do not respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress as demonstrated for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis across the two lineages. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> transcription reveals two alternative transcriptional start sites, one of which is exclusive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Further data suggest that PDX1.2 leads to stabilization of the catalytic PDX1s under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress conditions, which would serve to maintain vitamin B<sub>6</sub> homeostasis in times of need in eudicots that carry this gene. Our analyses indicate an important abiotic stress tolerance strategy in several eudicots, which has not been evolutionarily adapted (or is not required) by monocots such as grasses.</p>

The Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein AtLtpI-4 Is Involved in Suberin Formation of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Crown Galls
<p>Nonspecific lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> proteins reversibly bind different types of lipid molecules in a hydrophobic cavity. They facilitate phospholipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> between membranes in vitro, play a role in cuticle and possibly in suberin formation, and might be involved in plant pathogen defense signaling. This study focuses on the role of the lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> protein <i>AtLTPI-4</i> in crown gall development. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) crown gall tumors, which develop upon infection with the virulent <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> strain C58, highly expressed <i>AtLTPI-4</i>. Crown galls of the <i>atltpI-4</i> loss-of-function mutant were much smaller compared with those of wild-type plants. The gene expression pattern and localization of the protein to the plasma membrane pointed to a function of AtLTPI-4 in cell wall suberization. Since Arabidopsis crown galls are covered by a suberin-containing periderm instead of a cuticle, we analyzed the suberin composition of crown galls and found a reduction in the amounts of long-chain fatty acids (C<sub>18:0</sub>) in the <i>atltpI-4</i> mutant. To demonstrate the impact of AtLtpI-4 on extracellular lipid composition, we expressed the protein in Arabidopsis epidermis cells. This led to a significant increase in the very-long-chain fatty acids C<sub>24</sub> and C<sub>26</sub> in the cuticular wax fraction. Homology modeling and lipid-protein-overlay assays showed that AtLtpI-4 protein can bind these very-long-chain fatty acids. Thus, AtLtpI-4 protein may facilitate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of long-chain as well as very-long-chain fatty acids into the apoplast, depending on the cell type in which it is expressed. In crown galls, which endogenously express AtLtpI-4, it is involved in suberin formation.</p>

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ed to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energy transf</span></strong>er.</p>

3D charge and 2D phonon transports leading to high out-of-plane <i>ZT</i> in n-type SnSe crystals
<p>Thermoelectric technology enables the harvest of waste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> and its direct conversion into electricity. The conversion efficiency is determined by the materials figure of merit <i>ZT</i>. Here we show a maximum <i>ZT</i> of ~2.8 ± 0.5 at 773 kelvin in n-type tin selenide (SnSe) crystals out of plane. The thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity in layered SnSe crystals is the lowest in the out-of-plane direction [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport]. We doped SnSe with bromine to make n-type SnSe crystals with the overlapping interlayer charge density (3D charge transport). A continuous phase transition increases the symmetry and diverges two converged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ion bands. These two factors improve carrier mobility, while preserving a large Seebeck coefficient. Our findings can be applied in 2D layered materials and provide a new strategy to enhance out-of-plane electrical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport properti</span></strong>es without degrading thermal properties.</p>

Maxima in the thermodynamic response and correlation functions of deeply supercooled water
<p>Femtosecond x-ray laser pulses were used to probe micrometer-sized water droplets that were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ed down to 227 kelvin in vacuum. Isothermal compressibility and correlation length were extracted from x-ray scattering at the low–momentum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> region. The temperature dependence of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic response and correlation functions shows maxima at 229 kelvin for water and 233 kelvin for heavy water. In addition, we observed that the liquids undergo the fastest growth of tetrahedral structures at similar temperatures. These observations point to the existence of a Widom line, defined as the locus of maximum correlation length emanating from a critical point at positive pressures in the deeply super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ed regime. The difference in the maximum value of the isothermal compressibility between the two isotopes shows the importance of nuclear quantum effects.</p>

Femtosecond laser reshaping yields gold nanorods with ultranarrow surface plasmon resonances
<p>The irradiation of gold nanorod colloids with a femtosecond laser can be tuned to induce controlled nanorod reshaping, yielding colloids with exceptionally narrow localized surface plasmon resonance bands. The process relies on a regime characterized by a gentle multishot reduction of the aspect ratio, whereas the rod shape and volume are barely affected. Successful reshaping can only occur within a narrow window of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> dissipation rate: Low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing rates lead to drastic morphological changes, and fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing has nearly no effect. Hence, a delicate balance must be achieved between irradiation fluence and surface density of the surfactant on the nanorods. This perfection process is appealing because it provides a simple, fast, reproducible, and scalable route toward gold nanorods with an optical response of exceptional quality, near the theoretical limit.</p>

Mediating ER-mitochondrial cross-talk
<p>Cellular function and survival require the highly ordered subcellular localization of organelles. In particular, there is considerable interest in understanding the interconnectedness of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. The direct interaction of ER and mitochondrial membranes is referred to as tethering, typically defined as an interorganelle distance of less than 30 nm. Tethering has been implicated in numerous physiological processes, including lipid synthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>, coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>, autophagosome formation, inflammatory signaling, mitochondrial morphology, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) synthesis and distribution (<i>1</i>–<i>5</i>). Although the functional relevance of ER-mitochondrial tethering is widely accepted, identification of the proteins that constitute these interconnected structures has remained elusive. On page 623 of this issue, Hirabayashi <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) show that PDZ domain containing protein 8 (PDZD8) is required for the tethering of ER and mitochondrial membranes and is critical for Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> from ER to mitochondria.</p>

Plants transfer lipids to sustain colonization by mutualistic mycorrhizal and parasitic fungi
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi facilitate plant uptake of mineral nutrients and draw organic nutrients from the plant. Organic nutrients are thought to be supplied primarily in the form of sugars. Here we show that the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> is a fatty acid auxotroph and that fatty acids synthesized in the host plants are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red to the fungus to sustain mycorrhizal colonization. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> is dependent on RAM2 (REQUIRED FOR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZATION 2) and the ATP binding cassette transporter–mediated plant lipid export pathway. We further show that plant fatty acids can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red to the pathogenic fungus <i>Golovinomyces cichoracerum</i> and are required for colonization by pathogens. We suggest that the mutualistic mycorrhizal and pathogenic fungi similarly recruit the fatty acid biosynthesis program to facilitate host invasion.</p>

Rapid cooling and cold storage in a silicic magma reservoir recorded in individual crystals
<p>Silicic volcanic eruptions pose considerable hazards, yet the processes leading to these eruptions remain poorly known. A missing link is knowledge of the thermal history of magma feeding such eruptions, which largely controls crystallinity and therefore eruptability. We have determined the thermal history of individual zircon crystals from an eruption of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. Results show that although zircons resided in the magmatic system for 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> years, they experienced temperatures >650° to 750°C for only years to centuries. This implies near-solidus long-term crystal storage, punctuated by rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>ing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing. Reconciling these data with existing models of magma storage requires considering multiple small intrusions and multiple spatial scales, and our approach can help to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> input to and output from magma reservoirs.</p>

Quantized thermal transport in single-atom junctions
<p>Thermal transport in individual atomic junctions and chains is of great fundamental interest because of the distinctive quantum effects expected to arise in them. By using novel, custom-fabricated, picowatt-resolution calorimetric scanning probes, we measured the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance of gold and platinum metallic wires down to single-atom junctions. Our work reveals that the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance of gold single-atom junctions is quantized at room temperature and shows that the Wiedemann-Franz law relating thermal and electrical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance is satisfied even in single-atom contacts. Furthermore, we quantitatively explain our experimental results within the Landauer framework for quantum thermal transport. The experimental techniques reported here will enable thermal transport studies in atomic and molecular chains, which will be key to investigating numerous fundamental issues that thus far have remained experimentally inaccessible.</p>

Photosensitized, energy transfer-mediated organometallic catalysis through electronically excited nickel(II)
<p>Transition metal catalysis has traditionally relied on organometallic complexes that can cycle through a series of ground-state oxidation levels to achieve a series of discrete yet fundamental fragment-coupling steps. The viability of excited-state organometallic catalysis via direct photoexcitation has been demonstrated. Although the utility of triplet sensitization by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energy transf</span></strong>er has long been known as a powerful activation mode in organic photochemistry, it is surprising to recognize that photosensitization mechanisms to access excited-state organometallic catalysts have lagged far behind. Here, we demonstrate excited-state organometallic catalysis via such an activation pathway: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energy transf</span></strong>er from an iridium sensitizer produces an excited-state nickel complex that couples aryl halides with carboxylic acids. Detailed mechanistic studies confirm the role of photosensitization via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energy transf</span></strong>er.</p>

Spectroscopic snapshots of the proton-transfer mechanism in water
<p>The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high proton mobility in water as a sequence of proton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>s along a hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) network. However, the vibrational spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk water. Here we report how the much simpler vibrational spectra of cold, composition-selected heavy water clusters, D<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>, can be exploited to capture clear markers that encode the collective reaction coordinate along the proton-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> event. By complexing the solvated hydronium “Eigen” cluster [D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>] with increasingly strong H-bond acceptor molecules (D<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO, and D<sub>2</sub>O), we are able to track the frequency of every O-D stretch vibration in the complex as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ring hydron is incrementally pulled from the central hydronium to a neighboring water molecule.</p>

Mechanisms of reef coral resistance to future climate change
<p>Reef corals are highly sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>, yet populations resistant to climate change have recently been identified. To determine the mechanisms of temperature tolerance, we reciprocally transplanted corals between reef sites experiencing distinct temperature regimes and tested subsequent physiological and gene expression profiles. Local acclimatization and fixed effects, such as adaptation, contributed about equally to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance and are reflected in patterns of gene expression. In less than 2 years, acclimatization achieves the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance that we would expect from strong natural selection over many generations for these long-lived organisms. Our results show both short-term acclimatory and longer-term adaptive acquisition of climate resistance. Adding these adaptive abilities to ecosystem models is likely to slow predictions of demise for coral reef ecosystems.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As water often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant water capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of water across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root water transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of water pathways and root radial hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream hydraulic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of water-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of water flow across roots. The explicit root hydraulic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root water relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root hydraulics.</p>

Beyond Porosity: 3D Leaf Intercellular Airspace Traits That Impact Mesophyll Conductance
<p>The leaf intercellular airspace (IAS) is generally considered to have high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion relative to the liquid phase. While previous studies accounted for leaf-level variation in porosity and mesophyll thickness, they omitted 3D IAS traits that potentially influence IAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (g<sub>IAS</sub>). Here, we reevaluated the standard equation for g<sub>IAS</sub> by incorporating tortuosity, lateral path lengthening, and IAS connectivity. We measured and spatially mapped these geometric IAS traits for 19 Bromeliaceae species with Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) or C3 photosynthetic pathways using x-ray microcomputed tomography imaging and a novel computational approach. We found substantial variation in porosity (0.04–0.73 m<sup>3</sup> m<sup>−3</sup>), tortuosity (1.09–3.33 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>), lateral path lengthening (1.12–3.19 m m<sup>−1</sup>), and IAS connectivity (0.81–0.97 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>) across all bromeliad leaves. The revised g<sub>IAS</sub> model predicted significantly lower g<sub>IAS</sub> in CAM (0.01–0.19 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) than in C3 (0.41–2.38 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) plants due to a coordinated decline in these IAS traits. Our reevaluated equation also generally predicted lower g<sub>IAS</sub> values than the former one. Moreover, we observed high spatial heterogeneity in these IAS geometric traits throughout the mesophyll, especially within CAM leaves. Our data show that IAS traits that better capture the 3D complexity of leaves strongly influence g<sub>IAS</sub> and that the impact of the IAS on mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance should be carefully considered with respect to leaf anatomy. We provide a simple function to estimate tortuosity and lateral path lengthening in the absence of access to imaging tools such as x-ray microcomputed tomography or other novel 3D image-processing techniques.</p>

Carbonic Anhydrase Mutants in <i>Zea mays</i> Have Altered Stomatal Responses to Environmental Signals
<p>Stomata regulate transpirational water loss and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis in response to changing environmental conditions. Research investigating stomatal movement has mostly been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ed in C<sub>3</sub> eudicot species, which have very different CO<sub>2</sub> requirements for photosynthesis relative to C<sub>4</sub> grasses. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub>, and its activity has been linked to stomatal aperture regulation in eudicots. The number of <i>Ca</i> genes and their evolutionary history differ between monocots and dicots, and many questions remain unanswered about potential neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization of grass <i>Ca</i> paralogs and their roles in photosynthesis and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance. To investigate the roles of different <i>Ca</i> genes in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we examined stomatal responses in <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants as well as a <i>ca1ca2</i> double mutant. The <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants had 10% and 87% of the CA activity exhibited by the wild type, respectively, while <i>ca1ca2</i> had less than 5% of wild-type CA activity. The <i>ca</i> mutants had higher stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance than the wild type and slower stomatal closure in response to increases in CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure. Contrary to previous reports in eudicots, <i>ca</i> mutants showed slowed stomatal closure in response to the light-dark transition and did not show differences in stomatal density compared with the wild type. These results implicate CA-mediated signaling in the control of stomatal movement but not stomatal development. Drought experiments with <i>ca1ca2</i> mutant plants suggest a role for CA in water-use efficiency and reveal that <i>Z. mays</i> is not optimized for water-use efficiency under well-watered conditions.</p>

Stomatal VPD Response: There Is More to the Story Than ABA
<p>Guard cells shrink and close stomatal pores when air humidity decreases (i.e. when the difference between the vapor pressures of leaf and atmosphere [VPD] increases). The role of abscisic acid (ABA) in VPD-induced stomatal closure has been studied using ABA-related mutants that respond to VPD in some studies and not in others. The importance of ABA biosynthesis in guard cells versus vasculature for whole-plant stomatal regulation is unclear as well. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines carrying mutations in different steps of ABA biosynthesis as well as pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <i>wilty</i> and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>flacca</i> ABA-deficient mutants had higher stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance compared with wild-type plants. To characterize the role of ABA production in different cells, we generated transgenic plants where ABA biosynthesis was rescued in guard cells or phloem companion cells of an ABA-deficient mutant. In both cases, the whole-plant stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance, stunted growth phenotype, and leaf ABA level were restored to wild-type values, pointing to the redundancy of ABA sources and to the effectiveness of leaf ABA transport. All ABA-deficient lines closed their stomata rapidly and extensively in response to high VPD, whereas plants with mutated protein kinase OST1 showed stunted VPD-induced responses. Another strongly ABA-insensitive mutant, defective in the six ABA PYR/RCAR receptors, responded to changes in VPD in both directions strongly and symmetrically, indicating that its VPD-induced closure could be passive hydraulic. We discuss that both the VPD-induced passive hydraulic stomatal closure and the stomatal VPD regulation of ABA-deficient mutants may be conditional on the initial pretreatment stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing carotenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>. This suggests that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

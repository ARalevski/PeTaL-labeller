Generation of specific inhibitors of SUMO-1– and SUMO-2/3–mediated protein-protein interactions using Affimer (Adhiron) technology
<p>Because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions underpin most biological processes, developing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the development of therapeutics is an important task. SUMOylation is the posttranslational covalent attachment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the SUMO family (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3), and it regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are recognized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) that facilitate noncovalent interactions with SUMO. We describe the use of the Affimer system of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e display for the rapid isolation of synthetic binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that inhibit SUMO-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions mediated by SIMs both in vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s did not prevent SUMO conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific analysis of SUMO-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions. Furthermore, through structural analysis and molecular modeling, we explored the molecular mechanisms that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO-1–mediated interactions or interactions mediated by either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Not only will these reagents enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, but the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s could also be exploited to design or validate reagents or therapeutics that target other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s irreversibly. Here, we ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>ed two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>o acids or by interaction with reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>es arising from cell membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and 131 to bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were identified in vivo, including three key nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s: sucrose synthase, glut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and 18 bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

Genomics and evolution of protein phosphatases
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases are the essential opposite to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases; tog<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong>, these enzymes regulate all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation and most cellular processes. To better understand the global roles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation, we cataloged the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatome, composed of 189 known and predicted human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase genes. We also identified 79 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase pseudogenes or retrogenes, some of which may have residual function. We traced the origin and diversity of phosphatases by building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatomes for eight other eukaryotes, from the protist <i>Dictyostelium</i> to the sea urchin. We classified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases from all nine species into a hierarchy of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> folds, 21 families, and 178 subfamilies. We found that >80% of the 101 human subfamilies were conserved across the animal kingdom, but show substantial differences in evolution, including losses and expansions of individual subfamilies and changes in accessory domains. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases show similar evolutionary dynamics to those of kinases, with substantial losses in major model organisms. Sequence analysis predicts that 26 human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase domains are catalytically disabled and that this disability is mostly conserved across orthologs. This genomic and evolutionary perspective on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases provides a framework for global analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation throughout the animal kingdom.</p>

The G Protein <i>β</i>-Subunit, AGB1, Interacts with FERONIA in RALF1-Regulated Stomatal Movement
<p>Heterotrimeric guanine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotid</span></strong>e-binding (G) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are composed of Gα, G<i>β</i>, and Gγ subunits and function as molecular switches in signal transduction. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are one canonical Gα (GPA1), three extra-large Gα (XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3), one G<i>β</i> (AGB1), and three Gγ (AGG1, AGG2, and AGG3) subunits. To elucidate AGB1 molecular signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation using plasma membrane-enriched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s followed by mass spectrometry to identify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactors of AGB1. After eliminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s present in the control immunoprecipitation, commonly identified cont<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>ants, and organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, a total of 103 candidate AGB1-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were confidently identified. We identified all of the G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> subunits except XLG1, receptor-like kinases, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, and 14-3-3-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, all of which may couple with or modulate G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling. We confirmed physical interaction between AGB1 and the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) family of poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es have been shown to be ligands of FER. In this study, we demonstrate that RALF1 regulates stomatal apertures and does so in a G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-dependent manner, inhibiting stomatal opening and promoting stomatal closure in Columbia but not in <i>agb1</i> mutants. We further show that AGGs and XLGs, but not GPA1, participate in RALF1-mediated stomatal signaling. Our results suggest that FER acts as a G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-coupled receptor for plant heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed coat mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> profiles except for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s include a family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed coats, and their expression requires seed coat differentiation regulators. TBA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s to the seed coat epidermis. Altog<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong>, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Aldehyde Oxidase 4 Plays a Critical Role in Delaying Silique Senescence by Catalyzing Aldehyde Detoxification
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>e oxidases are a multigene family of four oxidases (AAO1–AAO4) that oxidize a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>es, among them abscisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>e, which is oxidized to the phytohormone abscisic acid. Toxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>es are generated in plants both under normal conditions and in response to stress. The detoxification of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>es by oxidation is attributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>e dehydrogenases but never to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>e oxidases. The feasibility of the detoxification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>es in siliques via oxidation by AAO4 was demonstrated, first, by its ability to efficiently oxidize an array of aromatic and aliphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>es, including the reactive carbonyl species (RCS) acrolein, hydroxyl-2-nonenal, and malondi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>e. Next, exogenous application of several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>es to siliques in AAO4 knockout (KO) Arabidopsis plants induced severe tissue damage and enhanced malondi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>e levels and senescence symptoms, but not in wild-type siliques. Furthermore, abiotic stresses such as dark and ultraviolet C irradiation caused an increase in endogenous RCS and higher expression levels of senescence marker genes, leading to premature senescence of KO siliques, whereas RCS and senescence marker levels in wild-type siliques were hardly affected. Finally, in naturally senesced KO siliques, higher endogenous RCS levels were associated with enhanced senescence molecular markers, chlorophyll degradation, and earlier seed shattering compared with the wild type. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>e-dependent differential generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by AAO4 and the induction of AAO4 expression by hydrogen peroxide shown here suggest a self-amplification mechanism for detoxifying additional reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>es produced during stress. Taken tog<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong>, our results indicate that AAO4 plays a critical role in delaying senescence in siliques by catalyzing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>e detoxification.</p>

Bioenergetics through thick and thin

In recent years, and with the advent of advanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>omics techniques, we have learned that “a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>” is simply not true, and that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition of membranes can have profound effects on the behavior and activity of its resident macromolecules. For example, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, such as members of the phosphatidylinositol family, are important signaling molecules. However, what is less appreciated is that the physical composition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> membranes can have profound effects on cellular behavior as well. On page 1186 of this issue, Budin <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) use the Gram-negative bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> and the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as model systems to show that the fluidity of a membrane, as determined by its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, can have huge effects on the efficiency of aerobic energy production (respiration) by the highly hydrophobic, membrane-embedded, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system.</p>

Tandem Fluorescent Protein Timers for Noninvasive Relative Protein Lifetime Measurement in Plants
<p>Targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation is an important and pervasive regulatory mechanism in plants, required for perception and response to the environment as well as developmental signaling. Despite the significance of this process, relatively few studies have assessed plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in a quantitative fashion. Tandem fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> timers (tFTs) offer a powerful approach for the assessment of in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in distinct subcellular compartments of single or multiple cells. A tFT is a fusion of two different fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with distinct fluorophore maturation kinetics, which enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> age to be estimated from the ratio of fluorescence intensities of the two fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Here, we used short-lived auxin signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and model N-end rule (N-recognin) pathway reporters to demonstrate the utility of tFTs for studying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in living plant cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We present transient expression of tFTs as an efficient screen for relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> lifetime, useful for testing the effects of mutations and different genetic backgrounds on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> stability. This work demonstrates the potential for using stably expressed tFTs to study native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> dynamics with high temporal resolution in response to exogenous or endogenous stimuli.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>

Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction, and integration of interacting partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrocarbon</span></strong> chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken tog<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong>, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabolit</span></strong>es, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

The Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein AtLtpI-4 Is Involved in Suberin Formation of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Crown Galls
<p>Nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s reversibly bind different types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> molecules in a hydrophobic cavity. They facilitate phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer between membranes in vitro, play a role in cuticle and possibly in suberin formation, and might be involved in plant pathogen defense signaling. This study focuses on the role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> <i>AtLTPI-4</i> in crown gall development. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) crown gall tumors, which develop upon infection with the virulent <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> strain C58, highly expressed <i>AtLTPI-4</i>. Crown galls of the <i>atltpI-4</i> loss-of-function mutant were much smaller compared with those of wild-type plants. The gene expression pattern and localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> to the plasma membrane pointed to a function of AtLTPI-4 in cell wall suberization. Since Arabidopsis crown galls are covered by a suberin-containing periderm instead of a cuticle, we analyzed the suberin composition of crown galls and found a reduction in the amounts of long-chain fatty acids (C<sub>18:0</sub>) in the <i>atltpI-4</i> mutant. To demonstrate the impact of AtLtpI-4 on extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, we expressed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> in Arabidopsis epidermis cells. This led to a significant increase in the very-long-chain fatty acids C<sub>24</sub> and C<sub>26</sub> in the cuticular wax fraction. Homology modeling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-overlay assays showed that AtLtpI-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> can bind these very-long-chain fatty acids. Thus, AtLtpI-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> may facilitate the transfer of long-chain as well as very-long-chain fatty acids into the apoplast, depending on the cell type in which it is expressed. In crown galls, which endogenously express AtLtpI-4, it is involved in suberin formation.</p>

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the phosphates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with 4-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>o-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>oarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional phosphate group to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A negative charge. Our findings demonstrate how bacteria tailor their cell surface to different stresses, such as those faced inside phagocytes.</p>

Linking Duplication of a Calcium Sensor to Salt Tolerance in <i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-OVERLY-SENSITIVE (SOS) pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) functions to prevent the toxic accumulation of sodium in the cytosol when plants are grown in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-affected soils. In this pathway, the CALCINEURIN B-LIKE10 (AtCBL10) calcium sensor interacts with the AtSOS2 kinase to activate the AtSOS1 plasma membrane sodium/proton exchanger. <i>CBL10</i> has been duplicated in Eutrema (<i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>), a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-tolerant relative of Arabidopsis. Because Eutrema maintains growth in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-affected soils that kill most crop plants, the duplication of <i>CBL10</i> provides a unique opportunity to functionally test the outcome of gene duplication and its link to plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance. In Eutrema, individual down-regulation of the duplicated <i>CBL10</i> genes (<i>EsCBL10a</i> and <i>EsCBL10b</i>) decreased growth in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> and, in combination, led to an even greater decrease, suggesting that both genes function in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> and have distinct functions. Cross-species complementation assays demonstrated that <i>EsCBL10b</i> has an enhanced ability to activate the SOS pathway while <i>EsCBL10a</i> has a function not performed by <i>AtCBL10</i> or <i>EsCBL10b</i>. Chimeric EsCBL10a/EsCBL10b <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s revealed that the specific functions of the EsCBL10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s resulted from changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>o terminus. The duplication of <i>CBL10</i> increased calcium-mediated signaling capacity in Eutrema and conferred increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-sensitive Arabidopsis.</p>

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts
<p>Chloroplasts import many pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that can be classified based on their physicochemical properties. The cleavable N-terminal transit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e (TP) of chloroplast pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s contains all the information required for import into chloroplasts through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of wh<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong> and how the physicochemical properties of pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s affect TP-mediated import into chloroplasts has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient translocation through the chloroplast envelope membranes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s containing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s prone to aggregation. By contrast, the translocation of soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s through the chloroplast envelope membranes is less dependent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation into chloroplasts; instead, these mutant TPs led to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> mistargeting to the chloroplast envelope membranes or nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> aggregation during import into chloroplasts. The mistargeting of TMD-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation is compromised. We propose that the physicochemical properties of chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation through the chloroplast envelope, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient translocation of TMD-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s (glycerides, fatty acids, phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, lysophospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, and galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s into the fragmentation of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Lipidomics Profiling and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in the Prospective Population-Based Bruneck Study
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The bulk of cardiovascular disease risk is not explained by traditional risk factors.

Saltational evolution of the heterotrimeric G protein signaling mechanisms in the plant kingdom
<p>Signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s evolved diverse interactions to provide specificity for distinct stimuli. Signaling complexity in the G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> (heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate–binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>) network was achieved in animals through subunit duplication and incremental evolution. By combining comprehensive and quantitative phenotypic profiles of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> evolution informatics, we found that plant heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> machinery evolved by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>ational (jumping) process. Sequence similarity scores mapped onto tertiary structures, and biochemical validation showed that the extra-large Gα (XLG) subunit evolved extensively in the charophycean algae (an aquatic green plant) by gene duplication and gene fusion. In terrestrial plants, further evolution uncoupled XLG from its negative regulator, regulator of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling, but preserved an α-helix region that enables interaction with its partner Gβγ. The ancestral gene evolved slowly due to the molecular constraints imposed by the need for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> to maintain interactions with various partners, whereas the genes encoding XLG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s evolved rapidly to produce three highly divergent members. Analysis of <i>A. thaliana</i> mutants indicated that these Gα and XLG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s all function with Gβγ and evolved to operate both independently and cooperatively. The XLG-Gβγ machinery specialized in environmental stress responses, whereas the canonical Gα-Gβγ retained developmental roles. Some developmental processes, such as shoot development, involve both Gα and XLG acting cooperatively or antagonistically. These extensive and rapid evolutionary changes in XLG structure compared to those of the canonical Gα subunit contrast with the accepted notion of how pathway diversification occurs through gene duplication with subsequent incremental coevolution of residues among interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Aberrant choice behavior in alcoholism
<p>More than 2 billion people worldwide regularly drink <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> is a component cause of more than 200 diseases and causes ∼3.3 million deaths per year globally (<i>1</i>). The major disease burden comes from harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> consumption and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> dependence. Not everyone who regularly consumes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> becomes dependent: ∼15% become engaged in harmful and compulsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> drinking (<i>2</i>). Patients suffering from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> dependence no longer have the freedom to choose between alternative rewards because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> drinking dictates what should be done next, namely, shaping activities for the next drink. On page 1321 of this issue, Augier <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that aberrant choice behavior—that is, choosing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> over an alternative reward—is a key driver for the transition from controlled to compulsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> use. They also provide a mechanistic understanding of this aberrant choice behavior that could lead to new treatment opportunities.</p>

Crystal structure of a TAPBPR–MHC I complex reveals the mechanism of peptide editing in antigen presentation

Chaperone-mediated loading of high-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es onto MHC I is a key step in the MHC I antigen presentation pathway. However, the structure of MHC I with a chaperone that facilitates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e loading has not been determined. We report the crystal structure of MHC I in complex with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e editor TAPBPR (TAP-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>–related), a tapasin homolog. TAPBPR remodels the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e-binding groove of MHC I, resulting in the release of low-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e. Changes include groove relaxation, modifications of key binding pockets, and domain adjustments. This structure captures a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e-receptive state of MHC I and provides insights into the mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e editing by TAPBPR and, by analogy, tapasin.</p>

Multisite phosphorylation by MAPK
<p>Reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in signal transduction networks. Phosphorylation alters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function by regulating enzymatic activity, stability, cellular localization, or binding partners. Over three-quarters of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s may be phosphorylated, with many targeted at multiple sites. Such multisite phosphorylation substantially increases the scope for modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function—a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> with <i>n</i> phosphorylation sites has the potential to exist in 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> distinct phosphorylation states, each of which could, in theory, display modified functionality. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s can be substrates for several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases, thereby integrating distinct signals to provide a coherent biological response. However, they can also be phosphorylated at multiple sites by a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase to promote a specific functional output that can be reversed by dephosphorylation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases. On page 233 of this issue, Mylona <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal an unexpected role for multisite phosphorylation, whereby a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase progressively phosphorylates sites on a transcription factor to promote and then subsequently limit its activity independently of dephosphorylation.</p>

The <i>MicroRNA390</i>/<i>TRANS-ACTING SHORT INTERFERING RNA3</i> Module Mediates Lateral Root Growth under Salt Stress via the Auxin Pathway
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-induced developmental plasticity in a plant root system strongly depends on auxin signaling. However, the molecular events underlying this process are poorly understood. <i>MicroRNA390</i> (<i>miR390</i>), <i>trans-actin small interfering RNA</i>s (<i>tasiRNA</i>s), and <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs</i> (<i>ARFs</i>) form a regulatory module involved in controlling lateral root (LR) growth. Here, we found that <i>miR390</i> expression was strongly induced by exposure to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> during LR formation in poplar (<i>Populus</i> spp.) plants. <i>miR390</i> overexpression stimulated LR development and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance, whereas <i>miR390</i> knockdown caused by a short tandem target mimic repressed LR growth and compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> resistance. <i>ARF3.1</i>, <i>ARF3.2</i>, and <i>ARF4</i> expression was inhibited significantly by the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>, and transcript abundance was decreased dramatically in the <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing line but increased in the <i>miR390</i>-knockdown line. Constitutive expression of <i>ARF4m</i> harboring mutated <i>trans-acting small interfering ARF</i>-binding sites removed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> resistance of the <i>miR390</i> overexpressors. <i>miR390</i> positively regulated auxin signaling in LRs subjected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>, but <i>ARF4</i> inhibited auxin signaling. Salinity stabilized the poplar Aux/IAA repressor INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID17.1, and overexpression of an auxin/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-resistant form of this repressor suppressed LR growth in <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing and <i>ARF4</i>-RNA interfering lines in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>. Thus, the <i>miR390/TAS3/ARFs</i> module is a key regulator, via modulating the auxin pathway, of LR growth in poplar subjected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress.</p>

Tagged null mutants of <i>OHP1</i> and <i>OHP2</i> (<i>ohp1</i> and <i>ohp2</i>) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s revealed that <i>ohp1</i> deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic <i>ohp1</i> plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s developed a normal phenotype.

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis in oil seeds is still not fully understood. Oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabolit</span></strong>es directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cholin</span></strong>es. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cholin</span></strong>e molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> distribution profiles observed imply differential regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oilseed rape productivity and quality.</p>

Glycerolipid Characterization and Nutrient Deprivation-Associated Changes in the Green Picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i>
<p>The picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i> is a minimal photosynthetic eukaryote that has been used as a model system. <i>O. tauri</i> is known to efficiently produce docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We provide a comprehensive study of the glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>ome of <i>O. tauri</i> and validate this species as model for related picoeukaryotes. <i>O. tauri</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s displayed unique features that combined traits from the green and the chromalveolate lineages. The betaine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> diacylglyceryl-hydroxymethyl-trimethyl-β-alanine and phosphatidyldimethylpropanethiol, both hallmarks of chromalveolates, were identified as presumed extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. DHA was confined to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, while plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s of prokaryotic type were characterized by the overwhelming presence of ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs), 18:5 being restricted to galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. C16:4, an FA typical of green microalgae galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, also was a major component of <i>O. tauri</i> extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, while the 16:4-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coenzym</span></strong>e A (CoA) species was not detected. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) displayed the complete panel of FAs, and many species exhibited combinations of FAs diagnostic for plastidial and extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Importantly, under nutrient deprivation, 16:4 and ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated FAs accumulated into de novo synthesized TAGs while DHA-TAG species remained rather stable, indicating an increased contribution of FAs of plastidial origin to TAG synthesis. Nutrient deprivation further severely down-regulated the conversion of 18:3 to 18:4, resulting in obvious inversion of the 18:3/18:4 ratio in plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, TAGs, as well as acyl-CoAs. The fine-tuned and dynamic regulation of the 18:3/18:4 ratio suggested an important physiological role of these FAs in photosynthetic membranes. Acyl position in structural and storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s tog<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong> with acyl-CoA analysis further help to determine mechanisms possibly involved in glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are much larger than the bacterial BcsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, prompting the suggestion that these plant-specific regions are important for interactions between CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and for conferring CESA class specificity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and hence what determines the specificity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class specificity extends throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site specificity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

Proximity biotinylation identifies a set of conformation-specific interactions between Merlin and cell junction proteins
<p>Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited, neoplastic disease associated with schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas and that is caused by inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene <i>NF2</i>. The <i>NF2</i> gene product, Merlin, has no intrinsic catalytic activity; its tumor suppressor function is mediated through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with which it interacts. We used proximity biotinylation followed by mass spectrometry and direct binding assays to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that associated with wild-type and various mutant forms of Merlin in immortalized Schwann cells. We defined a set of 52 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in close proximity to wild-type Merlin. Most of the Merlin-proximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were components of cell junctional signaling complexes, suggesting that additional potential interaction partners may exist in adherens junctions, tight junctions, and focal adhesions. With mutant forms of Merlin that cannot bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) or that constitutively adopt a closed conformation, we confirmed a critical role for PIP<sub>2</sub> binding in Merlin function and identified a large cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that specifically interacted with Merlin in the closed conformation. Among these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, we identified a previously unreported Merlin-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, apoptosis-stimulated p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 2 (ASPP2, also called Tp53bp2), that bound to closed-conformation Merlin predominately through the FERM domain. Our results demonstrate that Merlin is a component of cell junctional mechanosensing complexes and defines a specific set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s through which it acts.</p>

“Disruptor” residues in the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) R12 subfamily attenuate the inactivation of Gα subunits
<p>Understanding the molecular basis of interaction specificity between RGS (regulator of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and heterotrimeric (αβγ) G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s would enable the manipulation of RGS-G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions, explore their functions, and effectively target them therapeutically. RGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are classified into four subfamilies (R4, R7, RZ, and R12) and function as negative regulators of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling by inactivating Gα subunits. We found that the R12 subfamily members RGS10 and RGS14 had lower activity than most R4 subfamily members toward the G<sub>i</sub> subfamily member Gα<sub>o</sub>. Using structure-based energy calculations with multiple Gα-RGS complexes, we identified R12-specific residues in positions that are predicted to determine the divergent activity of this subfamily. This analysis predicted that these residues, which we call “disruptor residues,” interact with the Gα helical domain. We engineered the R12 disruptor residues into the RGS domains of the high-activity R4 subfamily and found that these altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s exhibited reduced activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Reciprocally, replacing the putative disruptor residues in RGS18 (a member of the R4 subfamily that exhibited low activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>) with the corresponding residues from a high-activity R4 subfamily RGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> increased its activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Furthermore, the high activity of the R4 subfamily toward Gα<sub>o</sub> was independent of the residues in the homologous positions to the R12 subfamily and RGS18 disruptor residues. Thus, our results suggest that the identified RGS disruptor residues function as negative design elements that attenuate RGS activity for specific Gα <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Aurora B opposes PP1 function in mitosis by phosphorylating the conserved PP1-binding RVxF motif in PP1 regulatory proteins
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a highly conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase that performs most of the serine- and threonine-dephosphorylation reactions in eukaryotes and opposes the actions of a diverse set of serine and threonine (Ser-Thr) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases. PP1 gains substrate specificity through binding to a large number (>200) of regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that control PP1 localization, activity, and interactions with substrates. PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF binding motif that is present in many of these regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes. We showed that a subset of the RVxF binding motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>o acid (RV[S/T]F), was phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily governed by the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites maintained the phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis by disrupting the assembly of PP1 holoenzymes. We generated an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s (KNL1, CDCA2, and RIF1) and multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that could potentially act as PP1 binding partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1, and ELYS) governed by this mechanism. Tog<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong>, these data suggest a general regulatory mechanism by which the coordinated activities of Aurora B and PP1 control mitotic progression.</p>

Random heteropolymers preserve protein function in foreign environments
<p>The successful incorporation of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s into synthetic polymers could lead to a new class of materials with functions found only in living systems. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s rarely function under the conditions suitable for polymer processing. On the basis of an analysis of trends in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> sequences and characteristic chemical patterns on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> surfaces, we designed four-monomer random heteropolymers to mimic intrinsically disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> solubilization and stabilization in non-native environments. The heteropolymers, with optimized composition and statistical monomer distribution, enable cell-free synthesis of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with proper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> folding for transport and enzyme-containing plastics for toxin bioremediation. Controlling the statistical monomer distribution in a heteropolymer, rather than the specific monomer sequence, affords a new strategy to interface with biological systems for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-based biomaterials.</p>

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s fold into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo designed mini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, 1000 natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences.

HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation
<p>Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is coproduced with ethylene in plant cells and is primarily enzymatically detoxified by the mitochondrial β-CYANOALANINE SYNTHASE (CAS-C1). Permanent or transient depletion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alterations in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> content, identifying 451 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that are absent or less abundant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that are only present or more abundant in <i>cas-c1</i>. Gene ontology classification of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s identified proteomic changes that explain the root hairless phenotype and the altered immune response observed in the <i>cas-c1</i> mutant. The mechanism of action of cyanide as a signaling molecule was addressed using two proteomic approaches aimed at identifying the <i>S-</i>cyanylation of Cys as a posttranslational modification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Both the 2-imino-thiazolidine chemical method and the direct untargeted analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified a set of 163 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s susceptible to <i>S-</i>cyanylation that included SEDOHEPTULOSE 1,7-BISPHOSPHATASE (SBPase), the PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE 20-3 (CYP20-3), and ENOLASE2 (ENO2). In vitro analysis of these enzymes showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation of SBPase Cys<sup>74</sup>, CYP20-3 Cys<sup>259</sup>, and ENO2 Cys<sup>346</sup> residues affected their enzymatic activity. Gene Ontology classification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction cluster analysis showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation is involved in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, and the Calvin and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met cycles.</p>

SENSITIVE TO SALT1, An Endoplasmic Reticulum-Localized Chaperone, Positively Regulates Salt Resistance

Through genetic screening, we identified and characterized an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>1</i> (<i>ses1</i>) mutant. <i>SES1</i> was ubiquitously expressed and induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> treatment. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-sensitive phenotype of <i>ses1</i> was due neither to the overaccumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> nor to the suppression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance-associated genes. <i>SES1</i> encoded an uncharacterized endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>. Coinciding with its subcellular distribution, <i>ses1</i> exhibited overactivation of unfolded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> response genes and was largely influenced by severe ER stress. Biochemical evidence revealed that SES1 functions as an important molecular chaperone to alleviate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-induced ER stress. Furthermore, the ER stress sensor basic leucine zipper factor17 transactivated <i>SES1</i> by binding directly to its promoter region. These results provide insights into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress responses and ER homeostasis and shed light on the mechanism by which <i>SES1</i> modulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> resistance.</p>

Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles

GLVs play roles in direct plant defense at wound sites, indirect plant defense via the attraction of herbivore predators, and plant-plant communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for plants to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduction of C6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>es into C6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>es. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>e reduction remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnam<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>e and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAM<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aldehyd</span></strong>E AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant plants displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore infestation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested wild-type plants compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> plants, which corresponded with reduced C6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> plants were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered photosystem II activity. Our study shows that reductases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding toxicity from volatile carbonyls and in the attraction of herbivore predators.</p>

INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 Recruits Histone Deacetylase and a Transcriptional Repression Complex to Regulate Rice Salt Tolerance
<p>Perception and transduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress signals are critical for plant survival, growth, and propagation. Thus, identification of components of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress-signaling pathway is important for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) molecular breeding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress resistance. Here, we report the identification of an apetala2/ethylene response factor transcription factor INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 (IDS1) and its roles in the regulation of rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance. By genetic screening and phenotype analysis, we demonstrated that IDS1 conferred transcriptional repression activity and acted as a negative regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance in rice. To identify potential downstream target genes regulated by IDS1, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing and ChIP-quantitative PCR assays and found that IDS1 may directly associate with the GCC-box-containing motifs in the promoter regions of abiotic stress-responsive genes, including <i>LEA1</i> (<i>LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEIN1</i>) and <i>SOS1</i> (<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i>), which are key genes regulating rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance. IDS1 physically interacted with the transcriptional corepressor topless-related 1 and the histone deacetylase HDA1, contributing to the repression of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> expression. Analyses of histone H3 acetylation status and RNA polymerase II occupation on the promoters of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> further defined the molecular foundation of the transcriptional repression activity of IDS1. Our findings illustrate an epigenetic mechanism by which IDS1 modulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress signaling as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance in rice.</p>

Multi-Omics Driven Assembly and Annotation of the Sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) Genome
<p>Indian sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) is an important tropical evergreen tree known for its fragrant heartwood-derived essential oil and its valuable carving wood. Here, we applied an integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approach to assemble and annotate the Indian sandalwood genome. Our genome sequencing resulted in the establishment of a draft map of the smallest genome for any woody tree species to date (221 Mb). The genome annotation predicted 38,119 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-coding genes and 27.42% repetitive DNA elements. In-depth proteome analysis revealed the identities of 72,325 unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es, which confirmed 10,076 of the predicted genes. The addition of transcriptomic and proteogenomic approaches resulted in the identification of 53 novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and 34 gene-correction events that were missed by genomic approaches. Proteogenomic analysis also helped in reassigning 1,348 potential noncoding RNAs as bona fide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-coding messenger RNAs. Gene expression patterns at the RNA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels indicated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e sequencing was useful in capturing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s encoded by nuclear and organellar genomes alike. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic evidence provided an unbiased approach toward the identification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s encoded by organellar genomes. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are often missed in transcriptome data sets due to the enrichment of only messenger RNAs that contain poly(A) tails. Overall, the use of integrated omic approaches enhanced the quality of the assembly and annotation of this nonmodel plant genome. The availability of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data will enhance genomics-assisted breeding, germplasm characterization, and conservation of sandalwood trees.</p>

PROHIBITIN3 Forms Complexes with ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 to Regulate Stress-Induced Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a major defense signal in plants. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the chloroplast-localized isochorismate pathway is the main source of SA biosynthesis during abiotic stress or pathogen infections. In the first step of the pathway, the enzyme ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 (ICS1) converts chorismate to isochorismate. An unknown enzyme subsequently converts isochorismate to SA. Here, we show that ICS1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels increase during UV-C stress. To identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that may play roles in SA production by regulating ICS1, we analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that coimmunoprecipitated with ICS1 via mass spectrometry. The ICS1 complexes contained a large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es from the PROHIBITIN (PHB) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> family, with PHB3 the most abundant. PHB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s have diverse biological functions that include acting as scaffolds for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complex formation and stabilization. PHB3 was reported previously to localize to mitochondria. Using fractionation, protease protection, and live imaging, we show that PHB3 also localizes to chloroplasts, where ICS1 resides. Notably, loss of PHB3 function led to decreased ICS1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels in response to UV-C stress. However, <i>ICS1</i> transcript levels remain unchanged, indicating that ICS1 is regulated posttranscriptionally. The <i>phb3</i> mutant displayed reduced levels of SA, the SA-regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> PR1, and hypersensitive cell death in response to UV-C and avirulent strains of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and, correspondingly, supported increased growth of <i>P. syringae</i>. The expression of a <i>PHB3</i> transgene in the <i>phb3</i> mutant complemented all of these phenotypes. We suggest a model in which the formation of PHB3-ICS1 complexes stabilizes ICS1 to promote SA production in response to stress.</p>

Revisiting the Algal “Chloroplast Lipid Droplet”: The Absence of an Entity That Is Unlikely to Exist
<p>The precise localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets and the metabolic pathways associated with oil production are crucial to the engineering of microalgae for biofuel production. Several studies have reported detecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets within the chloroplast of the microalga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, which accumulates considerable amounts of triacylglycerol and starch within the cell under nitrogen deprivation or high-light stress conditions. Starch undoubtedly accumulates within the chloroplast, but there have been debates on the localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets, which are cytosolic organelles in other organisms. Although it is impossible to prove an absence, we tried to repeat experiments that previously indicated the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets in chloroplasts. Here, we present microscopic results showing no evidence for the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets within the chloroplast stroma, even though some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets existed in close association with the chloroplast or were largely engulfed by the chloroplasts. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets are cytosolic structures, distinct from the plastoglobules present in the chloroplast stroma. These results not only contrast with the old ideas but also point out that what were previously thought to be chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets are likely to be embedded within chloroplast invaginations in association with the outer envelope of the chloroplast without intervention of the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings point to the intriguing possibility of a tight metabolic flow from the chloroplast to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplet through a close association rather than direct contact of both organelles.</p>

The Prenylated Rab GTPase Receptor PRA1.F4 Contributes to Protein Exit from the Golgi Apparatus
<p>Prenylated Rab acceptor1 (PRA1) functions in the recruitment of prenylated Rab <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s to their cognate organelles. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains a large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s belonging to the AtPRA1 family. However, their physiological roles remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the physiological role of AtPRA1.F4, a member of the AtPRA1 family. A T-DNA insertion knockdown mutant of <i>AtPRA1.F4</i>, <i>atpra1.f4</i>, was smaller in stature than parent plants and possessed shorter roots, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing HA:AtPRA1.F4 showed enhanced development of secondary roots and root hairs. However, both overexpression and knockdown plants exhibited increased sensitivity to high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress, lower vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and plasma membrane ATPase activities, lower and higher pH in the vacuole and apoplast, respectively, and highly vesiculated Golgi apparatus. HA:AtPRA1.F4 localized to the Golgi apparatus and assembled into high-molecular-weight complexes. <i>atpra1.f4</i> plants displayed a defect in vacuolar trafficking, which was complemented by low but not high levels of <i>HA</i>:<i>AtPRA1.F4</i>. Overexpression of HA:AtPRA1.F4 also inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> trafficking at the Golgi apparatus, albeit differentially depending on the final destination or type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>: trafficking of vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, plasma membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, and trans-Golgi network (TGN)-localized SYP61 was strongly inhibited; trafficking of TGN-localized SYP51 was slightly inhibited; and trafficking of secretory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and TGN-localized SYP41 was negligibly or not significantly inhibited. Based on these results, we propose that Golgi-localized AtPRA1.F4 is involved in the exit of many but not all types of post-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s from the Golgi apparatus. Additionally, an appropriate level of AtPRA1.F4 is crucial for its function at the Golgi apparatus.</p>

Hydrocarbons Are Essential for Optimal Cell Size, Division, and Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>Cyanobacteria are intricately organized, incorporating an array of internal thylakoid membranes, the site of photosynthesis, into cells no larger than other bacteria. They also synthesize C15-C19 alkanes and alkenes, which results in substantial production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrocarbon</span></strong>s in the environment. All sequenced cyanobacteria encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrocarbon</span></strong> biosynthesis pathways, suggesting an important, undefined physiological role for these compounds. Here, we demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrocarbon</span></strong>-deficient mutants of <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 and <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 exhibit significant phenotypic differences from wild type, including enlarged cell size, reduced growth, and increased division defects. Photosynthetic rates were similar between strains, although a minor reduction in energy transfer between the soluble light harvesting phycobilisome complex and membrane-bound photosystems was observed. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrocarbon</span></strong>s were shown to accumulate in thylakoid and cytoplasmic membranes. Modeling of membranes suggests these compounds aggregate in the center of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> bilayer, potentially promoting membrane flexibility and facilitating curvature. In vivo measurements confirmed that <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 mutants lacking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrocarbon</span></strong>s exhibit reduced thylakoid membrane curvature compared to wild type. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrocarbon</span></strong>s may have a role in inducing the flexibility in membranes required for optimal cell division, size, and growth, and efficient association of soluble and membrane bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. The recent identification of C15-C17 alkanes and alkenes in microalgal species suggests <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrocarbon</span></strong>s may serve a similar function in a broad range of photosynthetic organisms.</p>

Protein structure determination using metagenome sequence data

We show that Rosetta structure prediction guided by residue-residue contacts inferred from evolutionary information can accurately model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that belong to large families and that metagenome sequence data more than triple the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> families with sufficient sequences for accurate modeling.

CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6: A Key Regulator of Na<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis during Germination
<p>Salinity impairs seed germination and seedling establishment. We investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6 (CAMTA6) in salinity stress responses during early germination. Compared with the wild type, the <i>camta6-4</i> and <i>camta6-5</i> mutants were more tolerant to NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA) and accumulated less Na<sup>+</sup>. In contrast, 4- to 11-d-old <i>camta6</i> seedlings were more sensitive to NaCl. In <i>camta6</i>, expression of <i>HIGH-AFFINITY K<sup>+</sup> TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>AtHKT1;1</i>), encoding an Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transporter, was restricted to the radicles and was not enhanced by NaCl or ABA. During germination, the <i>camta6 hkt1</i> double mutant was as sensitive as the wild type and <i>hkt1</i> to NaCl, suggesting that HKT1;1 is crucial for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance of <i>camta6</i>. An ABA response element in the <i>HKT1;1</i> promoter was found to be indispensable for the enhanced expression of the gene in response to NaCl and to ABA. Transcriptome analysis of the wild type and <i>camta6-5</i> with and without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> treatment revealed 1,020 up-regulated and 1,467 down-regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-responsive genes in the wild type. Among these, 638 up-regulated and 1,242 down-regulated genes were classified as CAMTA6-dependent. Expression of several known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress-associated genes, including <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i> and <i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ANTIPORTER</i>, was impaired in <i>camta6</i> mutants. Bioinformatics analysis of the 5′ upstream sequences of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-responsive CAMTA6-dependent up-regulated genes revealed the CACGTGTC motif as the most prominent element, representing an ABA response element and a potential CAMTA-binding site. We suggest that CAMTA6 regulates, directly or indirectly, the expression of most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-responsive genes in germinating seeds, including genes that are crucial for Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress tolerance.</p>

Modulating Protein Stability to Switch Toxic Protein Function On and Off in Living Cells
<p>Toxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are prime targets for molecular farming (the generation of pharmacologically active or biotechnologically usable compounds in plants) and are also efficient tools for targeted cell ablation in genetics, developmental biology, and biotechnology. However, achieving conditional activity of cytotoxins and maintaining the toxin-expressing plants as stably transformed lines remain challenging. Here, we produce a switchable version of the highly cytotoxic bacterial RNase barnase by fusing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> to a portable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation cassette, the low-temperature degron cassette. This method allows conditional genetics based on conditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation via the N-end rule or N-degron pathway and has been used to vice versa accumulate and/or deplete a diverse variety of highly active, unstable or stable target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in different living multicellular organisms and cell systems. Moreover, we expressed the barnase fusion under control of the trichome-specific <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> promoter. This enabled efficient temperature-dependent control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> accumulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf hairs (trichomes). By tuning the levels of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, we were able to control the fate of trichomes in vivo. The on-demand formation of trichomes through manipulating the balance between stabilization and destabilization of barnase provides proof of concept for a robust and powerful tool for conditional switchable cell arrest. We present this tool as a potential strategy for the manufacture and accumulation of cytotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and toxic high-value products in plants or for conditional genetic cell ablation.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, wh<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong> and how starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty acid synthesis via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coenzym</span></strong>e A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty acid peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty acids in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch synthesis and fatty acid turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty acid flux between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty acid β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty acid synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED Supports Translation under Stress and Interacts with the Ribosomal 30S Subunit
<p>Chloroplast ribosomes, which originated from cyanobacteria, comprise a large subunit (50S) and a small subunit (30S) containing ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and various ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Genes for many chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with auxiliary roles in ribosome biogenesis or functioning, reside in the nucleus. Here, we identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED (CRASS), a member of the latter class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, based on the tight coexpression of its mRNA with transcripts for nucleus-encoded chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. CRASS was acquired during the evolution of embryophytes and is localized to the chloroplast stroma. Loss of CRASS results in minor defects in development, photosynthetic efficiency, and chloroplast translation activity under controlled growth conditions, but these phenotypes are greatly exacerbated under stress conditions induced by the translational inhibitors lincomycin and chloramphenicol or by cold treatment. The CRASS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> comigrates with chloroplast ribosomal particles and coimmunoprecipitates with the 16S rRNA and several chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, particularly the plastid ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s of the 30S subunit (PRPS1 and PRPS5). The association of CRASS with PRPS1 and PRPS5 is independent of rRNA and is not detectable in yeast two-hybrid experiments, implying that either CRASS interacts indirectly with PRPS1 and PRPS5 via another component of the small ribosomal subunit or that it recognizes structural features of the multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>/rRNA particle. CRASS plays a role in the biogenesis and/or stability of the chloroplast ribosome that becomes critical under certain stressful conditions when ribosomal activity is compromised.</p>

GS<sup>yellow</sup>, a Multifaceted Tag for Functional Protein Analysis in Monocot and Dicot Plants
<p>The ability to tag <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s has boosted the emergence of generic molecular methods for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> functional analysis. Fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> tags are used to visualize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> localization, and affinity tags enable the mapping of molecular interactions by, for example, tandem affinity purification or chromatin immunoprecipitation. To apply these widely used molecular techniques on a single transgenic plant line, we developed a multifunctional tandem affinity purification tag, named GS<sup>yellow</sup>, which combines the streptavidin-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e tag with citrine yellow fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>. We demonstrated the versatility of the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag in the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a set of benchmark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. For proof of concept in monocots, we assessed the localization and dynamic interaction profile of the leaf growth regulator ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3), fused to the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag, along the growth zone of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf. To further explore the function of ZmAN3, we mapped its DNA-binding landscape in the growth zone of the maize leaf through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. Comparison with AN3 target genes mapped in the developing maize tassel or in Arabidopsis cell cultures revealed strong conservation of AN3 target genes between different maize tissues and across monocots and dicots, respectively. In conclusion, the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag offers a powerful molecular tool for distinct types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> functional analyses in dicots and monocots. As this approach involves transforming a single construct, it is likely to accelerate both basic and translational plant research.</p>

<i>Medicago</i> Plants Control Nodulation by Regulating Proteolysis of the Receptor-Like Kinase DMI2
<p>Plants use receptor-like kinases to monitor environmental changes and transduce signals into plant cells. The <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (hereafter <i>M</i>. <i>truncatula</i>) DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS2 (DMI2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> functions as a coreceptor of rhizobial signals to initiate nodule development and rhizobial infection during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, but the mechanisms regulating DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> level and folding are still unknown. Here, we report that DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> abundance changes during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. DMI2 accumulates in the nodules and is induced by rhizobia treatment through a posttranscriptional process. However, DMI2 induction is independent of the perception of Nod factor, a group of lipochitooligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia. The stability of the DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> is controlled by the proteasome pathway: in rhizobia-free environments, DMI2 is degraded by the proteasome, but during rhizobial infection, DMI2 is protected from the proteasome, resulting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> accumulation. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor-promoted accumulation of DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> in <i>Medicago</i> roots induces the expression of two early nodulation marker genes, supporting the hypothesis that DMI2 accumulation activates downstream symbiosis signaling. The extracellular region of DMI2 contains two malectin-like domains (MLDs) and a leucine-rich repeat. When conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>o acids in the MLDs are mutated, DMI2 fails to restore nodule development in <i>dmi2</i> mutants, and point-mutated MLD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are degraded constitutively, suggesting that the MLD may be vital for the accumulation of DMI2. Our findings suggest that legumes control nodule development through modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> level of DMI2, revealing a layer of regulation in the interaction between plants and rhizobia in nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.</p>

Out of Water: The Origin and Early Diversification of Plant <i>R</i>-Genes

Whereas <i>R</i>-genes have been well characterized in angiosperms, little is known about their origin and early diversification. Here, we perform comprehensive evolutionary analyses of <i>R</i>-genes in plants and report the identification of <i>R</i>-genes in basal-branching streptophytes, including charophytes, liverworts, and mosses. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that plant <i>R</i>-genes originated in charophytes and R-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s diversified into TIR-NBS-LRR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and non-TIR-NBS-LRR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in charophytes. Moreover, we show that plant R-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s evolved in a modular fashion through frequent gain or loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> domains. Most of the <i>R</i>-genes in basal-branching streptophytes underwent adaptive evolution, indicating an ancient involvement of <i>R</i>-genes in plant-pathogen interactions.

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome measures were (1) process measures at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study these associations with hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process measures than higher-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e hospitals. Higher hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>es with lower 6-month mortality (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective national quality improvement registry of older patients with HF indicates that hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e as a structural metric correlates with process measures, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up.

Obstruction of pilus retraction stimulates bacterial surface sensing
<p>It is critical for bacteria to recognize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact and initiate physiological changes required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-associated lifestyles. Ubiquitous microbial appendages called pili are involved in sensing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es and facilitating downstream behaviors, but the mechanism by which pili mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e sensing has been unclear. We visualized <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> pili undergoing dynamic cycles of extension and retraction. Within seconds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact, these cycles ceased, which coincided with synthesis of the adhesive holdfast required for attachment. Physically blocking pili imposed resistance to pilus retraction, which was sufficient to stimulate holdfast synthesis without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact. Thus, to sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, bacteria use the resistance on retracting, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-bound pili that occurs upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-active molecules that can lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es as well as insoluble lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants. Lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants showed strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e activity that reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Tunable intrinsic strain in two-dimensional transition metal electrocatalysts
<p>Tuning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e strain is a powerful strategy for tailoring the reactivity of metal catalysts. Traditionally, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e strain is imposed by external stress from a heterogeneous substrate, but the effect is often obscured by interfacial reconstructions and nanocatalyst <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>es. Here, we report on a strategy to resolve these problems by exploiting intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e stresses in two-dimensional transition metal nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations indicate that attractive interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e atoms lead to tensile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e stresses that exert a pressure on the order of 10<sup>5</sup> atmospheres on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e atoms and impart up to 10% compressive strain, with the exact magnitude inversely proportional to the nanosheet thickness. Atomic-level control of thickness thus enables generation and fine-tuning of intrinsic strain to optimize catalytic reactivity, which was confirmed experimentally on Pd(110) nanosheets for the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, with activity enhancements that were more than an order of magnitude greater than those of their nanoparticle counterparts.</p>

RORγt limits the amount of the cytokine receptor γc through the prosurvival factor Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in developing thymocytes
<p>The cytokine receptor subunit γc provides critical signals for T cell survival and differentiation. We investigated the molecular mechanism that controls the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e abundance of γc during T cell development in the thymus. We found that the amount of γc was low on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) thymocytes before their positive selection to become mature T cells. The transcription factor RORγt was abundant in immature DP thymocytes, and its loss resulted in an increase in the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc, specifically on preselection DP cells. Rather than directly repressing expression of the gene encoding γc, RORγt acted through the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> to reduce the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc, which resulted in decreased cytokine signaling and was associated with inhibition of cell metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, overexpression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in RORγt-deficient thymocytes restored the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc to that present on normal preselection DP cells. Together, these data highlight a previously unappreciated role for RORγt and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in limiting γc abundance at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e and reveal a signaling circuit in which survival factors control cytokine signaling by limiting the abundance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e distribution of a receptor subunit shared by several cytokines.</p>

Selective increase in CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction activity at grain-boundary surface terminations
<p>Altering a material’s catalytic properties requires identifying structural features that give rise to active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. Grain boundaries create strained regions in polycrystalline materials by stabilizing dislocations and may provide a way to create high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es for catalysis that are kinetically trapped. Although grain-boundary density has previously been correlated with catalytic activity for some reactions, direct evidence that grain boundaries create <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es with enhanced activity is lacking. We used a combination of bulk electrochemical measurements and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with submicrometer resolution to show that grain-boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e terminations in gold electrodes are more active than grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) reduction to carbon monoxide (CO) but not for the competing hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) evolution reaction. The catalytic footprint of the grain boundary is commensurate with its dislocation-induced strain field, providing a strategy for broader exploitation of grain-boundary effects in heterogeneous catalysis.</p>

Second messenger–mediated tactile response by a bacterial rotary motor
<p>When bacteria encounter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, they respond with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e colonization and virulence induction.

Here, we describe a tactile sensing cascade in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> in which the flagellar motor acts as sensor. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-induced motor interference stimulated the production of the second messenger cyclic diguanylate by the motor-associated diguanylate cyclase DgcB. This led to the allosteric activation of the glycosyltransferase HfsJ to promote rapid synthesis of a polysaccharide adhesin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e anchoring. Although the membrane-embedded motor unit was essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e sensing, mutants that lack external flagellar structures were hypersensitive to mechanical stimuli.

Relationship Between Lifelong Exercise Volume and Coronary Atherosclerosis in Athletes

Participants reported lifelong exercise history patterns. Exercise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>es were multiplied by metabolic equivalent of task (MET) scores to calculate MET-minutes per week.

Ligand-activated Notch undergoes DTX4-mediated ubiquitylation and bilateral endocytosis before ADAM10 processing
<p>The Notch signaling pathway, which is activated by cell-cell contact, is a major regulator of cell fate decisions. Mammalian Notch1 is present at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e as a heterodimer of the Notch extracellular domain associated with the transmembrane and intracellular domains. After ligand binding, Notch undergoes proteolysis, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that regulates gene expression. We monitored the early steps of activation with biochemical analysis, immunofluorescence analysis, and live-cell imaging of Notch1-expressing cells. We found that, upon ligand binding, Notch1 at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e was ubiquitylated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX4. This ubiquitylation event led to the internalization of the Notch1 extracellular domain by the ligand-expressing cell and the internalization of the membrane-anchored fragment of Notch1 and DTX4 by the Notch1-expressing cell, which we referred to as bilateral endocytosis. ADAM10 generates a cleavage product of Notch that is necessary for the formation of the NICD, which has been thought to occur at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. However, we found that blocking dynamin-mediated endocytosis of Notch1 and DTX4 reduced the colocalization of Notch1 with ADAM10 and the formation of the ADAM10-generated cleavage product of Notch1, suggesting that ADAM10 functions in an intracellular compartment to process Notch. Thus, this study suggests that a specific pool of ADAM10 acts on Notch in an endocytic compartment, rather than at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e.</p>

We demonstrated concurrent printing of all points within a three-dimensional object by illuminating a rotating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e of photosensitive material with a dynamically evolving light pattern.

Fluorine-programmed nanozipping to tailored nanographenes on rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces
<p>The rational synthesis of nanographenes and carbon nanoribbons directly on nonmetallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es has been an elusive goal for a long time. We report that activation of the carbon (C)–fluorine (F) bond is a reliable and versatile tool enabling intramolecular aryl-aryl coupling directly on metal oxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. A challenging multistep transformation enabled by C–F bond activation led to a dominolike coupling that yielded tailored nanographenes directly on the rutile titania <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. Because of efficient regioselective zipping, we obtained the target nanographenes from flexible precursors. Fluorine positions in the precursor structure unambiguously dictated the running of the “zipping program,” resulting in the rolling up of oligophenylene chains. The high efficiency of the hydrogen fluoride zipping makes our approach attractive for the rational synthesis of nanographenes and nanoribbons directly on insulating and semiconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es.</p>

Background levels of methane in Mars’ atmosphere show strong seasonal variations
<p>Variable levels of methane in the martian atmosphere have eluded explanation partly because the measurements are not repeatable in time or location. We report in situ measurements at Gale crater made over a 5-year period by the Tunable Laser Spectrometer on the Curiosity rover. The background levels of methane have a mean value 0.41 ± 0.16 parts per billion by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e (ppbv) (95% confidence interval) and exhibit a strong, repeatable seasonal variation (0.24 to 0.65 ppbv). This variation is greater than that predicted from either ultraviolet degradation of impact-delivered organics on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e or from the annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e pressure cycle. The large seasonal variation in the background and occurrences of higher temporary spikes (~7 ppbv) are consistent with small localized sources of methane released from martian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e or sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e reservoirs.</p>

Polarity compensation mechanisms on the perovskite surface KTaO<sub>3</sub>(001)
<p>The stacking of alternating charged planes in ionic crystals creates a diverging electrostatic energy—a “polar catastrophe”—that must be compensated at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. We used scanning probe microscopies and density functional theory to study compensation mechanisms at the perovskite potassium tantalate<i> </i>(KTaO<sub>3</sub>) (001) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e as increasing degrees of freedom were enabled. The as-cleaved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e in vacuum is frozen in place but immediately responds with an insulator-to-metal transition and possibly ferroelectric lattice distortions. Annealing in vacuum allows the formation of isolated oxygen vacancies, followed by a complete rearrangement of the top layers into an ordered pattern of KO and TaO<sub>2</sub> stripes. The optimal solution is found after exposure to water vapor through the formation of a hydroxylated overlayer with ideal geometry and charge.</p>

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p>Ice formation on aerosol particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level. This is partly because the nature of active sites, local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e features where ice growth commences, is still unclear. Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e, exposed at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e defects such as steps, cracks, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high ice nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar particles.</p>

Extensive water ice within Ceres’ aqueously altered regolith: Evidence from nuclear spectroscopy
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e elemental composition of dwarf planet Ceres constrains its regolith ice content, aqueous alteration processes, and interior evolution. Using nuclear spectroscopy data acquired by NASA’s Dawn mission, we determined the concentrations of elemental hydrogen, iron, and potassium on Ceres. The data show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e materials were processed by the action of water within the interior. The non-icy portion of Ceres’ carbon-bearing regolith contains similar amounts of hydrogen to those present in aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites; however, the concentration of iron on Ceres is lower than in the aforementioned chondrites. This allows for the possibility that Ceres experienced modest ice-rock fractionation, resulting in differences between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e and bulk composition. At mid-to-high latitudes, the regolith contains high concentrations of hydrogen, consistent with broad expanses of water ice, confirming theoretical predictions that ice can survive for billions of years just beneath the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e.</p>

Immediate and Midterm Cardiac Remodeling After Surgical Pulmonary Valve Replacement in Adults With Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot

The Fluid Mechanics of Transcatheter Heart Valve Leaflet Thrombosis in the Neosinus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transcatheter heart valve (THV) thrombosis has been increasingly reported.

Patients on anticoagulation were excluded. SAPIEN 3 and CoreValve/Evolut R patients with and without hypoattenuated leaflet thickening were included to study differences between groups. Patients were classified as having THV thrombosis if there was any evidence of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening. Anatomic and THV deployment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>es were analyzed, and thrombus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>es were computed through manual 3-dimensional reconstruction.

Dominant effect of relative tropical Atlantic warming on major hurricane occurrence
<p>Here we explore factors potentially linked to the enhanced major hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean during 2017. Using a suite of high-resolution model experiments, we show that the increase in 2017 major hurricanes was not primarily caused by La Niña conditions in the Pacific Ocean but rather triggered mainly by pronounced warm sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e conditions in the tropical North Atlantic. Further, we superimpose a similar pattern of North Atlantic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e warming on data for long-term increasing sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e temperature (a product of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations and decreases in aerosols) to show that this warming trend will likely lead to even higher numbers of major hurricanes in the future. The key factor controlling Atlantic major hurricane activity appears to be the degree to which the tropical Atlantic warms relative to the rest of the global ocean.</p>

High-affinity adsorption leads to molecularly ordered interfaces on TiO<sub>2</sub> in air and solution
<p>Researchers around the world have observed the formation of molecularly ordered structures of unknown origin on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e of titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) photocatalysts exposed to air and solution. Using a combination of atomic-scale microscopy and spectroscopy, we show that TiO<sub>2</sub> selectively adsorbs atmospheric carboxylic acids that are typically present in parts-per-billion concentrations while effectively repelling other adsorbates, such as alcohols, that are present in much higher concentrations. The high affinity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e for carboxylic acids is attributed to their bidentate binding. These self-assembled monolayers have the unusual property of being both hydrophobic and highly water-soluble, which may contribute to the self-cleaning properties of TiO<sub>2</sub>. This finding is relevant to TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysis, because the self-assembled carboxylate monolayers block the undercoordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e cation sites typically implicated in photocatalysis.</p>

Wallpaper fermions and the nonsymmorphic Dirac insulator

There exists only a very limited set of possible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e crystal symmetries, captured by the 17 “wallpaper groups.” Here we show that a consideration of symmetry-allowed band degeneracies in the wallpaper groups can be used to understand previously described topological crystalline insulators and to predict phenomenologically distinct examples. In particular, the two wallpaper groups with multiple glide lines, <i>pgg</i> and <i>p</i>4<i>g</i>, allow for a topological insulating phase whose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e spectrum consists of only a single, fourfold-degenerate, true Dirac fermion, representing an exception to a symmetry-enhanced fermion-doubling theorem.

Ultralarge elastic deformation of nanoscale diamond
<p>Diamonds have substantial hardness and durability, but attempting to deform diamonds usually results in brittle fracture. We demonstrate ultralarge, fully reversible elastic deformation of nanoscale (~300 nanometers) single-crystalline and polycrystalline diamond needles. For single-crystalline diamond, the maximum tensile strains (up to 9%) approached the theoretical elastic limit, and the corresponding maximum tensile stress reached ~89 to 98 gigapascals. After combining systematic computational simulations and characterization of pre- and postdeformation structural features, we ascribe the concurrent high strength and large elastic strain to the paucity of defects in the small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e diamond nanoneedles and to the relatively smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es compared with those of microscale and larger specimens.

Observation of topological superconductivity on the surface of an iron-based superconductor
<p>Topological superconductors are predicted to host exotic Majorana states that obey non-Abelian statistics and can be used to implement a topological quantum computer. Most of the proposed topological superconductors are realized in difficult-to-fabricate heterostructures at very low temperatures. By using high-resolution spin-resolved and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, we find that the iron-based superconductor FeTe<sub>1–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>Se<i><sub>x</sub></i> (<i>x</i> = 0.45; superconducting transition temperature <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 14.5 kelvin) hosts Dirac-cone–type spin-helical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e states at the Fermi level; the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e states exhibit an s-wave superconducting gap below <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>.

Convergent evidence for widespread rock nitrogen sources in Earth’s surface environment
<p>Nitrogen availability is a pivotal control on terrestrial carbon sequestration and global climate change. Historical and contemporary views assume that nitrogen enters Earth’s land-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e ecosystems from the atmosphere. Here we demonstrate that bedrock is a nitrogen source that rivals atmospheric nitrogen inputs across major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sector</span></strong>s of the global terrestrial environment. Evidence drawn from the planet’s nitrogen balance, geochemical proxies, and our spatial weathering model reveal that ~19 to 31 teragrams of nitrogen are mobilized from near-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e rocks annually. About 11 to 18 teragrams of this nitrogen are chemically weathered in situ, thereby increasing the unmanaged (preindustrial) terrestrial nitrogen balance from 8 to 26%. These findings provide a global perspective to reconcile Earth’s nitrogen budget, with implications for nutrient-driven controls over the terrestrial carbon sink.</p>

Self-heating–induced healing of lithium dendrites
<p>Lithium (Li) metal electrodes are not deployable in rechargeable batteries because electrochemical plating and stripping invariably leads to growth of dendrites that reduce coulombic efficiency and eventually short the battery. It is generally accepted that the dendrite problem is exacerbated at high current densities. Here, we report a regime for dendrite evolution in which the reverse is true. In our experiments, we found that when the plating and stripping current density is raised above ~9 milliamperes per square centimeter, there is substantial self-heating of the dendrites, which triggers extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e migration of Li. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e diffusion heals the dendrites and smoothens the Li metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e.

Hydraulic fracturing volume is associated with induced earthquake productivity in the Duvernay play
<p>A sharp increase in the frequency of earthquakes near Fox Creek, Alberta, began in December 2013 in response to hydraulic fracturing. Using a hydraulic fracturing database, we explore relationships between injection parameters and seismicity response. We show that induced earthquakes are associated with completions that used larger injection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>es (10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> cubic meters) and that seismic productivity scales linearly with injection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e. Injection pressure and rate have an insignificant association with seismic response. Further findings suggest that geological factors play a prominent role in seismic productivity, as evidenced by spatial correlations. Together, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e and geological factors account for ~96% of the variability in the induced earthquake rate near Fox Creek. This result is quantified by a seismogenic index–modified frequency-magnitude distribution, providing a framework to forecast induced seismicity.</p>

Femtosecond laser reshaping yields gold nanorods with ultranarrow surface plasmon resonances
<p>The irradiation of gold nanorod colloids with a femtosecond laser can be tuned to induce controlled nanorod reshaping, yielding colloids with exceptionally narrow localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e plasmon resonance bands. The process relies on a regime characterized by a gentle multishot reduction of the aspect ratio, whereas the rod shape and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e are barely affected. Successful reshaping can only occur within a narrow window of the heat dissipation rate: Low cooling rates lead to drastic morphological changes, and fast cooling has nearly no effect. Hence, a delicate balance must be achieved between irradiation fluence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e density of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tant on the nanorods. This perfection process is appealing because it provides a simple, fast, reproducible, and scalable route toward gold nanorods with an optical response of exceptional quality, near the theoretical limit.</p>

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

Nonreciprocity originates from unidirectional edge states at the boundary between photonic structures with distinct topological invariants.

Acoustic mirrors as sensory traps for bats
<p>Sensory traps pose a considerable and often fatal risk for animals, leading them to misinterpret their environment. Bats predominantly rely on their echolocation system to forage, orientate, and navigate. We found that bats can mistake smooth, vertical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es as clear flight paths, repeatedly colliding with them, likely as a result of their acoustic mirror properties. The probability of collision is influenced by the number of echolocation calls and by the amount of time spent in front of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. The echolocation call analysis corroborates that bats perceive smooth, vertical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es as open flyways. Reporting on occurrences with different species in the wild, we argue that it is necessary to more closely monitor potentially dangerous locations with acoustic mirror properties (such as glass fronts) to assess the true frequency of fatalities around these sensory traps.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is one of the most abundant species in cometary nuclei, but because of its high volatility, CO<sub>2</sub> ice is generally only found beneath the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. We report the infrared spectroscopic identification of a CO<sub>2</sub> ice–rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e area located in the Anhur region of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Spectral modeling shows that about 0.1% of the 80- by 60-meter area is CO<sub>2</sub> ice. This exposed ice was observed a short time after the comet exited local winter; following the increased illumination, the CO<sub>2</sub> ice completely disappeared over about 3 weeks. We estimate the mass of the sublimated CO<sub>2</sub> ice and the depth of the eroded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e layer. We interpret the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> ice as the result of the extreme seasonal changes induced by the rotation and orbit of the comet.</p>

Ultrafine jagged platinum nanowires enable ultrahigh mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction
<p>Improving the platinum (Pt) mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) requires optimization of both the specific activity and the electrochemically active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e area (ECSA). We found that solution-synthesized Pt/NiO core/shell nanowires can be converted into PtNi alloy nanowires through a thermal annealing process and then transformed into jagged Pt nanowires via electrochemical dealloying. The jagged nanowires exhibit an ECSA of 118 square meters per gram of Pt and a specific activity of 11.5 milliamperes per square centimeter for ORR (at 0.9 volts versus reversible hydrogen electrode), yielding a mass activity of 13.6 amperes per milligram of Pt, nearly double previously reported best values. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations suggest that highly stressed, undercoordinated rhombus-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e configurations of the jagged nanowires enhance ORR activity versus more relaxed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es.</p>

A Multilevel Study of Melon Fruit Reticulation Provides Insight into Skin Ligno-Suberization Hallmarks
<p>The skin of fleshy fruit is typically covered by a thick cuticle. Some fruit species develop different forms of layers directly above their skin. Reticulation, for example, is a specialized suberin-based coating that ornaments some commercially important melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) fruit and is an important quality trait. Despite its importance, the structural, molecular, and biochemical features associated with reticulation are not fully understood. Here, we performed a multilevel investigation of structural attributes, chemical composition, and gene expression profiles on a set of reticulated and smooth skin melons. High-resolution microscopy, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e profiling, and histochemical staining assays show that reticulation comprises cells with heavily suberized walls accumulating large amounts of typical suberin monomers, as well as lignified cells localized underneath the specialized suberized cell layer. Reticulated skin was characterized by induced expression of biosynthetic genes acting in the core phenylpropanoid, suberin, lignin, and lignan pathways. Transcripts of genes associated with lipid polymer assembly, cell wall organization, and loosening were highly enriched in reticulated skin tissue. These signatures were exclusive to reticulated structures and absent in both the smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es observed in between reticulated regions and in the skin of smooth fruit. Our data provide important insights into the molecular and metabolic bases of reticulation and its tight association with skin ligno-suberization during melon fruit development. Moreover, these insights are likely to contribute to melon breeding programs aimed at improving postharvest qualities associated with fleshy fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e layers.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin transport is involved in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its rigidity and structural integrity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale forces that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold screw conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold screw conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving forces on the structural integrity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

Synthesis and Self-Assembly of Cellulose Microfibrils from Reconstituted Cellulose Synthase
<p>Cellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, can be converted to bioethanol and is thus highly studied. In plants, cellulose is produced by cellulose synthase, a processive family-2 glycosyltransferase. In plant cell walls, individual β-1,4-glucan chains polymerized by CesA are assembled into microfibrils that are frequently bundled into macrofibrils. An in vitro system in which cellulose is synthesized and assembled into fibrils would facilitate detailed study of this process. Here, we report the heterologous expression and partial purification of His-tagged CesA5 from <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Immunoblot analysis and mass spectrometry confirmed enrichment of PpCesA5. The recombinant protein was functional when reconstituted into liposomes made from yeast total lipid extract. The functional studies included incorporation of radiolabeled Glc, linkage analysis, and imaging of cellulose microfibril formation using transmission electron microscopy. Several microfibrils were observed either inside or on the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e of proteoliposomes, and strikingly, several thinner fibrils formed ordered bundles that either covered the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es of proteoliposomes or were spawned from liposome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. We also report this arrangement of fibrils made by proteoliposomes bearing CesA8 from hybrid aspen. These observations describe minimal systems of membrane-reconstituted CesAs that polymerize β-1,4-glucan chains that coalesce to form microfibrils and higher-ordered macrofibrils. How these micro- and macrofibrils relate to those found in primary and secondary plant cell walls is uncertain, but their presence enables further study of the mechanisms that govern the formation and assembly of fibrillar cellulosic structures and cell wall composites during or after the polymerization process controlled by CesA proteins.</p>

Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by increasing bone mass under increased mechanical loads. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical bone response to applied load decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous bone, the tissue most impacted by age-related bone loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> tibial loading model to characterize the load-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-bone responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied load on tibial morphology and stiffness were determined using microcomputed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> bone strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied loading. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied load produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the loaded tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. Load-induced tibial stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following loading, which corresponded to increased <i>in vivo</i> tibial stiffness. Stiffness in the loaded tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting load-induced changes in bone material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-bone functional stiffness.</p>

A dynamic cell adhesion surface regulates tissue architecture in growth plate cartilage
<p>The architecture and morphogenetic properties of tissues are founded in the tissue-specific regulation of cell behaviors. In endochondral bones, the growth plate cartilage promotes bone elongation via regulated chondrocyte maturation within an ordered, three-dimensional cell array. A key event in the process that generates this cell array is the transformation of disordered resting chondrocytes into clonal columns of discoid proliferative cells aligned with the primary growth vector. Previous analysis showed that column-forming chondrocytes display planar cell divisions, and the resulting daughter cells rearrange by ∼90° to align with the lengthening column. However, these previous studies provided limited information about the mechanisms underlying this dynamic process. Here we present new mechanistic insights generated by application of a novel time-lapse confocal microscopy method along with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We show that, during cell division, daughter chondrocytes establish a cell-cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e enriched in cadherins and β-catenin. Rearrangement into columns occurs concomitant with expansion of this adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e in a process more similar to cell spreading than to migration. Column formation requires cell-cell adhesion, as reducing cadherin binding via chelation of extracellular calcium inhibits chondrocyte rearrangement. Importantly, physical indicators of cell polarity, such as cell body alignment, are not prerequisites for oriented cell behavior. Our results support a model in which regulation of adhesive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e dynamics and cortical tension by extrinsic signaling modifies the thermodynamic landscape to promote organization of daughter cells in the context of the three-dimensional growth plate tissue.</p>

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) target for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between diffusion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included diffusion-weighted imaging–evaluated total number of new ischemic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) years in the low-target group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) years in the high-target group (n=98). Procedural risk scores were comparable between groups. Overall, diffusion-weighted imaging revealed new cerebral lesions in 52.8% of patients in the low-target group versus 55.7% in the high-target group (<i>P</i>=0.76). The primary outcome of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e of new cerebral lesions was comparable between groups, 25 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–118 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–25 261 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the low-target group versus 29 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–143 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–22 116 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the high-target group (median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, −25 to 0.028; <i>P</i>=0.99), as was the secondary outcome of number of new lesions (1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–24] versus 1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–29] respectively; median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, 0–0; <i>P</i>=0.71). No significant difference was observed in frequency of severe adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery, targeting a higher versus a lower mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass did not seem to affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e or number of new cerebral infarcts.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. The development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention control (control; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by curve fit of the diastolic pressure-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e curve. Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) was measured to quantify changes in fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; control: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in controls (group×time <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e (group×time <i>P</i><0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was unchanged, providing greater stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e for any given filling pressure (loading×group×time <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and decreased cardiac stiffness. Regular exercise training may provide protection against the future risk of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction by preventing the increase in cardiac stiffness attributable to sedentary aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Prognostic Implications of Magnetic Resonance–Derived Quantification in Asymptomatic Patients With Organic Mitral Regurgitation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate method for the quantitative assessment of organic mitral regurgitation (OMR). The aim of the present study was to compare the discriminative power of MRI quantification and the recommended Doppler echocardiography (ECHO)–derived integrative approach to identify asymptomatic patients with OMR and adverse outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population consisted of 258 asymptomatic patients (63±14 years, 60% men) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (>60%) and chronic moderate and severe OMR (flail 25%, prolapse 75%) defined by using the ECHO-derived integrative approach. All patients underwent MRI to quantify regurgitant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e (RV) of OMR by subtracting the aortic forward flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e from the total left ventricular stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e. Severe OMR was defined as RV≥60 mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean ECHO-derived RV was on average 17.1 mL larger than the MRI-derived RV (<i>P</i><0.05). Concordant grading of OMR severity with both techniques was observed in 197 (76%) individuals with 62 (31%) patients having severe OMR (MRI SEV-ECHO SEV) and 135 (69%) patients having moderate OMR (MRI MOD-ECHO MOD). The remaining 61 (24%) individuals had discordant findings (MRI SEV-ECHO MOD or MRI MOD-ECHO SEV) between the 2 techniques. The majority of these differences in OMR classification were observed in patients with late systolic or multiple jets (both κ<0.2). Patients with eccentric jets showed moderate agreement (κ=0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.64). In contrast, a very good agreement (κ=0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.98) was observed in a combination of holosystolic, central, and single jet. During a median follow-up of 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.5–6.0 years), 38 (15%) patients died and 106 (41%) either died or developed indication for mitral valve surgery. In separate Cox regression analyses, the MRI-derived left ventricular end-systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e index, RV, and OMR category (severe versus moderate), and the ECHO-derived OMR category were independent predictors of all-cause mortality (all <i>P</i><0.05). The MRI-derived RV showed the largest area under the curve to predict mortality (0.72) or its combination with the development of indication for mitral valve surgery (0.83).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The findings of the present study suggest that the MRI-derived assessment of OMR can better identify patients with severe OMR and adverse outcome than ECHO-derived integrative approach warranting close follow-up and perhaps, early mitral valve surgery.</p></sec>

Increase in Endovascular Therapy in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke After the Publication of Pivotal Trials
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Beginning in December 2014, a series of pivotal trials showed that endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was highly effective, prompting calls to reorganize stroke systems of care. However, there are few data on how these trials influenced the frequency of EVT in clinical practice. We used data from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke program to determine how the frequency of EVT changed in US practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed prospectively collected data from a cohort of 2 437 975 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to 2222 participating hospitals between April 2003 and the third quarter of 2016. Weighted linear regression with 2 linear splines and a knot at January 2015 was used to compare the slope of the change in EVT use before and after the pivotal trials were published. Potentially eligible patients were defined as last known well to arrival time ≤4.5 hours and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The frequency of EVT use was slowly increasing before January 2015 but then sharply accelerated thereafter. In the third quarter 2016, EVT was provided to 3.3% of all patients with ischemic stroke at all hospitals, representing 15.1% of all patients who were potentially eligible for EVT based on stroke duration and severity. At EVT-capable hospitals, 7.5% of all patients with ischemic stroke were treated in the third quarter of 2016, including 27.3% of the potentially eligible patients. From 2013 to 2016, case <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>es nearly doubled at EVT-capable hospitals. Mean case <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e per EVT-capable hospital was 37.6 per year in the last 4 quarters. EVT case <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>es increased in nearly all US states from 2014 to the last 4 quarters, but with persistent geographic variation unexplained by differences in potential patient eligibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>EVT use is increasing rapidly; however, there are still opportunities to treat more patients. Reorganizing stroke systems to route patients to adequately resourced EVT-capable hospitals might increase treatment of eligible patients, improve outcomes, and reduce disparities.</p></sec>

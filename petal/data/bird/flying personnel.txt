Is computer navigation when used in the surgery of iliosacral pelvic bone tumours safer for the patient?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Due to the complex anatomy of the pelvis, limb-sparing resections   of pelvic tumours achieving adequate surgical margins, can often   be difficult. The advent of computer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ation has improved the   precision of resection of these lesions, though there is little   evidence comparing resection with or without the assistance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ation.</p><p>Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ation-assisted surgery   for the resection of pelvic bone tumours involving the posterior   ilium and sacrum. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using our prospectively updated institutional database, we conducted   a retrospective case control study of 21 patients who underwent   resection of the posterior ilium and sacrum, for the treatment of   a primary sarcoma of bone, between 1987 and 2015.

We assessed the accuracy of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ation-assisted   surgery, as defined by the surgical margin and how this affects   the rate of local recurrence, the disease-free survival and the   effects on peri-and post-operative morbidity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the patients was 36.4 years (15 to 66).

Remembered reward locations restructure entorhinal spatial maps
<p>Ethologically relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ational strategies often incorporate remembered reward locations. Although neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex provide a maplike representation of the external spatial world, whether this map integrates information regarding learned reward locations remains unknown. We compared entorhinal coding in rats during a free-foraging task and a spatial memory task. Entorhinal spatial maps restructured to incorporate a learned reward location, which in turn improved positional decoding near this location. This finding indicates that different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ational strategies drive the emergence of discrete entorhinal maps of space and points to a role for entorhinal codes in a diverse range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ational behaviors.</p>

Vectorial representation of spatial goals in the hippocampus of bats
<p>To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ate, animals need to represent not only their own position and orientation, but also the location of their goal. Neural representations of an animal’s own position and orientation have been extensively studied. However, it is unknown how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ational goals are encoded in the brain. We recorded from hippocampal CA1 neurons of bats flying in complex trajectories toward a spatial goal. We discovered a subpopulation of neurons with angular tuning to the goal direction. Many of these neurons were tuned to an occluded goal, suggesting that goal-direction representation is memory-based. We also found cells that encoded the distance to the goal, often in conjunction with goal direction. The goal-direction and goal-distance signals make up a vectorial representation of spatial goals, suggesting a previously unrecognized neuronal mechanism for goal-directed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ation.</p>

Neural representations across species
<p>A plethora of studies in rodents have described spatially tuned neurons, including place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), suggesting a crucial role of the hippocampal formation in spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ation (<i>1</i>). Human studies have, in turn, shown that the hippocampal formation is involved in declarative memory (memories of facts and events) (<i>2</i>). What, then, is the function of the hippocampus? Is it involved in memory or in spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ation, or does it have a more general function that encompasses both? Several studies have shown that place cells remap, changing the location at which they respond, following geometrical changes in the environment, and that they can be modulated by nonspatial factors, according to the animals' specific tasks (<i>3</i>). These findings highlight the coding of cognitive components, challenging the notion that place cells represent an invariant spatial map. Although grid cells also realign with physical changes in the environment (<i>4</i>), the geometrical structure of their fields has been considered to provide a more invariant spatial representation. But do grid cells encode cognitive aspects as well? On pages 1443 and 1447 of this issue, Boccara <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) and Butler <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>), respectively, show that this is the case, providing compelling evidence that grid cells are modulated by reward location. Complementing these studies, Baraduc <i>et al.</i> (<i>7</i>) showed that variations in spatially tuned neurons in the monkey hippocampus are accompanied by a “schema” of the task. Together these studies provide insights on how neurons in the hippocampal formation go beyond purely spatial representations and are modulated by cognitive factors.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the mechanism of generating water motion by mouth suction.</p>

Chemoattractant concentration–dependent tuning of ERK signaling dynamics in migrating neutrophils
<p>The directed migration (chemotaxis) of neutrophils toward the bacterial peptide <i>N</i>-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (<i>f</i>MLP) is a crucial process in immune defense against invading bacteria. While <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ating through a gradient of increasing concentrations of <i>f</i>MLP, neutrophils and neutrophil-like HL-60 cells switch from exhibiting directional migration at low <i>f</i>MLP concentrations to exhibiting circuitous migration at high <i>f</i>MLP concentrations. The extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is implicated in balancing this <i>f</i>MLP concentration–dependent switch in migration modes. We investigated the role and regulation of ERK signaling through single-cell analysis of neutrophil migration in response to different <i>f</i>MLP concentrations over time. We found that ERK exhibited gradated, rather than all-or-none, responses to <i>f</i>MLP concentration. Maximal ERK activation occurred in response to about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP, and ERK inactivation was promoted by p38. Furthermore, we found that directional migration of neutrophils reached a maximal extent at about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP and that ERK, but not p38, was required for neutrophil migration. Thus, our data suggest that, in chemotactic neutrophils responding to <i>f</i>MLP, ERK displays gradated activation and p38-dependent inhibition and that these ERK dynamics promote neutrophil migration.</p>

Slowing blood flow to fight viral infection
<p>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes are the assassins of the immune system, delivering cell death through direct interactions with virally infected or cancerous cells. To successfully execute their mission, these CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells must <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ate a number of key steps, including sensing and entering infected tissues, locating infected cells in the vast tissue space, and supplying the precise mediators or interactions needed to elicit target cell death. Failure, or viral interference, at any of these steps can have devastating consequences for the host, including the establishment of viral persistence. Although some of the pathways and mechanisms involved in T cell purging of viral infection are well understood, the rate of local blood flow in the infected tissue has not been carefully explored as a factor mediating viral clearance. On page 639 of this issue, Cox <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) demonstrate that T cells express the prototypical neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), which dilates blood vessels, slowing blood flow enough to enhance T cell entry into infected tissues and ultimately allowing clearance of chronic viral infection.</p>

A surface gravity traverse on Mars indicates low bedrock density at Gale crater
<p>Gravimetry, the precise measurement of gravitational fields, can be used to probe the internal structure of Earth and other planets. The Curiosity rover on Mars carries accelerometers normally used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ation and attitude determination. We have recalibrated them to isolate the signature of the changing gravitational acceleration as the rover climbs through Gale crater. The subsurface rock density is inferred from the measured decrease in gravitational field strength with elevation. The density of the sedimentary rocks in Gale crater is 1680 ± 180 kilograms per cubic meter. This value is lower than expected, indicating a high porosity and constraining maximum burial depths of the rocks over their history.</p>

Worries about Ebola outbreak grow, despite use of vaccine
<p>There's growing concern about an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that surfaced in August and, despite a coordinated response that has included vaccinating more than 40,000 people, persists. Although it's not being formally evaluated, the vaccine appears to be having an impact, says Peter Salama, who coordinates the response for the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. But the outbreak in the northeastern region of the country is taking place in an area that has long suffered from armed conflict, which repeatedly has brought Ebola response teams to a halt. The outbreak has had some 500 cases, about half of which have resulted in death, making it the second largest Ebola outbreak on record. The largest, which took place in West Africa from 2014 to 2016, was considerably larger—28,000 cases, 11,000 deaths—but there is fear that if the international community does not do more to help the DRC by sending experienced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">personnel</span></strong> and more money, the outbreak could continue its spread—and could easily breach borders to neighboring countries. Editorials in two leading medical journals urge the United States government in particular to change a policy that, for safety reasons, bars staff from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from traveling to the DRC and helping in the affected region.</p>

Efficient cortical coding of 3D posture in freely behaving rats
<p>Animals constantly update their body posture to meet behavioral demands, but little is known about the neural signals on which this depends. We therefore tracked freely foraging rats in three dimensions while recording from the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the frontal motor cortex (M2), areas critical for movement planning and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ation. Both regions showed strong tuning to posture of the head, neck, and back, but signals for movement were much less dominant. Head and back representations were organized topographically across the PPC and M2, and more neurons represented postures that occurred less often. Simultaneous recordings across areas were sufficiently robust to decode ongoing behavior and showed that spiking in the PPC tended to precede that in M2. Both the PPC and M2 strongly represent posture by using a spatially organized, energetically efficient population code.</p>

Supracellular contractions propel migration
<p>Constructing multicellular bodies, starting from a single-cell zygote, often requires the movement of cells across considerable distances, which is achieved through cell migration. During embryonic development, as well as in healing and regeneration, cells travel across diverse terrains, which dictates the character of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ation (<i>1</i>). Cancer cells metastasize and migrate into healthy organs, and knowledge of their migration strategies could be important to identify targets to treat advanced disease (<i>2</i>). Some migratory cells cover large distances individually (<i>3</i>), whereas others migrate in groups, with leaders and followers being directed by chemical signals (chemotaxis) (<i>4</i>, <i>5</i>). The exchange of information and resulting motility of such groups has been enigmatic. Moreover, the driving force of collective cell migration has been considered a sum of migratory and signaling activities of individually participating cells. However, according to a study on page 339 of this issue by Shellard <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>), collective cell migration requires formation of cytoskeletal structures that span through adjoining cells at the rear of a cell group to coordinate, orient, and propel the entire group. This mechanism of collective cell migration could be applicable to cancer metastasis and wound healing and might change our understanding of developmental migration.</p>

Brain scientists dive into deep neural networks

Until recently, artificial intelligence couldn't come anywhere close to human performance on tasks like recognizing sounds or classifying images. But deep neural networks, loosely inspired by the brain, have logged increasingly impressive performances, especially on visual tasks. That has led some neuroscientists to wonder whether these models could yield insight into how our own brains process information.</p>

Some unaffected diplomats from the Havana embassy agree. But a few researchers are finding hints of a physical cause for the symptoms, which include headaches, dizziness, and insomnia.

From local collective behavior to global migratory patterns in white storks
<p>Soaring migrant birds exploit columns of rising air (thermals) to cover large distances with minimal energy. Using social information while locating thermals may benefit such birds, but examining collective movements in wild migrants has been a major challenge for researchers. We investigated the group movements of a flock of 27 naturally migrating juvenile white storks by using high-resolution GPS and accelerometers. Analyzing individual and group movements on multiple scales revealed that a small number of leaders <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ated to and explored thermals, whereas followers benefited from their movements. Despite this benefit, followers often left thermals earlier and at lower height, and consequently they had to flap considerably more. Followers also migrated less far annually than did leaders. We provide insights into the interactions between freely flying social migrants and the costs and benefits of collective movement in natural populations.</p>

Ultrafast optical ranging using microresonator soliton frequency combs

Acoustic mirrors as sensory traps for bats
<p>Sensory traps pose a considerable and often fatal risk for animals, leading them to misinterpret their environment. Bats predominantly rely on their echolocation system to forage, orientate, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ate. We found that bats can mistake smooth, vertical surfaces as clear flight paths, repeatedly colliding with them, likely as a result of their acoustic mirror properties. The probability of collision is influenced by the number of echolocation calls and by the amount of time spent in front of the surface. The echolocation call analysis corroborates that bats perceive smooth, vertical surfaces as open flyways. Reporting on occurrences with different species in the wild, we argue that it is necessary to more closely monitor potentially dangerous locations with acoustic mirror properties (such as glass fronts) to assess the true frequency of fatalities around these sensory traps.</p>

A Trace of Your Place
<p>How do you know where you are? How do you generate or remember a mental map of your surroundings? Spatial cognition arises from multiple neural systems in the brain that converge to provide this awareness. Teasing out the origin of brain signals that course through these networks is tremendously difficult because the number and nature of pathways in the brain that give rise to a particular signal—the afferent inputs—are often not known. This becomes even more complicated if one looks for connectivity along these pathways at the level of single neurons, the most elementary operating units in the brain, because of the thousands of connections a neuron can make with other neurons. On page 44 of this issue, Zhang <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) tackle this question by identifying the afferent cells in the entorhinal cortex—a region associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ation and memory—that send signals to the hippocampus, specifically to “place cells,” neurons that become active in response to a specific location in an environment. The scheme that emerges establishes functional connectivity at an unprecedented level of detail.</p>

Gametophytic Pollen Tube Guidance: Attractant Peptides, Gametic Controls, and Receptors
<p>Pollen tube guidance in flowering plants is a unique and critical process for successful sexual reproduction. The pollen tube that grows from pollen, which is the male gametophyte, precisely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navig</span></strong>ates to the embryo sac, which is the female gametophyte, within the pistil. Recent advances have clarified the molecular framework of gametophytic pollen tube guidance. Multiple species-specific attractant peptides are secreted from synergid cells, the proper development and function of which are regulated by female gametes. Multiple receptor-like kinases on the pollen tube tip are involved in sensing species-specific attractant peptides. In this Update article, recent progress in our understanding of the mechanism of gametophytic pollen tube guidance is reviewed, including attraction by synergid cells, control of pollen tube guidance by female gametes, and directional growth of the pollen tube by directional cue sensing. Future directions in the study of pollen tube guidance also are discussed.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an inbred line of <i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>, an allotetraploid crop with great environmental adaptability and outstanding nutritional properties
<p><i>Chenopodium quinoa</i> Willd. (quinoa) originated from the Andean region of South America, and is a pseudocereal crop of the Amaranthaceae family. Quinoa is emerging as an important crop with the potential to contribute to food security worldwide and is considered to be an optimal food source for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">astronaut</span></strong>s, due to its outstanding nutritional profile and ability to tolerate stressful environments. Furthermore, plant pathologists use quinoa as a representative diagnostic host to identify virus species. However, molecular analysis of quinoa is limited by its genetic heterogeneity due to outcrossing and its genome complexity derived from allotetraploidy. To overcome these obstacles, we established the inbred and standard quinoa accession Kd that enables rigorous molecular analysis, and presented the draft genome sequence of Kd, using an optimized combination of high-throughput next generation sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 and PacBio RS II sequencers. The <i>de novo</i> genome assembly contained 25 k scaffolds consisting of 1 Gbp with N50 length of 86 kbp. Based on these data, we constructed the free-access Quinoa Genome DataBase (QGDB). Thus, these findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying agronomically important traits of quinoa and the effect of allotetraploidy on genome evolution.</p>

Duration of Prehospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Favorable Neurological Outcomes for Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The appropriate duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) remains unclear and may differ based on initial rhythm. We aimed to determine the relationship between the duration of prehospital CPR by emergency medical services (EMS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">personnel</span></strong> and post-OHCA outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the records of 12 877 pediatric patients who experienced OHCAs (<18 years of age). Data were recorded in a nationwide Japanese database between 2005 and 2012. Study end points were 30-day survival and 30-day survival with favorable neurological outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] scale 1–2). Prehospital EMS-initiated CPR duration was defined as the time from CPR initiation by EMS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">personnel</span></strong> to prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or to hospital arrival when prehospital ROSC was not achieved during prehospital CPR efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rates of 30-day survival and 30-day CPC 1 to 2 were 9.1% (n=1167) and 2.5% (n=325), respectively. Prehospital EMS-initiated CPR duration was significantly and inversely associated with 30-day outcomes (adjusted odds ratio for 1-minute increments: 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.93–0.95 for survival; adjusted odds ratio: 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.88–0.92 for CPC 1–2). The duration of prehospital EMS-initiated CPR, beyond which the chance for favorable outcomes diminished to <1%, was 42 minutes for each key outcome, 30-day survival, and 30-day survival with CPC 1 to 2. When categorized by initial rhythm, the prehospital EMS-initiated CPR durations beyond which the chance for 30-day survival with CPC 1 to 2 diminished to <1% were 39 minutes for shockable rhythms, 42 minutes for pulseless electric activity, and 46 minutes for asystole, respectively. In patients with bystander-initiated CPR, the prehospital CPR duration, beyond which the chance for favorable outcome diminished to <1%, was 46 minutes from call receipt.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Prehospital EMS-initiated CPR duration for pediatric OHCAs was independently and inversely associated with 30-day favorable outcomes. The duration of prehospital EMS-initiated CPR, beyond which the chance for 30-day favorable outcomes diminished to <1%, was 42 minutes. However, the CPR duration to achieve this proportion of outcomes differed based on initial rhythm. Further research is required to elucidate appropriate CPR duration for pediatric OHCAs, including in-hospital CPR time.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Impact of Combat Deployment and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder on Newly Reported Coronary Heart Disease Among US Active Duty and Reserve Forces
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have exposed thousands of service members to intense stress, and as a result, many have developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The role of military deployment experiences and PTSD in coronary heart disease (CHD) is not well defined, especially in young US service members with recent combat exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate the relationships between wartime experiences, PTSD, and CHD. Current and former US military <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">personnel</span></strong> from all service branches participating in the Millennium Cohort Study during 2001 to 2008 (n=60 025) were evaluated for newly self-reported CHD. Electronic medical record review for <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification</i> codes for CHD was conducted among a subpopulation of active duty members (n=23 794). Logistic regression models examined the associations between combat experiences and PTSD with CHD with adjustment for established CHD risk factors. A total of 627 participants (1.0%) newly reported CHD over an average of 5.6 years of follow-up. Deployers with combat experiences had an increased odds of newly reporting CHD (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.40) and having a diagnosis code for new-onset CHD (odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.84) compared with noncombat deployers. Screening positive for PTSD symptoms was associated with self-reported CHD before but not after adjustment for depression and anxiety and was not associated with a new diagnosis code for CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Combat deployments are associated with new-onset CHD among young US service members and veterans. Experiences of intense stress may increase the risk for CHD over a relatively short period among young adults.</p></sec>

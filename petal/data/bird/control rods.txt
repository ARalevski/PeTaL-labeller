Quantifying the ‘law of diminishing returns’ in magnetically controlled growing rods
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Magnetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s (MCGRs) allow non-invasive   correction of the spinal deformity in the treatment of early-onset   scoliosis. Conventional growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong> systems (CGRS) need repeated   surgical distractions: these are associated with the effect of the   ‘law of diminishing returns’.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to quantify this effect in   MCGRs over sequential distractions. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 35 patients with a maximum follow-up of 57 months   were included in the study. There were 17 boys and 18 girls with   a mean age of 7.4 years (2 to 14). True Distraction (TD) was determined   by measuring the expansion gap on fluoroscopy. This was compared   with Intended Distraction (ID) and expressed as the ‘T/I’ ratio.   The T/I ratio and the Cobb angle were calculated at several time   points during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 30 months (6 to 57). There was a significant   decrease in the mean T/I ratio over time (convex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong> at 3 months   0.81, <sc>sd</sc> 0.58 <i>vs</i> 51 months 0.17, <sc>sd </sc>0.16,    p = 0.0001; concave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong> at 3 months 0.93, <sc>sd</sc> 0.67 <i>vs</i> 51   months 0.18, <sc>sd</sc> 0.15, p = 0.0001).

Global Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Heart Failure and Preserved or Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We hypothesized that pulmonary venous hypertension in heart failure (HF) leads to predominate remodeling of pulmonary veins and that the severity of venous remodeling is associated with the severity of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with HF (n=108; 53 preserved and 55 reduced ejection fraction) with PH (HF-PH; pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] ≥40 mm Hg) were compared to normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (n=12) and patients with primary pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD; n=17). In lung specimens from autopsy (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, HF-PH, and 7 PVOD) or surgery (10 PVOD), quantitative histomorphometry was performed in all analyzable arteries (n=4949), veins (n=7630), and small indeterminate vessels (IV; n=2168) to define percent medial thickness (arteries) and percent intimal thickness (%IT) (arteries, veins, and IV) relative to external diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average arterial percent medial thickness (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 6.9; HF-PH, 11.0; PVOD, 15.0), arterial %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 4.9; HF-PH, 14.9; PVOD, 31.1), venous %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 14.0; HF-PH, 24.9; PVOD, 43.9), and IV %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 10.6; HF-PH, 25.8; PVOD, 50.0) in HF-PH were higher than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but lower than PVOD (<i>P</i>≤0.005 for all). PASP (mm Hg) was lower in HF-PH (median, 59 [interquartile range, 50–70]) than in PVOD (median, 91 [interquartile range, 82–103]). PASP correlated with arterial percent medial thickness (<i>r</i>=0.41) and arterial %IT (<i>r</i>=0.35) but more strongly with venous %IT (<i>r</i>=0.49) and IV %IT (<i>r</i>=0.55) (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all). Associations between PASP and venous or IV %IT remained significant after adjusting for arterial percent medial thickness and %IT and did not vary by HF type. In patients with right heart catheterization (30 HF-PH, 14 PVOD), similar associations between the transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular remodeling existed, with numerically stronger associations for venous and IV %IT. Although the PASP was slightly higher in patients with HF-PH with right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary vascular remodeling was not more severe. Pulmonary vascular remodeling severity was associated with reductions in the diffusing capacity of the lungs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In HF, PH is associated with global pulmonary vascular remodeling, but the severity of PH correlates most strongly with venous and small IV intimal thickening, similar to the pattern observed in PVOD. These findings expand our understanding of the pathobiology of PH in HF.</p></sec>

Hybrid molecular-colloidal liquid crystals
<p>Order and fluidity often coexist, with examples ranging from biological membranes to liquid crystals, but the symmetry of these soft-matter systems is typically higher than that of the constituent building blocks. We dispersed micrometer-long inorganic colloidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s in a nematic liquid crystalline fluid of molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s. Both types of uniaxial building blocks, while freely diffusing, interact to form an orthorhombic nematic fluid, in which like-sized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s are roughly parallel to each other and the molecular ordering direction is orthogonal to that of colloidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s. A coarse-grained model explains the experimental temperature-concentration phase diagram with one biaxial and two uniaxial nematic phases, as well as the orientational distributions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s. Displaying properties of biaxial optical crystals, these hybrid molecular-colloidal fluids can be switched by electric and magnetic fields.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average plant oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p>Drought stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced water availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in water-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to drought stress through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of stomatal aperture and water transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the drought tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by drought stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved water use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led drought-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>ucts diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> and water-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Transcatheter Interatrial Shunt Device for the Treatment of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (REDUCE LAP-HF I [Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In nonrandomized, open-label studies, a transcatheter interatrial shunt device (IASD, Corvia Medical) was associated with lower pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), fewer symptoms, and greater quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure (HF) and midrange or preserved ejection fraction (EF ≥40%).

Participants were randomized (1:1) to the IASD versus a sham procedure (femoral venous access with intracardiac echocardiography but no IASD placement). The participants and investigators assessing the participants during follow-up were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary effectiveness end point was exercise PCWP at 1 month. The primary safety end point was major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal events at 1 month.

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have a far worse prognosis than those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). In the intact heart, SSc-PAH exhibits depressed rest and reserve right ventricular (RV) contractility compared with IPAH.

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. The development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by curve fit of the diastolic pressure-volume curve. Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) was measured to quantify changes in fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (group×time <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83).

Patients with T1DM were categorized according to number of risk factors not at target: glycohemoglobin, blood pressure, albuminuria, smoking, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Modulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> signaling and ion transport by recruitment of kinases and phosphatases mediated by the regulatory protein IRBIT
<p>IRBIT is a multifunctional protein that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s the activity of various epithelial ion transporters including NBCe1-B. Interaction with IRBIT increases NBCe1-B activity and exposes two cryptic Cl<sup>−</sup>-sensing GXXXP sites that enable regulation of NBCe1-B by intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>). Here, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that IRBIT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led five phosphorylation sites in NBCe1-B that determined both the active conformation of the transporter and its regulation by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Mutational analysis suggested that the phosphorylation status of Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> was regulated by IRBIT and determined whether NBCe1 transporters are in active or inactive conformations. The absence of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, or Ser<sup>235</sup> p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>uced NBCe1-B in the conformations pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, or pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup>, respectively. The activity of the pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form was similar to that of IRBIT-activated NBCe1-B, but it was insensitive to inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. The properties of the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form were similar to those of wild-type NBCe1-B, whereas the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup> form was partially active, further activated by IRBIT, but retained inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Furthermore, IRBIT recruited the phosphatase PP1 and the kinase SPAK to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> phosphorylation of Ser<sup>65</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>32</sup>GXXXP<sup>36</sup> motif. IRBIT also recruited the phosphatase calcineurin and the kinase CaMKII to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> phosphorylation of Ser<sup>12</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>194</sup>GXXXP<sup>198</sup> motif. Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> are conserved in all NBCe1 variants and affect their activity. These findings reveal how multiple kinase and phosphatase pathways use phosphorylation sites to fine-tune a transporter, which have important implications for epithelial fluid and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> secretion.</p>

The plant cell wall integrity maintenance and immune signaling systems cooperate to control stress responses in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Cell walls surround all plant cells, and their composition and structure are modified in a tightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led, adaptive manner to meet sometimes opposing functional requirements during growth and development. The plant cell wall integrity (CWI) maintenance mechanism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s these functional modifications, as well as responses to cell wall damage (CWD). We investigated how the CWI system mediates responses to CWD in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. CWD induced by cell wall–degrading enzymes or an inhibitor of cellulose biosynthesis elicited similar, turgor-sensitive stress responses. Phenotypic clustering with 27 genotypes identified a core group of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and ion channels required for the activation of CWD responses. A genetic analysis showed that the RLK FEI2 and the plasma membrane–localized mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel MCA1 functioned downstream of the RLK THE1 in CWD perception. In contrast, pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) signaling components, including the receptors for plant elicitor peptides (<i>At</i>Peps) PEPR1 and PEPR2, repressed responses to CWD. CWD induced the expression of <i>PROPEP1</i> and <i>PROPEP3</i>, which encode the precursors of <i>At</i>Pep1 and <i>At</i>Pep3, and the release of PROPEP3 into the growth medium. Application of <i>At</i>Pep1 and <i>At</i>Pep3 repressed CWD-induced phytohormone accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that <i>At</i>Pep-mediated signaling suppresses CWD-induced defense responses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by the CWI mechanism. This suppression was alleviated when PTI signaling downstream of PEPR1 and PEPR2 was impaired. Defense responses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by the CWI maintenance mechanism might thus compensate to some extent for the loss of PTI signaling elements.</p>

The way forward for vector control

The fundamental advantages of temporal networks
<p>Most networked systems of scientific interest are characterized by temporal links, meaning the network’s structure changes over time. Link temporality has been shown to hinder many dynamical processes, from information spreading to accessibility, by disrupting network paths. Considering the ubiquity of temporal networks in nature, we ask: Are there any advantages of the networks’ temporality? We use an analytical framework to show that temporal networks can, compared to their static counterparts, reach <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>lability faster, demand orders of magnitude less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> energy, and have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> trajectories, that are considerably more compact than those characterizing static networks. Thus, temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static networks, enhancing our ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> them.</p>

PGR5-Dependent Cyclic Electron Flow Protects Photosystem I under Fluctuating Light at Donor and Acceptor Sides
<p>In response to a sudden increase in light intensity, plants must cope with absorbed excess photon energy to protect photosystems from photodamage. Under fluctuating light, PSI is severely photodamaged in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>proton gradient regulation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutant defective in the main pathway of PSI cyclic electron transport (CET). Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed regulatory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) reservation of electron sink capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>uction ratio (acceptor-side regulation) and (2) down-regulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> for slowing down the electron flow toward PSI (donor-side regulation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> backgrounds by int<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>ucing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hypersensitivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to luminal acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant background but restricted linear electron transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large electron sink and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. Thus, donor-side regulation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side regulation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side regulation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 Controls Cell Fate Transition during Stomatal Development
<p>Stomata on the plant epidermis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> gas and water exchange and are formed by MAPK-dependent processes. Although the contribution of MAP KINASE3 (MPK3) and MPK6 (MPK3/MPK6) to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of stomatal patterning and differentiation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) has been examined extensively, how they are inactivated and regulate distinct stages of stomatal development is unknown. Here, we identify a dual-specificity phosphatase, MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1), which promotes stomatal cell fate transition by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling MAPK activation at the early stage of stomatal development. Loss of function of <i>MKP1</i> creates clusters of small cells that fail to differentiate into stomata, resulting in the formation of patches of pavement cells. We show that MKP1 acts downstream of YODA (a MAPK kinase kinase) but upstream of MPK3/MPK6 in the stomatal signaling pathway and that MKP1 deficiency causes stomatal signal-induced MAPK hyperactivation in vivo. By expressing MKP1 in the three discrete cell types of stomatal lineage, we further identified that MKP1-mediated deactivation of MAPKs in early stomatal precursor cells directs cell fate transition leading to stomatal differentiation. Together, our data reveal the important role of MKP1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling MAPK signaling specificity and cell fate decision during stomatal development.</p>

Tissue-Specific Control of the Endocycle by the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome Inhibitors UVI4 and DEL1<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The endocycle represents a modified mitotic cell cycle that in plants is often coupled to cell enlargement and differentiation. Endocycle onset is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by activity of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting cell-cycle factors for destruction. CELL CYCLE SWITCH52 (CCS52) proteins represent rate-limiting activator subunits of the APC/C. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), mutations in either <i>CCS52A1</i> or <i>CCS52A2</i> activators result in a delayed endocycle onset, whereas their overexpression triggers increased DNA ploidy levels. Here, the relative contribution of the APC/C<sup>CCS52A1</sup> and APC/C<sup>CCS52A2</sup> complexes to different developmental processes was studied through analysis of their negative regulators, being the ULTRAVIOLET-B-INSENSITIVE4 protein and the DP-E2F-Like1 transcriptional repressor, respectively. Our data illustrate cooperative activity of the APC/C<sup>CCS52A1</sup> and APC/C<sup>CCS52A2</sup> complexes during root and trichome development, but functional interdependency during leaf development. Furthermore, we found APC/C<sup>CCS52A1</sup> activity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> <i>CCS52A2</i> expression.

Transcription Factor Interplay between LEAFY and APETALA1/CAULIFLOWER during Floral Initiation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transcription factors LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1), together with the AP1 paralog CAULIFLOWER (CAL), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the onset of flower development in a partially redundant manner. This redundancy is thought to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of a shared set of target genes. However, whether these genes are independently or cooperatively regulated by LFY and AP1/CAL is currently unknown. To better understand the regulatory relationship between LFY and AP1/CAL and to obtain deeper insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of floral initiation, we monitored the activity of LFY in the absence of AP1/CAL function. We found that the regulation of several known LFY target genes is unaffected by AP1/CAL perturbation, while others appear to require AP1/CAL activity. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that LFY and AP1/CAL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the expression of some genes in an antagonistic manner. Notably, these include key regulators of floral initiation such as <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>), which had been previously reported to be directly repressed by both LFY and AP1. We show here that <i>TFL1</i> expression is suppressed by AP1 but promoted by LFY. We further demonstrate that LFY has an inhibitory effect on flower formation in the absence of AP1/CAL activity. We propose that LFY and AP1/CAL act as part of an incoherent feed-forward loop, a network motif where two interconnected pathways or transcription factors act in opposite directions on a target gene, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the establishment of a stable developmental program for the formation of flowers.</p>

Genome Wide Analysis of Fatty Acid Desaturation and Its Response to Temperature
<p>Plants modify the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of their membrane and storage lipids in order to adapt to changes in temperature. In developing seeds, this response is largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by the activities of the microsomal ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acid desaturases, FAD2 and FAD3. Although temperature regulation of desaturation has been studied at the molecular and biochemical levels, the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of this trait is poorly understood. Here, we have characterized the response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed lipids to variation in ambient temperature and found that heat inhibits both ω-6 and ω-3 desaturation in phosphatidylcholine, leading to a proportional change in triacylglycerol composition. Analysis of the 19 parental accessions of the multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population showed that significant natural variation exists in the temperature responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation. A combination of quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using the MAGIC population suggests that ω-6 desaturation is largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by cis-acting sequence variants in the <i>FAD2</i> 5′ untranslated region intron that determine the expression level of the gene. However, the temperature responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by a separate QTL on chromosome 2. The identity of this locus is unknown, but genome-wide association studies identified potentially causal sequence variants within ∼40 genes in an ∼450-kb region of the QTL.</p>

Genetic Architecture of Flowering-Time Variation in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transition to rep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>uctive development is a crucial step in the plant life cycle, and the timing of this transition is an important factor in crop yields. Here, we report new insights into the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of natural variation in flowering time in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a nondomesticated pooid grass closely related to cereals such as wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the rapid-flowering accession Bd21 and the delayed-flowering accession Bd1-1 were grown in a variety of environmental conditions to enable exploration of the genetic architecture of flowering time. A genotyping-by-sequencing approach was used to develop SNP markers for genetic map construction, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> differences in flowering time were identified. Many of the flowering-time QTLs are detected across a range of photoperiod and vernalization conditions, suggesting that the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of flowering within this population is robust. The two major QTLs identified in undomesticated <i>B. distachyon</i> colocalize with <i>VERNALIZATION1/PHYTOCHROME C</i> and <i>VERNALIZATION2</i>, loci identified as flowering regulators in the domesticated crops wheat and barley. This suggests that variation in flowering time is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led in part by a set of genes broadly conserved within pooid grasses.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Molecular Evolution of the Yap/Yorkie Proto-Oncogene and Elucidation of Its Core Transcriptional Program
<p>Throughout Metazoa, developmental processes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by a surprisingly limited number of conserved signaling pathways. Precisely how these signaling cassettes were assembled in early animal evolution remains poorly understood, as do the molecular transitions that potentiated the acquisition of their myriad developmental functions. Here we analyze the molecular evolution of the proto-oncogene yes-associated protein (Yap)/Yorkie, a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s organ size in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals. Based on heterologous functional analysis of evolutionarily distant Yap/Yorkie orthologs, we demonstrate that a structurally distinct interaction interface between Yap/Yorkie and its partner TEAD/Scalloped became fixed in the eumetazoan common ancestor. We then combine transcriptional profiling of tissues expressing phylogenetically diverse forms of Yap/Yorkie with ChIP-seq validation to identify a common downstream gene expression program underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of tissue growth in <i>Drosophila</i>. Intriguingly, a subset of the newly identified Yorkie target genes are also induced by Yap in mammalian tissues, thus revealing a conserved Yap-dependent gene expression signature likely to mediate organ size <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> throughout bilaterian animals. Combined, these experiments provide new mechanistic insights while revealing the ancient evolutionary history of Hippo signaling.</p>

Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (<i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>)
<p>Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical abilities are widespread among vertebrates. While experiments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in <i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia desert. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led for non-numerical continuous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led for continuous quantities and half not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led for continuous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led for continuous quantities proved able to learn the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish tested with visual stimuli.</p>

A long-term follow-up study of the clinical and radiographic outcome of distal trochanteric transfer in Legg-Calvé-Perthes’ disease following varus derotational osteotomy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To assess the long-term effect of distal trochanteric transfer   (DTT) on the clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients with   Legg-Calvé-Perthes’ disease (LCPD) following a varus derotational   osteotomy (VDRO).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>For this single centre cross-sectional retrospective study we   analysed the data of 22 patients (24 hips) with LCPD who had greater   trochanteric overgrowth (GTO), following a VDRO performed in our   institution between 1959 and 1983. GTO was defined as an articular   trochanteric distance (ATD) of < 5 mm. We compared the radiographic   and clinical outcomes of patients who underwent DTT for GTO (ten   patients, ten hips) with those who did not (12 patients, 14 hips).   Age at presentation was 6.9 years (4 to 10) and 8.0 years (3.2 to   12) respectively.

Mediterranean Diet Improves High-Density Lipoprotein Function in High-Cardiovascular-Risk Individuals
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The biological functions of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) contribute to explaining the cardioprotective role of the lipoprotein beyond quantitative HDL cholesterol levels.

However, to date, no long-term, large-scale, randomized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial has been conducted to assess the effects of an antioxidant-rich dietary pattern (such as a traditional Mediterranean diet [TMD]) on HDL function in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was performed in a random subsample of volunteers from the PREDIMED Study (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea; n=296) after a 1-year intervention.

We assessed the effects of both TMDs on the role of HDL particles on reverse cholesterol transport (cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL ability to esterify cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity), HDL antioxidant properties (paraoxonase-1 arylesterase activity and total HDL antioxidant capacity on low-density lipoproteins), and HDL vasodilatory capacity (HDL ability to induce the release of nitric oxide in endothelial cells).

Patients With Long-QT Syndrome Caused by Impaired <i>hERG</i>-Encoded K<sub>v</sub>11.1 Potassium Channel Have Exaggerated Endocrine Pancreatic and Incretin Function Associated With Reactive Hypoglycemia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Loss-of-function mutations in <i>hERG</i> (encoding the K<sub>v</sub>11.1 voltage-gated potassium channel) cause long-QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) because of prolonged cardiac repolarization. However, K<sub>v</sub>11.1 is also present in pancreatic α and β cells and intestinal L and K cells, secreting glucagon, insulin, and the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide), respectively. These hormones are crucial for glucose regulation, and long-QT syndrome may cause disturbed glucose regulation. We measured secretion of these hormones and cardiac repolarization in response to glucose ingestion in LQT2 patients with functional mutations in <i>hERG</i> and matched healthy participants, testing the hypothesis that LQT2 patients have increased incretin and β-cell function and decreased α-cell function, and thus lower glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Eleven patients with LQT2 and 22 sex-, age-, and body mass index–matched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> participants underwent a 6-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with ECG recording and blood sampling for measurements of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In comparison with matched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> participants, LQT2 patients had 56% to 78% increased serum insulin, serum C-peptide, plasma GLP-1, and plasma GIP responses (<i>P</i>=0.03–0.001) and decreased plasma glucose levels after glucose ingestion (<i>P</i>=0.02) with more symptoms of hypoglycemia (<i>P</i>=0.04). Sixty-three percent of LQT2 patients developed hypoglycemic plasma glucose levels (<70 mg/dL) versus 36% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> participants (<i>P</i>=0.16), and 18% patients developed serious hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) versus none of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s.

Closing the Gap in Hypertension Control Between Younger and Older Adults
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Joint National Committee goal blood pressure for all adults was <140/<90 mm Hg or lower from 1984 to 2013. Adults aged ≥60 years (older) have mainly isolated systolic hypertension, with major trials attaining systolic blood pressure <150 but not <140 mm Hg. The main objective was to assess changes in hypertension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> to <140/<90 mm Hg in younger (aged <60 years) and older adults and <150/<90 mm Hg in the latter.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 1988 to 1994, 1999 to 2004, and 2005 to 2010 were analyzed in adults aged ≥18 years. From 1988 to 1994 to 2005 to 2010, hypertension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> to <140/<90 mm Hg improved in older (31.6% to 53.1%; <i>P</i><0.001) and younger (45.7% to 55.9%; <i>P</i><0.001) patients. The age gap in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> declined from 14.1% (<i>P</i><0.01) in 1988 to 1994 to 2.8% (<i>P</i>=0.13) in 2005 to 2010.

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

Reduction of blood oxygen levels enhances postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in Burmese python (<i>Python bivittatus</i>)
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by reversible enlargement of cardiomyocytes and changes in chamber architecture, which increase stroke volume and [Formula] via augmented convective oxygen transport. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to occur in response to repeated elevations of O<sub>2</sub> demand and/or reduced O<sub>2</sub> supply in several species of vertebrate ectotherms, including postprandial Burmese pythons (<i>Python bivittatus</i>). Recent data suggest postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in <i>P. bivittatus</i> is a facultative rather than obligatory response to digestion, though the triggers of this response are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that an O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch stimulates postprandial cardiac enlargement in Burmese pythons. To test this hypothesis, we rendered animals anemic prior to feeding, essentially halving blood oxygen content during the postprandial period. Fed anemic animals had heart rates 126% higher than those of fasted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s, which, coupled with a 71% increase in mean arterial pressure, suggests fed anemic animals were experiencing significantly elevated cardiac work. We found significant cardiac hypertrophy in fed anemic animals, which exhibited ventricles 39% larger than those of fasted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s and 28% larger than in fed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s. These findings support our hypothesis that those animals with a greater magnitude of O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch exhibit the largest hearts. The ‘low O<sub>2</sub> signal’ stimulating postprandial cardiac hypertrophy is likely mediated by elevated ventricular wall stress associated with postprandial hemodynamics.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hyd<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>ynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hyd<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>ynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hyd<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>ynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hyd<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>ynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

Dislocation of a primary total hip arthroplasty is more common in patients with a lumbar spinal fusion
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Lumbar fusion is known to reduce the variation in pelvic tilt   between standing and sitting. A flexible lumbo-pelvic unit increases   the stability of total hip arthroplasty (THA) when seated by increasing   anterior clearance and acetabular anteversion, thereby preventing   impingement of the prosthesis. Lumbar fusion may eliminate this protective   pelvic movement. The effect of lumbar fusion on the stability of   total hip arthroplasty has not previously been investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The Medicare database was searched for patients who had undergone   THA and spinal fusion between 2005 and 2012. PearlDiver software   was used to query the database by the International Classification   of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedural   code for primary THA and lumbar spinal fusion. Patients who had   undergone both lumbar fusion and THA were then divided into three   groups: 1 to 2 levels, 3 to 7 levels and 8+ levels of fusion. The   rate of dislocation in each group was established using ICD-9-CM codes.   Patients who underwent THA without spinal fusion were used as a   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group. Statistical significant difference between groups   was tested using the chi-squared test, and significance set at p   < 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At one-year follow-up, 14 747 patients were found to have had   a THA after lumbar spinal fusion (12 079 1 to 2 levels, 2594 3 to   7 levels, 74 8+ levels). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group consisted of 839 004   patients. The dislocation rate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group was 1.55%. A   higher rate of dislocation was found in patients with a spinal fusion   of 1 to 2 levels (2.96%, p < 0.0001) and 3 to 7 levels (4.12%,   p < 0.0001). Patients with 3 to 7 levels of fusion had a higher   rate of dislocation than patients with 1 to 2 levels of fusion (odds   ratio (OR) = 1.60, p < 0.0001). When groups were matched for   age and gender to the unfused cohort, patients with 1 to 2 levels   of fusion had an OR of 1.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to   2.32, p < 0.001), and those with 3 to 7 levels of fusion an OR   of 2.77 (CI 2.04 to 4.80, p < 0.001) for dislocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with a previous history of lumbar spinal fusion have   a significantly higher rate of dislocation of their THA than age-   and gender-matched patients without a lumbar spinal fusion.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:585–91.</p></sec>

Staged lengthening and reconstruction for children with a leg-length discrepancy after excision of an osteosarcoma around the knee
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Children treated for osteosarcoma around the knee often have   a substantial leg-length discrepancy at skeletal maturity. The aim   of this study was to investigate the results of staged skeletal   reconstruction after a leg lengthening procedure using an external   fixator in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 11 patients who underwent staged reconstruction with   either an arthroplasty (n = 6) or an arth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>esis (n = 5).

Risk of early mortality after cemented compared with cementless total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It has been suggested that cemented fixation of total hip arthroplasty   (THA) is associated with an increased peri-operative mortality compared   with cementless THA. Our aim was to investigate this through a nationwide   matched cohort study adjusting for age, comorbidity, and socioeconomic   background.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 178 784 patients with osteoarthritis who underwent   either cemented or cementless THA from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty   Register were matched with 862 294 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s from the general population.   Information about the causes of death, comorbidities, and socioeconomic   background was obtained. Mortality within the first 90 days after   the operation was the primary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients who underwent cemented THA had an increased risk of   death during the first 14 days compared with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (hazard   ratio (HR) 1.3, confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 1.44), corresponding   to an absolute increase in risk of five deaths per 10 000 observations.   No such early increase of risk was seen in those who underwent cementless THA.   Between days 15 and 29 the risk of mortality was decreased for those   with cemented THA (HR 0.7, CI 0.62 to 0.87). Between days 30 and   90 all patients undergoing THA, irrespective of the mode of fixation,   had a lower risk of death than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s. Patients selected for cementless   fixation were younger, healthier and had a higher level of education   and income than those selected for cemented THA. A supplementary   analysis of 16 556 hybrid THAs indicated that cementation of the   femoral component was associated with a slight increase in mortality   up to 15 days, whereas no such increase in mortality was seen in   those with a cemented acetabular component combined with a cementless   femoral component.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This nationwide matched cohort study indicates that patients   receiving cemented THA have a minimally increased relative risk   of early mortality that is reversed from day 15 and thereafter.   The absolute increase in risk is very small.

Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a standard length intramedullary cemented stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical plates have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the survivorship   of short-stemmed endoprostheses and extra-cortical plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 37 patients who underwent limb salvage surgery   for a primary neoplasm of bone between 1998 and 2013. Endoprosthetic   replacement involved the proximal humerus in nine, the proximal   femur in nine, the distal femur in 13 and the proximal tibia in   six patients. There were 12 primary (32%) and 25 revision procedures (68%).   Implant survivorship was compared with matched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s.

The mean length   of the stem was 33 mm (20 to 60) in the humerus and 79 mm (34 to   100) in the lower limb. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of the   implant according to anatomical site confirmed that there was no   statistically significant difference between the short-stemmed endoprostheses and   the standard stemmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s at the proximal humeral (p = 0.84),   proximal femoral (p = 0.57), distal femoral (p = 0.21) and proximal   tibial (p = 0.61) sites.</p><p>In the short-stemmed group, no implants with extra-cortical plate   osseointegration suffered loosening at a mean of 8.5 years (range   2 to 16 years).

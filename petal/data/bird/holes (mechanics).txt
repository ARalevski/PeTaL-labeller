A loud quasi-periodic oscillation after a star is disrupted by a massive black hole
<p>The tidal forces close to massive black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s can rip apart stars that come too close to them. As the resulting stellar debris spirals toward the black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>, the debris heats up and emits x-rays. We report observations of a stable 131-second x-ray quasi-periodic oscillation from the tidal disruption event ASASSN-14li. Assuming the black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> mass indicated by host galaxy scaling relations, these observations imply that the periodicity originates from close to the event horizon and that the black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> is rapidly spinning. Our findings demonstrate that tidal disruption events can generate quasi-periodic oscillations that encode information about the physical properties of their black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s.</p>

Supersonic gas streams enhance the formation of massive black holes in the early universe
<p>The origin of super-massive black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s in the early universe remains poorly understood. Gravitational collapse of a massive primordial gas cloud is a promising initial process, but theoretical studies have difficulty growing the black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> fast enough. We report numerical simulations of early black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> formation starting from realistic cosmological conditions. Supersonic gas motions left over from the Big Bang prevent early gas cloud formation until rapid gas condensation is triggered in a protogalactic halo. A protostar is formed in the dense, turbulent gas cloud, and it grows by sporadic mass accretion until it acquires 34,000 solar masses. The massive star ends its life with a catastrophic collapse to leave a black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>—a promising seed for the formation of a monstrous black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>.</p>

Holographic description of a quantum black hole on a computer
<p>Black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s have been predicted to radiate particles and eventually evaporate, which has led to the information loss paradox and implies that the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics may be violated. Superstring theory, a consistent theory of quantum gravity, provides a possible solution to the paradox if evaporating black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s can actually be described in terms of standard quantum mechanical systems, as conjectured from the theory. Here, we test this conjecture by calculating the mass of a black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> in the corresponding quantum mechanical system numerically. Our results agree well with the prediction from gravity theory, including the leading quantum gravity correction. Our ability to simulate black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s offers the potential to further explore the yet mysterious nature of quantum gravity through well-established quantum mechanics.</p>

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

Photon-mediated interactions between quantum emitters in a diamond nanocavity
<p>Photon-mediated interactions between quantum systems are essential for realizing quantum networks and scalable quantum information processing. We demonstrate such interactions between pairs of silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers coupled to a diamond nanophotonic cavity. When the optical transitions of the two color centers are tuned into resonance, the coupling to the common cavity mode results in a coherent interaction between them, leading to spectrally resolved superradiant and subradiant states. We use the electronic spin degrees of freedom of the SiV centers to control these optically mediated interactions. Such controlled interactions will be crucial in developing cavity-mediated quantum gates between spin qubits and for realizing scalable quantum network nodes.</p>

Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single atoms cooperatively emit photons. Demonstration of controlled collective atom-field interactions has resulted from the ability to directly imprint correlations with an atomic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-atom superradiance: Single atoms with predefined correlation traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> atoms that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of atoms). Enhanced collective photoemission of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity atom number was less than unity. The correlation among single atoms was achieved by nanometer-precision position control and phase-aligned state manipulation of atoms by using a nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>-array aperture. Our results demonstrate a platform for phase-controlled atom-field interactions.</p>

A precise measurement of the magnetic field in the corona of the black hole binary V404 Cygni
<p>Observations of binary stars containing an accreting black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> or neutron star often show x-ray emission extending to high energies (>10 kilo­–electron volts), which is ascribed to an accretion disk corona of energetic particles akin to those seen in the solar corona.

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The structure reveals two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es on the intracellular side and two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es. Separate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T structure reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base’s interactions.</p>

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

Increase in predator-prey size ratios throughout the Phanerozoic history of marine ecosystems
<p>The escalation hypothesis posits that predation by increasingly powerful and metabolically active carnivores has been a major driver of metazoan evolution. We test a key tenet of this hypothesis by analyzing predatory drill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s in fossil marine shells, which provide a ~500-million-year record of individual predator-prey interactions. We show that drill-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> size is a robust predictor of body size among modern drilling predators and that drill-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> size (and thus inferred predator size and power) rose substantially from the Ordovician to the Quaternary period, whereas the size of drilled prey remained stable. Together, these trends indicate a directional increase in predator-prey size ratios. We hypothesize that increasing predator-prey size ratios reflect increases in prey abundance, prey nutrient content, and predation among predators.</p>

Principles for designing proteins with cavities formed by curved β sheets

Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling β-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of β sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to design, de novo, a series of proteins with curved β sheets topped with α helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that β-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the design of proteins with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es and provides a route to custom design ligand-binding and catalytic sites.</p>

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>ation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

Voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into smooth muscle during contraction promotes endothelium-mediated feedback vasodilation in arterioles
<p>Vascular smooth muscle contraction is suppressed by feedback dilation mediated by the endothelium. In skeletal muscle arterioles, this feedback can be activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals passing from smooth muscle through gap junctions to endothelial cells, which protrude through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s in the internal elastic lamina to make contact with vascular smooth muscle cells. Although hypothetically either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) may provide the intercellular signal, it is generally thought that IP<sub>3</sub> diffusion is responsible. We provide evidence that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCCs) in vascular smooth muscle can pass to the endothelium through positions aligned with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s in the internal elastic lamina in amounts sufficient to activate endothelial cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. In endothelial cells in which IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs) were blocked, VDCC-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were transient and localized to the endothelium that protrudes through the internal elastic lamina to contact vascular smooth muscle cells. In endothelial cells in which IP<sub>3</sub>Rs were not blocked, VDCC-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in endothelial cells were amplified to form propagating waves. These waves activated voltage-insensitive, intermediate-conductance, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (IK<sub>Ca</sub>) channels, thereby providing feedback that effectively suppressed vasoconstriction and enabled cycles of constriction and dilation called vasomotion. Thus, agonists that stimulate vascular smooth muscle depolarization provide Ca<sup>2+</sup> to endothelial cells to activate a feedback circuit that protects tissue blood flow.</p>

Counter-propagating charge transport in the quantum Hall effect regime
<p>The quantum Hall effect, observed in a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field, imposes a 1D-like chiral, downstream, transport of charge carriers along the sample edges. Although this picture remains valid for electrons and Laughlin’s fractional quasiparticles, it no longer holds for quasiparticles in the so-called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>-conjugate states. These states are expected, when disorder and interactions are weak, to harbor upstream charge modes. However, so far, charge currents were observed to flow exclusively downstream in the quantum Hall regime. Studying the canonical spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized <i>v</i> = 2/3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>-like states in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures, we observed a significant upstream charge current at short propagation distances in the spin unpolarized state.</p>

The multiple merger assembly of a hyperluminous obscured quasar at redshift 4.6

Far-infrared dust continuum observations show three galaxy companions around W2246−0526 with disturbed morphologies, connected by streams of dust likely produced by the dynamical interaction.

Suppressing spatiotemporal lasing instabilities with wave-chaotic microcavities
<p>Spatiotemporal instabilities are widespread phenomena resulting from complexity and nonlinearity. In broad-area edge-emitting semiconductor lasers, the nonlinear interactions of multiple spatial modes with the active medium can result in filamentation and spatiotemporal chaos.

We demonstrate a powerful approach to suppress spatiotemporal instabilities using wave-chaotic or disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es. The interference of many propagating waves with random phases in such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es disrupts the formation of self-organized structures such as filaments, resulting in stable lasing dynamics. Our method provides a general and robust scheme to prevent the formation and growth of nonlinear instabilities for a large variety of high-power lasers.</p>

Fatty acyl recognition and transfer by an integral membrane <i>S</i>-acyltransferase

We present crystal structures of two DHHC palmitoyltransferases and a covalent intermediate mimic. The active site resides at the membrane-cytosol interface, which allows the enzyme to catalyze thioester-exchange chemistry by using fatty acyl–coenzyme A and explains why membrane-proximal cysteines are candidates for palmitoylation. The acyl chain binds in a cavity formed by the transmembrane domain. We propose a mechanism for acyl chain–length selectivity in DHHC enzymes on the basis of cavity mutants with preferences for shorter and longer acyl chains.</p>

We demonstrate PSCs that achieve stabilized efficiencies exceeding 20% with copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> extraction layer. A fast solvent removal method enabled the creation of compact, highly conformal CuSCN layers that facilitate rapid carrier extraction and collection. The PSCs showed high thermal stability under long-term heating, although their operational stability was poor. This instability originated from potential-induced degradation of the CuSCN/Au contact. The addition of a conductive reduced graphene oxide spacer layer between CuSCN and gold allowed PSCs to retain >95% of their initial efficiency after aging at a maximum power point for 1000 hours under full solar intensity at 60°C. Under both continuous full-sun illumination and thermal stress, CuSCN-based devices surpassed the stability of spiro-OMeTAD–based PSCs.</p>

Real-time spectral interferometry probes the internal dynamics of femtosecond soliton molecules

By means of an emerging time-stretch technique, we resolve the evolution of femtosecond soliton molecules in the cavity of a few-cycle mode-locked laser. We track two- and three-soliton bound states over hundreds of thousands of consecutive cavity roundtrips, identifying fixed points and periodic and aperiodic molecular orbits. A class of trajectories acquires a path-dependent geometrical phase, implying that its dynamics may be topologically protected. These findings highlight the importance of real-time detection in resolving interactions in complex nonlinear systems, including the dynamics of soliton bound states, breathers, and rogue waves.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6
<p>Dirigent proteins impart stereoselectivity to phenoxy radical coupling reactions in plants and, thus, play an essential role in the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products. This includes the regioselective and enantioselective coupling and subsequent cyclization of two coniferyl alcohol radicals to pinoresinol as the committed step of lignan biosynthesis. The reaction is controlled by dirigent proteins, which, depending on the species and protein, direct the reaction to either (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol. We present the crystal structure of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å resolution. The structure shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-separated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es for substrate binding. The binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The structure supports a model in which two substrate radicals bind to each of the DIR monomers. With the aromatic rings fixed in the two pockets, the propionyl side chains face each other for radical-radical coupling, and stereoselectivity is determined by the exact positioning of the side chains. Extensive mutational analysis supports a previously unrecognized function for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclization of the bis-quinone methide reaction intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

The role of the olfactory recess in olfactory airflow
<p>The olfactory recess – a blind pocket at the back of the nasal airway – is thought to play an important role in mammalian olfaction by sequestering air outside of the main airstream, thus giving odorants time to re-circulate. Several studies have shown that species with large olfactory recesses tend to have a well-developed sense of smell. However, no study has investigated how the size of the olfactory recess relates to air circulation near the olfactory epithelium. Here we used a computer model of the nasal cavity from a bat (<i>Carollia perspicillata</i>) to test the hypothesis that a larger olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow. We predicted that during inhalation, models with an enlarged olfactory recess would have slower rates of flow through the olfactory region (i.e. the olfactory recess plus airspace around the olfactory epithelium), while during exhalation these models would have little to no flow through the olfactory recess. To test these predictions, we experimentally modified the size of the olfactory recess while holding the rest of the morphology constant. During inhalation, we found that an enlarged olfactory recess resulted in lower rates of flow in the olfactory region. Upon exhalation, air flowed through the olfactory recess at a lower rate in the model with an enlarged olfactory recess. Taken together, these results indicate that an enlarged olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow during both inhalation and exhalation. These findings add to our growing understanding of how the morphology of the nasal cavity may relate to function in this understudied region of the skull.</p>

The distribution of heat in bone during radiofrequency ablation of an <i>ex vivo</i> bovine model of osteoid osteoma
<p>Osteoid osteoma is treated primarily by radiofrequency   (RF) ablation. However, there is little information about the distribution   of heat in bone during the procedure and its safety. We constructed   a model of osteoid osteoma to assess the distribution of heat in   bone and to define the margins of safety for ablation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es   were drilled in cadaver bovine bones and filled with a liver homogenate   to simulate the tumour matrix. Temperature-sensing probes were placed   in the bone in a radial fashion away from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es. RF ablation   was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med 107 times in tumours < 10 mm in diameter (72 of   which were in cortical bone, 35 in cancellous bone), and 41 times   in cortical bone with models > 10 mm in diameter. Significantly   higher temperatures were found in cancellous bone than in cortical   bone (p < 0.05). For lesions up to 10 mm in diameter, in both   bone types, the temperature varied directly with the size of the   tumour (p < 0.05), and inversely with the distance from it. Tumours   of > 10 mm in diameter showed a trend similar to those of smaller   lesions. No temperature rise was seen beyond 12 mm from the edge   of a cortical tumour of any size. Formulae were developed to predict   the expected temperature in the bone during ablation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:677–83</p>

Tunable excitons in bilayer graphene
<p>Excitons, the bound states of an electron and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong> in a solid material, play a key role in the optical properties of insulators and semiconductors. Here, we report the observation of excitons in bilayer graphene (BLG) using photocurrent spectroscopy of high-quality BLG encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. We observed two prominent excitonic resonances with narrow line widths that are tunable from the mid-infrared to the terahertz range. These excitons obey optical selection rules distinct from those in conventional semiconductors and feature an electron pseudospin winding number of 2. An external magnetic field induces a large splitting of the valley excitons, corresponding to a <i>g</i>-factor of about 20. These findings open up opportunities to explore exciton physics with pseudospin texture in electrically tunable graphene systems.</p>

A glycerophospholipid-specific pocket in the RVFV class II fusion protein drives target membrane insertion
<p>The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, causing severe disease in humans and livestock across Africa. We determined the x-ray structure of the RVFV class II fusion protein Gc in its postfusion form and in complex with a glycerophospholipid (GPL) bound in a conserved cavity next to the fusion loop. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations further revealed a built-in motif allowing en bloc insertion of the fusion loop into membranes, making few nonpolar side-chain interactions with the aliphatic moiety and multiple polar interactions with lipid head groups upon membrane restructuring. The GPL head-group recognition pocket is conserved in the fusion proteins of other arthropod-borne viruses, such as Zika and chikungunya viruses, which have recently caused major epidemics worldwide.</p>

Ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the intestine drives T<sub>H</sub>1 cell induction and inflammation
<p>Intestinal colonization by bacteria of oral origin has been correlated with several negative health outcomes, including inflammatory bowel disease. However, a causal role of oral bacteria ectopically colonizing the intestine remains unclear. Using gnotobiotic techniques, we show that strains of <i>Klebsiella</i> spp. isolated from the salivary microbiota are strong inducers of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) cells when they colonize in the gut. These <i>Klebsiella</i> strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics, tend to colonize when the intestinal microbiota is dysbiotic, and elicit a severe gut inflammation in the context of a genetically susceptible host. Our findings suggest that the oral cavity may serve as a reservoir for potential intestinal pathobionts that can exacerbate intestinal disease.</p>

Nanophotonic rare-earth quantum memory with optically controlled retrieval
<p>Optical quantum memories are essential elements in quantum networks for long-distance distribution of quantum entanglement. Scalable development of quantum network nodes requires on-chip qubit storage functionality with control of the readout time. We demonstrate a high-fidelity nanophotonic quantum memory based on a mesoscopic neodymium ensemble coupled to a photonic crystal cavity. The nanocavity enables >95% spin polarization for efficient initialization of the atomic frequency comb memory and time bin–selective readout through an enhanced optical Stark shift of the comb frequencies. Our solid-state memory is integrable with other chip-scale photon source and detector devices for multiplexed quantum and classical information processing at the network nodes.</p>

Fabrication of fillable microparticles and other complex 3D microstructures
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) microstructures created by microfabrication and additive manufacturing have demonstrated value across a number of fields, ranging from biomedicine to microelectronics. However, the techniques used to create these devices each have their own characteristic set of advantages and limitations with regards to resolution, material compatibility, and geometrical constraints that determine the types of microstructures that can be formed. We describe a microfabrication method, termed StampEd Assembly of polymer Layers (SEAL), and create injectable pulsatile drug-delivery microparticles, pH sensors, and 3D microfluidic devices that we could not produce using traditional 3D printing. SEAL allows us to generate microstructures with complex geometry at high resolution, produce fully enclosed internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es containing a solid or liquid, and use potentially any thermoplastic material without processing additives.</p>

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators
<p>Topological phases, like the Haldane phase in spin-1 chains, defy characterization through local order parameters. Instead, nonlocal string order parameters can be employed to reveal their hidden order. Similar diluted magnetic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of spin-charge separation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden magnetic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of nonlocal spin-density correlation functions reveals a hidden finite-range antiferromagnetic order, a direct consequence of spin-charge separation. Our technique, which measures nonlocal order directly, can be readily extended to higher dimensions to study the complex interplay between magnetic order and density fluctuations.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>mance.</p>

Local amplifiers of IL-4Rα–mediated macrophage activation promote repair in lung and liver
<p>The type 2 immune response controls helminth infection and maintains tissue homeostasis but can lead to allergy and fibrosis if not adequately regulated. We have discovered local tissue-specific amplifiers of type 2–mediated macrophage activation. In the lung, surfactant protein A (SP-A) enhanced interleukin-4 (IL-4)–dependent macrophage proliferation and activation, accelerating parasite clearance and reducing pulmonary injury after infection with a lung-migrating helminth. In the peritoneal cavity and liver, C1q enhancement of type 2 macrophage activation was required for liver repair after bacterial infection, but resulted in fibrosis after peritoneal dialysis. IL-4 drives production of these structurally related defense collagens, SP-A and C1q, and the expression of their receptor, myosin 18A. These findings reveal the existence within different tissues of an amplification system needed for local type 2 responses.</p>

Bottom-up construction of a superstructure in a porous uranium-organic crystal
<p>Bottom-up construction of highly intricate structures from simple building blocks remains one of the most difficult challenges in chemistry.

The structure comprises 10 uranium nodes and seven tricarboxylate ligands (both crystallographically nonequivalent), resulting in a 173.3-angstrom cubic unit cell enclosing 816 uranium nodes and 816 organic linkers—the largest unit cell found to date for any nonbiological material. The cuboctahedra organize into pentagonal and hexagonal prismatic secondary structures, which then form tetrahedral and diamond quaternary topologies with unprecedented complexity. This packing results in the formation of colossal icosidodecahedral and rectified hexakaidecahedral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es with internal diameters of 5.0 nanometers and 6.2 nanometers, respectively—ultimately giving rise to the lowest-density MOF reported to date.</p>

“Ab initio” synthesis of zeolites for preestablished catalytic reactions

In these zeolites, the pores and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es could be generated approaching a molecular-recognition pattern. For disproportionation of toluene and isomerization of ethylbenzene into xylenes, the TSs are larger than the reaction products.

For the case of a product and TS of similar size, we synthesized a catalyst, MIT-1, for the isomerization of <i>endo</i>-dicyclopentane into adamantane.</p>

An accreting pulsar with extreme properties drives an ultraluminous x-ray source in NGC 5907

ULXs are usually modeled as stellar-mass black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hole</span></strong>s (BHs) accreting at very high rates or intermediate-mass BHs. We present observations showing that NGC 5907 ULX is instead an x-ray accreting neutron star (NS) with a spin period evolving from 1.43 seconds in 2003 to 1.13 seconds in 2014. It has an isotropic peak luminosity of [Formula]1000 times the Eddington limit for a NS at 17.1 megaparsec. Standard accretion models fail to explain its luminosity, even assuming beamed emission, but a strong multipolar magnetic field can describe its properties. These findings suggest that other extreme ULXs (x-ray luminosity [Formula] 10<sup>41 </sup>erg second[Formula]) might harbor NSs.</p>

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p>Ice formation on aerosol particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level. This is partly because the nature of active sites, local surface features where ice growth commences, is still unclear. Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) surface planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) surface, exposed at surface defects such as steps, cracks, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es, are thought to be responsible for the high ice nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar particles.</p>

Asymmetric synthesis of batrachotoxin: Enantiomeric toxins show functional divergence against Na<sub>V</sub>

Electrophysiological characterization of these molecules against Na<sub>V</sub> subtypes establishes the non-natural toxin enantiomer as a reversible antagonist of channel function, markedly different in activity from (−)-batrachotoxin. Protein mutagenesis experiments implicate a shared binding side for the enantiomers in the inner pore cavity of Na<sub>V</sub>. These findings motivate and enable subsequent studies aimed at revealing how small molecules that target the channel inner pore modulate Na<sub>V</sub> dynamics.</p>

Single-molecule optomechanics in “picocavities”
<p>Trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffraction limit and can confine light to volumes typically on the order of 30 cubic nanometers.

Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The porosity of wood cell walls is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood materials perspective. The movement of water in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous networks formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and open conduits created by vessels and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>ation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, water can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and fiber cell walls; however, these micropore networks are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the distribution of micropores in the secondary walls and middle lamellae of tracheids and fibers in relation to cell wall composition. Using two different types of probe, we identified a greater porosity of secondary cell walls and a reduced porosity of the middle lamella. Areas of reduced porosity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell wall of both tracheids and fibers that appear unrelated to lignification or the distribution of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood fiber cell walls were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to porosity probes. Vessel cell walls were comparable to those of fibers in terms of both porosity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell wall porosity in xylem. The highly lignified middle lamella, and lumen surface, act as a barrier to probe movement and, therefore, water movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

Hornwort Stomata: Architecture and Fate Shared with 400-Million-Year-Old Fossil Plants without Leaves
<p>As one of the earliest plant groups to evolve stomata, hornworts are key to understanding the origin and function of stomata. Hornwort stomata are large and scattered on sporangia that grow from their bases and release spores at their tips. We present data from development and immunocytochemistry that identify a role for hornwort stomata that is correlated with sporangial and spore maturation. We measured guard cells across the genera with stomata to assess developmental changes in size and to analyze any correlation with genome size. Stomata form at the base of the sporophyte in the green region, where they develop differential wall thickenings, form a pore, and die. Guard cells collapse inwardly, increase in surface area, and remain perched over a substomatal cavity and network of intercellular spaces that is initially fluid filled. Following pore formation, the sporophyte dries from the outside inwardly and continues to do so after guard cells die and collapse. Spore tetrads develop in spore mother cell walls within a mucilaginous matrix, both of which progressively dry before sporophyte dehiscence. A lack of correlation between guard cell size and DNA content, lack of arabinans in cell walls, and perpetually open pores are consistent with the inactivity of hornwort stomata. Stomata are expendable in hornworts, as they have been lost twice in derived taxa. Guard cells and epidermal cells of hornworts show striking similarities with the earliest plant fossils. Our findings identify an architecture and fate of stomata in hornworts that is ancient and common to plants without sporophytic leaves.</p>

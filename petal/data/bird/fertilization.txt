Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>ic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e genes reveals distinct vegetative and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>ic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

<i>De novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing mouse embryos originating from enucleolated zygotes
<p>The large, compact oocyte nucleoli, sometimes referred to as nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs), are essential for embryonic development in mammals; in their absence, the oocytes complete maturation and can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ized, but no nucleoli are formed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e or embryo, leading to developmental failure. It has been convincingly documented that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es inherit the oocyte nucleolar material and form NPBs again in pronuclei. It is commonly accepted that during early embryonic development, the original compact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e NPBs gradually transform into reticulated nucleoli of somatic cells. Here, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e NPBs are not required for embryonic and full-term development in the mouse. When NPBs were removed from late-stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es by micromanipulation, the enucleolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es developed to the blastocyst stage and, after transfer to recipients, live pups were obtained. We also describe <i>de novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing embryos. After removal of NPBs from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es, they formed new nucleoli after several divisions. These results indicate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e NPBs are not used in embryonic development and that the nucleoli in developing embryos originate from <i>de novo</i> synthesized materials.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice
<p>Increased oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of oxidative damage during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion. We tested whether the link between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and antioxidative capacity. We studied the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion on OS in females of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR females showed higher oxidative damage to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR females. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion did not affect oxidative damage to lipids in either line; however, it reduced damage to DNA in L-BMR females. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion increased catalase activity in liver (significantly stronger in L-BMR females) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS.</p>

Cysteine-rich peptides promote interspecific genetic isolation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive isolation is a prerequisite for speciation. Failure of communication between female tissues of the pistil and paternal pollen tubes imposes hybridization barriers in flowering plants. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> LURE1 (AtLURE1) peptides and their male receptor PRK6 aid attraction of the growing pollen tube to the ovule. Here, we report that the knockout of the entire <i>AtLURE1</i> gene family did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity, indicating that AtLURE1-PRK6–mediated signaling is not required for successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization within one <i>Arabidopsis</i> species. AtLURE1s instead function as pollen tube emergence accelerators that favor conspecific pollen over pollen from other species and thus promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive isolation. We also identified maternal peptides XIUQIU1 to -4, which attract pollen tubes regardless of species. Cooperation between ovule attraction and pollen tube growth acceleration favors conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive isolation.</p>

The Ly6/uPAR protein Bouncer is necessary and sufficient for species-specific fertilization
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization is fundamental for sexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion, yet its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We found that an oocyte-expressed Ly6/uPAR protein, which we call Bouncer, is a crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization factor in zebrafish. Membrane-bound Bouncer mediates sperm-egg binding and is thus essential for sperm entry into the egg. Remarkably, Bouncer not only is required for sperm-egg interaction but is also sufficient to allow cross-species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization between zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that diverged more than 200 million years ago. Our study thus identifies Bouncer as a key determinant of species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization in fish. Bouncer’s closest homolog in tetrapods, SPACA4, is restricted to the male germline in internally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>izing vertebrates, which suggests that our findings in fish have relevance to human biology.</p>

Social regulation of insulin signaling and the evolution of eusociality in ants
<p>Queens and workers of eusocial Hymenoptera are considered homologous to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive and brood care phases of an ancestral subsocial life cycle. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive division of labor remain obscure. Using a brain transcriptomics screen, we identified a single gene, <i>insulin-like peptide 2</i> (<i>ilp2</i>), which is always up-regulated in ant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ives, likely because they are better nourished than their non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive nestmates. In clonal raider ants (<i>Ooceraea biroi</i>), larval signals inhibit adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion by suppressing <i>ilp2</i>, thus producing a colony <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive cycle reminiscent of ancestral subsociality. However, increasing ILP2 peptide levels overrides larval suppression, thereby breaking the colony cycle and inducing a stable division of labor. These findings suggest a simple model for the origin of ant eusociality via nutritionally determined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive asymmetries potentially amplified by larval signals.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering plants, the female gametophyte controls pollen tube reception immediately before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and regulates seed development immediately after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for pollen tube reception by the female gametophyte before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and the initiation of seed development after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the female gametophyte and in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the developing seeds was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old seedlings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in pollen or pollen tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in seeds. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in seeds, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of seed development. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and supported the model that a passage through the female gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in seeds and controls early seed development.</p>

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C allocation to both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive and vegetative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in fruiting and non-fruiting trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion on C allocation to vegetative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting trees, fruiting reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting trees than non-fruiting trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of allocation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion affects C allocation to branches but not its source or storage. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Fish reproductive-energy output increases disproportionately with body size
<p>Body size determines total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive-energy output. Most theories assume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive output is a fixed proportion of size, with respect to mass, but formal macroecological tests are lacking. Management based on that assumption risks underestimating the contribution of larger mothers to replenishment, hindering sustainable harvesting. We test this assumption in marine fishes with a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of the intraspecific mass scaling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive-energy output. We show that larger mothers reproduce disproportionately more than smaller mothers in not only fecundity but also total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive energy. Our results reset much of the theory on how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion scales with size and suggest that larger mothers contribute disproportionately to population replenishment. Global change and overharvesting cause fish sizes to decline; our results provide quantitative estimates of how these declines affect fisheries and ecosystem-level productivity.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying post<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive isolation. A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>e gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>e gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive barriers.</p>

Increased homeothermy during reproduction in a basal placental mammal
<p>Homeothermic endothermy, the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) using heat produced by elevated metabolism, is energetically expensive. There is increasing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict homeothermy, allowed <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest-phase <i>T</i><sub>b</sub>. The high level of homeothermy observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that homeothermy allows for greater energetic output during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by measuring metabolic rates over a range of ambient temperatures in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive and non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive greater hedgehog tenrecs (<i>Setifer setosus</i>), a physiologically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest metabolic rates and highest levels of <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During pregnancy and lactation, there was an increase in metabolism and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at ~25°C. However, whereas increases in resting metabolism were substantial below 20°C (up to 150% higher during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion), daytime rest-phase ambient temperatures at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, <i>S. setosus</i> provide an example for how relatively low-cost increases in homeothermy could have led to substantial increases in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young. The mechanisms necessary for increases in thermogenesis during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion would have further benefited the development of homeothermy in mammals.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Molecular Characterization and Evolution of a Gene Family Encoding Both Female- and Male-Specific Reproductive Proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same sex. To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive genes that become “co-opted” by males, we screened female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive genes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in males that is transferred to females during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated genes that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the male RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and gene expression analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy gene that was female-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved male-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each gene in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one female-expressed gene is essential for full fecundity, and both female-expressed genes contribute singly or in combination to a female’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the male-expressed paralog had no significant effect on female fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this gene family exert effects on females by acting on a common, female-expressed target. After duplication and male co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

A regulatory circuit conferring varied flowering response to cold in annual and perennial plants
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive strategies of plants are highly variable. Short-lived annuals flower abundantly soon after germination, whereas longer-lived perennials postpone and spatially restrict flowering. We used CRISPR/Cas9 and interspecies gene transfer to understand divergence in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive patterns between annual and perennial crucifers. We show that in perennial <i>Arabis alpina</i>, flowering in response to winter cold depends on the floral integrator SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 15 (SPL15), whose activity is limited to older shoots and branches during cold exposure. In annuals, this regulatory system is conserved, but cold-induced flowering occurs in young shoots, without requirement for SPL15, through the photoperiodic pathway when plants return to warm. By reconstructing the annual response in perennials, we conclude that characteristic patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion in annuals and perennials are conferred through variation in dependency on distinct flowering pathways acting in parallel.</p>

Dual-spindle formation in zygotes keeps parental genomes apart in early mammalian embryos
<p>At the beginning of mammalian life, the genetic material from each parent meets when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ized egg divides. It was previously thought that a single microtubule spindle is responsible for spatially combining the two genomes and then segregating them to create the two-cell embryo. We used light-sheet microscopy to show that two bipolar spindles form in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e and then independently congress the maternal and paternal genomes. These two spindles aligned their poles before anaphase but kept the parental genomes apart during the first cleavage. This spindle assembly mechanism provides a potential rationale for erroneous divisions into more than two blastomeric nuclei observed in mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es and reveals the mechanism behind the observation that parental genomes occupy separate nuclear compartments in the two-cell embryo.</p>

Elimination of the male reproductive tract in the female embryo is promoted by COUP-TFII in mice
<p>The sexual differentiation paradigm contends that the female pattern of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive system is established by default because the male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tracts (Wolffian ducts) in the female degenerate owing to a lack of androgen. Here, we discovered that female mouse embryos lacking <i>Coup-tfII</i> (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II) in the Wolffian duct mesenchyme became intersex—possessing both female and male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tracts. Retention of Wolffian ducts was not caused by ectopic androgen production or action. Instead, enhanced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in Wolffian duct epithelium was responsible for the retention of male structures in an androgen-independent manner. We thus suggest that elimination of Wolffian ducts in female embryos is actively promoted by COUP-TFII, which suppresses a mesenchyme-epithelium cross-talk responsible for Wolffian duct maintenance.</p>

The ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 Complex Mediates Pollen Tube Growth by Coordinating Vacuolar Targeting and Organization
<p>Pollen tube growth is an essential step for successful plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion. Vacuolar trafficking and dynamic organization are important for pollen tube growth; however, the key proteins involved in these processes are not well understood. Here, we report that the ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 (AP-3) complex and its tonoplast cargo PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10) are critical for pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). AP-3 is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of four subunits, δ, β, µ, and σ. AP-3 regulates tonoplast targeting of several cargoes, such as PAT10. We show that functional loss of any of the four AP-3 subunits reduces plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity. In <i>ap-3</i> mutants, pollen development was normal but pollen tube growth was compromised, leading to reduced male transmission. Functional loss of <i>PAT10</i> caused a similar reduction in pollen tube growth, suggesting that the tonoplast association of PAT10 mediated by AP-3 is crucial for this process. Indeed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient during pollen tube growth was reduced significantly due to <i>AP-3</i> loss of function, consistent with the abnormal targeting of CALCINUERIN B-LIKE2 (CBL2) and CBL3, whose tonoplast association depends on PAT10. Furthermore, we show that the pollen tubes of <i>ap-3</i> mutants have vacuoles with simplified tubules and bulbous structures, indicating that AP-3 affects vacuolar organization. Our results demonstrate a role for AP-3 in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion and provide insights into the role of vacuoles in polarized cell growth.</p>

Transcription Factor MYB26 Is Key to Spatial Specificity in Anther Secondary Thickening Formation
<p>Successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization relies on the production and effective release of viable pollen. Failure of anther opening (dehiscence), results in male sterility, although the pollen may be fully functional. MYB26 regulates the formation of secondary thickening in the anther endothecium, which is critical for anther dehiscence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity. Here, we show that although the <i>MYB26</i> transcript shows expression in multiple floral organs, the MYB26 protein is localized specifically to the anther endothecium nuclei and that it directly regulates two <i>NAC</i> domain genes, <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, which are critical for the induction of secondary thickening biosynthesis genes. However, there is a complex relationship of regulation between these genes and MYB26. Using DEX-inducible MYB26 lines and overexpression in the various mutant backgrounds, we have shown that MYB26 up-regulates both <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> expression. Surprisingly normal thickening and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity rescue does not occur in the absence of MYB26, even with constitutively induced <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, suggesting an additional essential role for MYB26 in this regulation. Combined overexpression of <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> in <i>myb26</i> facilitates limited ectopic thickening in the anther epidermis, but not in the endothecium, and thus fails to rescue dehiscence. Therefore, by a series of regulatory controls through MYB26, NST1, NST2, secondary thickening is formed specifically within the endothecium; this specificity is essential for anther opening.</p>

Similarities between Reproductive and Immune Pistil Transcriptomes of <i>Arabidopsis</i> Species
<p>Independent lines of evidence suggest that members from ancient and polymorphic gene families such as defensins and receptor-like kinases mediate intercellular communication during both the immune response and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion. Here, we report a large-scale analysis to investigate the extent of overlap between these processes by comparing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the pistil transcriptomes of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> during self-pollination and interspecific pollination and during infection with <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>. In both <i>Arabidopsis</i> species, the largest number of DEGs was identified in infected pistils, where genes encoding regulators of cell division and development were most frequently down-regulated. Comparison of DEGs between infection and various pollination conditions showed that up to 79% of down-regulated genes are shared between conditions and include especially defensin-like genes. Interspecific pollination of <i>A.</i> <i>thaliana</i> significantly up-regulated thionins and defensins. The significant overrepresentation of similar groups of DEGs in the transcriptomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive and immune responses of the pistil makes it a prime system in which to study the consequences of plant-pathogen interactions on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity and the evolution of intercellular communication in pollination.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient temperature has a large impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity in response to ambient temperature in barley.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen development.</p>

Dynamics of the Pollen Sequestrome Defined by Subcellular Coupled Omics
<p>Reproduction success in angiosperm plants depends on robust pollen tube growth through the female pistil tissues to ensure successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization. Accordingly, there is an apparent evolutionary trend to accumulate significant reserves during pollen maturation, including a population of stored mRNAs, that are utilized later for a massive translation of various proteins in growing pollen tubes. Here, we performed a thorough transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of stored and translated transcripts in three subcellular compartments of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), long-term storage EDTA/puromycin-resistant particles, translating polysomes, and free ribonuclear particles, throughout tobacco pollen development and in in vitro-growing pollen tubes. We demonstrated that the composition of the aforementioned complexes is not rigid and that numerous transcripts were redistributed among these complexes during pollen development, which may represent an important mechanism of translational regulation. Therefore, we defined the pollen sequestrome as a distinct and highly dynamic compartment for the storage of stable, translationally repressed transcripts and demonstrated its dynamics. We propose that EDTA/puromycin-resistant particle complexes represent aggregated nontranslating monosomes as the primary mediators of messenger RNA sequestration. Such organization is extremely useful in fast tip-growing pollen tubes, where rapid and orchestrated protein synthesis must take place in specific regions.</p>

NMT1 and NMT3 <i>N</i>-Methyltransferase Activity Is Critical to Lipid Homeostasis, Morphogenesis, and Reproduction
<p>Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a major membrane phospholipid and a precursor for major signaling molecules. Understanding its synthesis is important for improving plant growth, nutritional value, and resistance to stress. PC synthesis is complex, involving several interconnected pathways, one of which proceeds from serine-derived phosphoethanolamine to form phosphocholine through three sequential phospho-base methylations catalyzed by phosphoethanolamine <i>N</i>-methyltransferases (PEAMTs). The contribution of this pathway to the production of PC and plant growth has been a matter of some debate. Although a handful of individual PEAMTs have been described, there has not been any in planta investigation of a PEAMT family. Here, we provide a comparative functional analysis of two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PEAMTs, NMT1 and the little known NMT3. Analysis of loss-of-function mutants demonstrates that NMT1 and NMT3 synergistically regulate PC homeostasis, phase transition at the shoot apex, coordinated organ development, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity through overlapping but also specific functions. The <i>nmt1 nmt3</i> double mutant shows extensive sterility, drastically reduced PC concentrations, and altered lipid profiles. These findings demonstrate that the phospho-base methylation pathway makes a major contribution to PC synthesis in Arabidopsis and that NMT1 and NMT3 play major roles in its catalysis and the regulation of PC homeostasis as well as in plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion.</p>

Reproductive Long Intergenic Noncoding RNAs Exhibit Male Gamete Specificity and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2-Mediated Repression
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been characterized extensively in animals and are involved in several processes, including homeobox gene expression and X-chromosome inactivation. In comparison, there has been much less detailed characterization of plant lncRNAs, and the number of distinct lncRNAs encoded in plant genomes and their regulation by developmental and epigenetic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we analyzed transcriptome data from Asian rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and identified 6,309 long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), focusing on their expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tissues and organs. Most <i>O. sativa</i> lincRNAs were expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner, with an unexpectedly high fraction specifically expressed in male gametes. Mutation of a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex2 (PRC2) resulted in derepression of another large class of lincRNAs, whose expression is correlated with H3K27 trimethylation in developing panicles. Overlap with the sperm cell-specific lincRNAs suggests that epigenetic repression of lincRNAs in the panicles was partially relieved in the male germline. Expression of a subset of lincRNAs also showed modulation by drought in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tissues. Comparison with other cereal genomes showed that the lincRNAs generally have low levels of conservation at both the sequence and structural levels. Use of a novelty detection support vector machine model enabled the detection of nucleotide sequence and structural homology in ∼10% and ∼4% of the lincRNAs in genomes of purple false brome (<i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), respectively. This is the first study to report on a large number of lncRNAs that are targets of repression by PRC2 rather than mediating regulation via PRC2. That the vast majority of the lincRNAs reported here do not overlap with those of other rice studies indicates that these are a significant addition to the known lincRNAs in rice.</p>

ALY RNA-Binding Proteins Are Required for Nucleocytosolic mRNA Transport and Modulate Plant Growth and Development
<p>The regulated transport of mRNAs from the cell nucleus to the cytosol is a critical step linking transcript synthesis and processing with translation. However, in plants, only a few of the factors that act in the mRNA export pathway have been functionally characterized. Flowering plant genomes encode several members of the ALY protein family, which function as mRNA export factors in other organisms. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ALY1 to ALY4 are commonly detected in root and leaf cells, but they are differentially expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tissue. Moreover, the subnuclear distribution of ALY1/2 differs from that of ALY3/4. ALY1 binds with higher affinity to single-stranded RNA than double-stranded RNA and single-stranded DNA and interacts preferentially with 5-methylcytosine-modified single-stranded RNA. Compared with the full-length protein, the individual RNA recognition motif of ALY1 binds RNA only weakly. ALY proteins interact with the RNA helicase UAP56, indicating a link to the mRNA export machinery. Consistently, ALY1 complements the lethal phenotype of yeast cells lacking the ALY1 ortholog Yra1. Whereas individual <i>aly</i> mutants have a wild-type appearance, disruption of <i>ALY1</i> to <i>ALY4</i> in <i>4xaly</i> plants causes vegetative and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive defects, including strongly reduced growth, altered flower morphology, as well as abnormal ovules and female gametophytes, causing reduced seed production. Moreover, polyadenylated mRNAs accumulate in the nuclei of <i>4xaly</i> cells. Our results highlight the requirement of efficient mRNA nucleocytosolic transport for proper plant growth and development and indicate that ALY1 to ALY4 act partly redundantly in this process; however, differences in expression and subnuclear localization suggest distinct functions.</p>

FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Plays a Dual Role in Regulating Type I MADS-Box Genes in Early Endosperm Development
<p>Early endosperm development presents a unique system in which to uncover epigenetic regulatory mechanisms because the contributing maternal and paternal genomes possess differential epigenetic modifications. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the initiation of endosperm coenocytic growth upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and the transition to endosperm cellularization are regulated by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>IZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS)-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a putative H3K27 methyltransferase. Here, we address the possible role of the FIS-PRC2 complex in regulating the type I MADS-box gene family, which has been shown previously to regulate early endosperm development. We show that a subclass of type I MADS-box genes (C2 genes) was expressed in distinct domains of the coenocytic endosperm in wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the C2 genes were mostly up-regulated biallelically during the extended coenocytic phase of endosperm development in the FIS-PRC2 mutant background. Using allele-specific expression analysis, we also identified a small subset of C2 genes subjected to FIS-PRC2-dependent maternal or FIS-PRC2-independent paternal imprinting. Our data support a dual role for the FIS-PRC2 complex in the regulation of C2 type I MADS-box genes, as evidenced by a generalized role in the repression of gene expression at both alleles associated with endosperm cellularization and a specialized role in silencing the maternal allele of imprinted genes.</p>

Trehalose 6-Phosphate Regulates Photosynthesis and Assimilate Partitioning in Reproductive Tissue<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) that expresses rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE1</i> (<i>TPP1</i>) from the rice <i>MADS6</i> promoter, which is active over the flowering period, produces higher yields than wild type. This yield increase occurs with or without drought conditions during flowering. To understand the mechanistic basis of the increased yield, we characterized gene expression and metabolite profiles in leaves and developing female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tissue, comprising florets, node, pith, and shank, over the flowering period with and without drought. The <i>MADS6</i> promoter was most active in the vasculature, particularly phloem companion cells in florets and pith, consistent with the largest decreases in trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) levels (2- to 3-fold) being found in pith and florets. Low T6P led to decreased gene expression for primary metabolism and increased gene expression for secondary metabolism, particularly lipid-related pathways. Despite similar changes in gene expression, the pith and floret displayed opposing assimilate profiles: sugars, sugar phosphates, amino acids, and lipids increased in florets, but decreased in pith. Possibly explaining this assimilate distribution, seven <i>SWEET</i> genes were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic plants. SnRK1 activity and the expression of the gene for the SnRK1 beta subunit, expression of SnRK1 marker genes, and endogenous trehalose pathway genes were also altered. Furthermore, leaves of the transgenic maize maintained a higher photosynthetic rate for a longer period compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that decreasing T6P in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tissues down-regulates primary metabolism and up-regulates secondary metabolism, resulting in different metabolite profiles in component tissues. Our data implicate T6P/ SnRK1 as a major regulator of whole-plant resource allocation for crop yield improvement.</p>

Cytokinin-Auxin Crosstalk in the Gynoecial Primordium Ensures Correct Domain Patterning<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium consists of two congenitally fused carpels made up of two lateral valve domains and two medial domains, which retain meristematic properties and later fuse to produce the female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive structures vital for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization. Polar auxin transport (PAT) is important for setting up distinct apical auxin signaling domains in the early floral meristem remnants allowing for lateral domain identity and outgrowth. Crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin plays an important role in the development of other meristematic tissues, but hormone interaction studies to date have focused on more accessible later-stage gynoecia and the spatiotemporal interactions pivotal for patterning of early gynoecium primordia remain unknown. Focusing on the earliest stages, we propose a cytokinin-auxin feedback model during early gynoecium patterning and hormone homeostasis. Our results suggest that cytokinin positively regulates auxin signaling in the incipient gynoecial primordium and strengthen the concept that cytokinin regulates auxin homeostasis during gynoecium development. Specifically, medial cytokinin promotes auxin biosynthesis components [<i>YUCCA1</i>/<i>4</i> (<i>YUC1</i>/<i>4</i>)] in, and PINFORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated auxin efflux from, the medial domain. The resulting laterally focused auxin signaling triggers <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN6</i> (<i>AHP6</i>), which then represses cytokinin signaling in a PAT-dependent feedback. Cytokinin also down-regulates PIN3, promoting auxin accumulation in the apex. The <i>yuc1</i>, <i>yuc4</i>, and <i>ahp6</i> mutants are hypersensitive to exogenous cytokinin and 1-napthylphthalamic acid (NPA), highlighting their role in mediolateral gynoecium patterning. In summary, these mechanisms self-regulate cytokinin and auxin signaling domains, ensuring correct domain specification and gynoecium development.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in plants could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most plants, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) plants overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects plant N use efficiency. The modified plants were grown under low, moderate, or high N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered plants allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type plants. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing plants displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control plants. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop plants with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O Function in Pollen Tube Reception Is Linked to Its Oligomerization and Subcellular Distribution
<p>Sexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion in flowering plants requires communication between synergid cells and a tip-elongating pollen tube (PT) for the successful delivery of sperm cells to the embryo sac. The reception of the PT relies on signaling within the synergid cell that ultimately leads to the degeneration of the receptive synergid and PT rupture, releasing the sperm cells for double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), NORTIA, a member of the MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O (MLO) family of proteins, plays a critical role in the communication processes regulating PT reception. In this study, we determined that MLO function in PT reception is dependent on MLO protein localization into a Golgi-associated compartment before PT arrival, indicating that PT-triggered regulation of the synergid secretory system is important for synergid function during pollination. Additionally, a structure-function analysis revealed that MLO homooligomerization, mediated by the amino-terminal region of the protein, and carboxyl-terminal tail identity both contribute to MLO activity during PT reception.</p>

We investigated systemic changes in the leaves of mycorrhized <i>Medicago truncatula</i> in conditions with no improved P<sub>i</sub> status and compared them with those induced by high-P<sub>i</sub> treatment in nonmycorrhized plants. Microarray-based genome-wide profiling indicated up-regulation by mycorrhization of genes involved in flavonoid, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis as well as enhanced expression of <i>MYC2</i>, the master regulator of JA-dependent responses. Accordingly, total anthocyanins and flavonoids increased, and most flavonoid species were enriched in AM leaves. Both the AM and P<sub>i</sub> treatments corepressed iron homeostasis genes, resulting in lower levels of available iron in leaves. In addition, higher levels of cytokinins were found in leaves of AM- and P<sub>i</sub>-treated plants, whereas the level of ABA was increased specifically in AM leaves. Foliar treatment of nonmycorrhized plants with either ABA or JA induced the up-regulation of <i>MYC2</i>, but only JA also induced the up-regulation of flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthetic genes. Based on these results, we propose that mycorrhization and P<sub>i</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization share cytokinin-mediated improved shoot growth, whereas enhanced ABA biosynthesis and JA-regulated flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthesis in leaves are specific to mycorrhization.</p>

Transcriptome Profiling of Wheat Inflorescence Development from Spikelet Initiation to Floral Patterning Identified Stage-Specific Regulatory Genes
<p>Early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive development in cereals is crucial for final grain number per spike and hence the yield potential of the crop. To date, however, no systematic analyses of gene expression profiles during this important process have been conducted for common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). Here, we studied the transcriptome profiles at four stages of early wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive development, from spikelet initiation to floral organ differentiation. <i>K</i>-means clustering and stage-specific transcript identification detected dynamically expressed homeologs of important transcription regulators in spikelet and floral meristems that may be involved in spikelet initiation, floret meristem specification, and floral organ patterning, as inferred from their homologs in model plants. Small RNA transcriptome sequencing discovered key microRNAs that were differentially expressed during wheat inflorescence development alongside their target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms for floral development may be conserved in cereals and Arabidopsis. Our analysis was further substantiated by the functional characterization of the <i>ARGONAUTE1d</i> (<i>AGO1d</i>) gene, which was initially expressed in stamen primordia and later in the tapetum during anther maturation. In agreement with its stage-specific expression pattern, the loss of function of the predominantly expressed B homeolog of <i>AGO1d</i> in a tetraploid durum wheat mutant resulted in smaller anthers with more in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>e pollens than the wild type and a reduced grain number per spike. Together, our work provides a first glimpse of the gene regulatory networks in wheat inflorescence development that may be pivotal for floral and grain development, highlighting potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve future wheat yields.</p>

SDG2-Mediated H3K4me3 Is Crucial for Chromatin Condensation and Mitotic Division during Male Gametogenesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming occurring during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion is crucial for both animal and plant development. Histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mark of transcriptional active euchromatin. While much has been learned in somatic cells, H3K4me3 deposition and function in gametophyte is poorly studied. Here, we demonstrate that SET DOMAIN GROUP2 (SDG2)-mediated H3K4me3 deposition participates in epigenetic reprogramming during Arabidopsis male gametogenesis. We show that loss of SDG2 barely affects meiosis and cell fate establishment of haploid cells. However, we found that SDG2 is critical for postmeiotic microspore development. Mitotic cell division progression is partly impaired in the loss-of-function <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant, particularly at the second mitosis setting up the two sperm cells. We demonstrate that SDG2 is involved in promoting chromatin decondensation in the pollen vegetative nucleus, likely through its role in H3K4me3 deposition, which prevents ectopic heterochromatic H3K9me2 speckle formation. Moreover, we found that derepression of the LTR retrotransposon <i>ATLANTYS1</i> is compromised in the vegetative cell of the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant pollen. Consistent with chromatin condensation and compromised transcription activity, pollen germination and pollen tube elongation, representing the key function of the vegetative cell in transporting sperm cells during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization, are inhibited in the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant. Taken together, we conclude that SDG2-mediated H3K4me3 is an essential epigenetic mark of the gametophyte chromatin landscape, playing critical roles in gamete mitotic cell cycle progression and pollen vegetative cell function during male gametogenesis and beyond.</p>

MAP Kinase PrMPK9-1 Contributes to the Self-Incompatibility Response
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) form important signaling modules for a variety of cellular responses in eukaryotic cells. In plants, MAPKs play key roles in growth and development as well as in immunity/stress responses. Pollen-pistil interactions are critical early events regulating pollination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and involve many signaling events. Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism to prevent self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and inbreeding in higher plants and also is known to utilize signaling to achieve incompatible pollen rejection. Although several pollen-expressed MAPKs exist, very little is known about their function. We previously identified a pollen-expressed MAPK (p56) from <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> that was rapidly activated during SI; several studies implicated its role in signaling to SI-induced programmed cell death involving a DEVDase. However, to date, the identity of the MAPK involved has been unknown. Here, we have identified and cloned a pollen-expressed <i>P. rhoeas</i> threonine-aspartate-tyrosine (TDY) MAPK, <i>PrMPK9-1</i>. Rather few data relating to the function of TDY MAPKs in plants currently exist. We provide evidence that <i>PrMPK9-1</i> has a cell type-specific function, with a distinct role from <i>AtMPK9</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first study implicating a function for a TDY MAPK in pollen. We show that PrMPK9-1 corresponds to p56 and demonstrate that it is functionally involved in mediating SI in <i>P. rhoeas</i> pollen: PrMPK9-1 is a key regulator for SI in pollen and acts upstream of programmed cell death involving actin and activation of a DEVDase. Our study provides an important advance in elucidating functional roles for this class of MAPKs.</p>

Concerted Divergence after Gene Duplication in Polycomb Repressive Complexes
<p>Duplicated genes are a major contributor to genome evolution and phenotypic novelty. There are multiple possible evolutionary fates of duplicated genes. Here, we provide an example of concerted divergence of simultaneously duplicated genes whose products function in the same complex. We studied POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX2 (PRC2) in Brassicaceae. The VERNALIZATION (VRN)-PRC2 complex contains VRN2 and SWINGER (SWN), and both genes were duplicated during a whole-genome duplication to generate FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2) and MEDEA (MEA), which function in the Brassicaceae-specific FIS-PRC2 complex that regulates seed development. We examined the expression of <i>FIS2</i>, <i>MEA</i>, and their paralogs, compared their cytosine and histone methylation patterns, and analyzed the sequence evolution of the genes. We found that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive-specific expression patterns that are correlated and derived from the broadly expressed <i>VRN2</i> and <i>SWN</i> in outgroup species. In vegetative tissues of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), repressive methylation marks are enriched in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>, whereas active marks are associated with their paralogs. We detected comparable accelerated amino acid substitution rates in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> but not in their paralogs. We also show divergence patterns of the PRC2-associated <i>VERNALIZATION5/VIN3-LIKE2</i> that are similar to <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>. These lines of evidence indicate that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have diverged in concert, resulting in functional divergence of the PRC2 complexes in Brassicaceae. This type of concerted divergence is a previously unreported fate of duplicated genes. In addition, the Brassicaceae-specific FIS-PRC2 complex modified the regulatory pathways in female gametophyte and seed development.</p>

Gain-of-Function Mutants of the Cytokinin Receptors AHK2 and AHK3 Regulate Plant Organ Size, Flowering Time and Plant Longevity
<p>The phytohormone cytokinin is a regulator of numerous processes in plants. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the cytokinin signal is perceived by three membrane-located receptors named ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE2 (AHK2), AHK3, and AHK4/CRE1. How the signal is transmitted across the membrane is an entirely unknown process. The three receptors have been shown to operate mostly in a redundant fashion, and very few specific roles have been attributed to single receptors. Using a forward genetic approach, we isolated constitutively active gain-of-function variants of the <i>AHK2</i> and <i>AHK3</i> genes, named <i>repressor of cytokinin deficiency2</i> (<i>rock2</i>) and <i>rock3</i>, respectively. It is hypothesized that the structural changes caused by these mutations in the sensory and adjacent transmembrane domains emulate the structural changes caused by cytokinin binding, resulting in domain motion propagating the signal across the membrane. Detailed analysis of lines carrying <i>rock2</i> and <i>rock3</i> alleles revealed how plants respond to locally enhanced cytokinin signaling. Early flowering time, a prolonged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive growth phase, and, thereby, increased seed yield suggest that cytokinin regulates various aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive growth. In particular, it counteracts the global proliferative arrest, a correlative inhibition of maternal growth by seeds, an as yet unknown activity of the hormone.</p>

Molecular Regulation of Temperature-Dependent Floral Induction in <i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>
<p>The vegetative-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive phase change in tulip (<i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>) is promoted by increasing temperatures during spring. The warm winters of recent years interfere with this process and are calling for new adapted cultivars. A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms would be of help, but unlike the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), very little is known about floral induction in tulip. To shed light on the gene regulatory network controlling flowering in tulip, RNA sequencing was performed on meristem-enriched tissue collected under two contrasting temperature conditions, low and high. The start of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive development correlated with rounding of the shoot apical meristem and induction of <i>TGSQA</i> expression, a tulip gene with a high similarity to Arabidopsis <i>APETALA1</i>. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed the overrepresentation of genes potentially involved in floral induction, bulb maturation, and dormancy establishment. Expression analysis revealed that <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TgTFL1</i>) and <i>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1-like1</i> (<i>TgSOC1-like1</i>) might be repressors, whereas <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> likely is an activator, of flowering. Subsequently, the flowering time-associated expression of eight potential flowering time genes was confirmed in three tulip cultivars grown in the field. Additionally, heterologous functional analyses in Arabidopsis resulted in flowering time phenotypes in line with <i>TgTFL1</i> being a floral repressor and <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> being a floral activator in tulip. Taken together, we have shown that long before morphological changes occur in the shoot apical meristem, the expression of floral repressors in tulip is suppressed by increased ambient temperatures, leading either directly or indirectly to the activation of potential flowering activators shortly before the commencement of the phase change.</p>

Structure-Activity Relation of AMOR Sugar Molecule That Activates Pollen-Tubes for Ovular Guidance
<p>Successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization in flowering plants depends on the precise directional growth control of pollen tube through the female pistil tissue toward the female gametophyte contained in the ovule for delivery of nonmotile sperm cells. Cys-rich peptides LUREs secreted from the synergid cells on either side of the egg cell act as ovular attractants of pollen tubes. Competency control by the pistil is crucial for the response of pollen tubes to these ovular attractants. We recently reported that ovular 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl arabinogalactan (AMOR) induces competency of the pollen tube to respond to ovular attractant LURE peptides in <i>Torenia fournieri.</i> The beta isomer of the terminal disaccharide 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl galactose was essential and sufficient for the competency induction. However, critical and noncritical structures in the disaccharide have not been dissected deeply. Herein, we report the synthesis of new AMOR analogs and the structure-activity relationships for AMOR activity in the presence of these synthesized analogs. Removal of 4-<i>O</i>-methyl group or –COOH from the glucuronosyl residue of the disaccharide dramatically reduces AMOR activity. The pyranose backbone of the second sugar of disaccharide is essential for the activity but not hydroxy groups. The role of beta isomer of the disaccharide 4-Me-GlcA-β(1,6)-Gal is very specific for competency control, as there was no difference in effect among the sugar analogs tested for pollen germination. This study represents the first structure-activity relationship study, to our knowledge, of a sugar molecule involved in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion, which opens a way for modification of the molecule without loss of activity.</p>

MONENSIN SENSITIVITY1 (MON1)/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-Mediated Rab7 Activation Regulates Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD)-triggered degradation of plant tapetum is essential for microspore development and pollen coat formation; however, little is known about the cellular mechanism regulating tapetal PCD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab7-mediated vacuolar transport of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases is crucial for tapetal PCD and pollen development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with the following evidence: (1) The <i>monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>mon1</i>) mutants, which are defective in Rab7 activation, showed impaired male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity due to a combined defect in both tapetum and male gametophyte development. (2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and pollen. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal pollen coat formation and decreased male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-mediated Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-mediated vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in defective pollen germination and tube growth. Taken together, tapetal PCD and pollen development require successful MON1/CCZ1-mediated vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

Gibberellin Induces Diploid Pollen Formation by Interfering with Meiotic Cytokinesis
<p>The plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA) controls many physiological processes, including cell differentiation, cell elongation, seed germination, and response to abiotic stress. In this study, we report that exogenous treatment of flowering Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants with GA specifically affects the process of male meiotic cytokinesis leading to meiotic restitution and the production of diploid (2n) pollen grains. Similar defects in meiotic cell division and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive ploidy stability occur in Arabidopsis plants depleted of RGA and GAI, two members of the DELLA family that function as suppressor of GA signaling. Cytological analysis of the double <i>rga-24 gai-t6</i> mutant revealed that defects in male meiotic cytokinesis are not caused by alterations in meiosis I (MI or meiosis II (MII) chromosome dynamics, but instead result from aberrations in the spatial organization of the phragmoplast-like radial microtubule arrays (RMAs) at the end of meiosis II. In line with a role for GA in the genetic regulation of the male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive system, we additionally show that DELLA downstream targets MYB33 and MYB65 are redundantly required for functional RMA biosynthesis and male meiotic cytokinesis. By analyzing the expression of <i>pRGA::GFP-RGA</i> in the wild-type Landsberg <i>erecta</i> background, we demonstrate that the GFP-RGA protein is specifically expressed in the anther cell layers surrounding the meiocytes and microspores, suggesting that appropriate GA signaling in the somatic anther tissue is critical for male meiotic cell wall formation and thus plays an important role in consolidating the male gametophytic ploidy consistency.</p>

A Photoreceptor Contributes to the Natural Variation of Diapause Induction in <i>Daphnia magna</i>
<p>Diapause is an adaptation that allows organisms to survive harsh environmental conditions. In species occurring over broad habitat ranges, both the timing and the intensity of diapause induction can vary across populations, revealing patterns of local adaptation. Understanding the genetic architecture of this fitness-related trait would help clarify how populations adapt to their local environments. In the cyclical parthenogenetic crustacean <i>Daphnia magna</i>, diapause induction is a phenotypic plastic life history trait linked to sexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion, as asexual females have the ability to switch to sexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion and produce resting stages, their sole strategy for surviving habitat deterioration. We have previously shown that the induction of resting stage production correlates with changes in photoperiod that indicate the imminence of habitat deterioration and have identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) responsible for some of the variation in the induction of resting stages. Here, new data allows us to anchor the QTL to a large scaffold and then, using a combination of a new mapping panel, targeted association mapping and selection analysis in natural populations, to identify candidate genes within the QTL. Our results show that variation in a rhodopsin photoreceptor gene plays a significant role in the variation observed in resting stage induction. This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the link between diapause and day-length perception that has been suggested in diverse arthropod taxa.</p>

Wide Variation in Reported Rates of Stroke Across Cohorts of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Oral anticoagulants decrease ischemic stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increase the risk of bleeding. For the average patient with AF, the threshold of annual ischemic stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> where the benefit of anticoagulation outweighs the bleeding risk (net clinical benefit) has been shown to be ≈1% to 2%. Guideline recommendations for oral anticoagulants in AF are based on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc stroke risk point scores, assuming that those scores translate to fixed stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. However, the relationship between stroke point scores and annual stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s may vary substantially across populations. We sought to comprehensively assess the reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of stroke in patients with AF and the relationship of stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s to stroke risk point scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic review of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials enrolled patients with nonvalvular AF not treated with oral anticoagulants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 3552 studies screened, we identified 34 studies eligible for analysis. Overall stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in cohort studies were highly heterogeneous (Q=5706.54, <i>P</i><0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.6%) and ranged from 0.45% to 9.28% per year, despite being of similar objective study quality. The mean North American stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was less than one-third that of the mean European stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, a random effects regression indicated that between-study variability was not significantly accounted for by cohort region, prospective versus retrospective design, calendar year of study, or outcome event cluster. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1, 76% of cohorts reported ischemic stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s <1% per year and only 18% of cohorts reported a stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> >2% per year. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 2, 27% of cohorts reported stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s below 1% per year, 40% reported stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s between 1 and 2% per year, and 33% reported stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s >2% per year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Substantial variation exists across cohorts in overall stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s corresponding to CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc point scores. These variations can affect the point score threshold for recommending oral anticoagulants in AF. The majority of cohorts did not observe stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s that would indicate a clear expected net clinical benefit for anticoagulating AF patients with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores of 1 or 2.</p></sec>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> knowledge of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> provides a base line for inferring expected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. We confirm that the crossover <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s: we estimate for bumblebees a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> in insects.</p>

Hospital Variation in Time to Epinephrine for Nonshockable In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>For patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests attributable to nonshockable rhythms, delays in epinephrine administration beyond 5 minutes is associated with worse survival. However, the extent of hospital variation in delayed epinephrine administration and its effect on hospital-level outcomes is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Within Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation, we identified 103 932 adult patients (≥18 years) at 548 hospitals with an in-hospital cardiac arrest attributable to a nonshockable rhythm who received at least 1 dose of epinephrine between 2000 and 2014. We constructed 2-level hierarchical regression models to quantify hospital variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of delayed epinephrine administration (>5 minutes) and its association with hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of survival to discharge and survival with functional recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 13 213 (12.7%) patients had delays to epinephrine, and this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> varied markedly across hospitals (range, 0%–53.8%). The odds of delay in epinephrine administration were 58% higher at 1 randomly selected hospital in comparison with a similar patient at another randomly selected hospital (median odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.51–1.64). The median risk-standardized survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 12.0% (range, 5.4%–31.9%), and the risk-standardized survival with functional recovery was 7.4% (range, 0.9%–30.8%). There was an inverse correlation between a hospital’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of delayed epinephrine administration and its risk-standardized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of survival to discharge (ρ=–0.22, <i>P</i><0.0001) and survival with functional recovery (ρ=–0.14, <i>P</i>=0.001). In comparison with a median survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of 12.9% (interquartile range, 11.1%–15.4%) at hospitals in the lowest quartile of epinephrine delay, risk-standardized survival was 16% lower at hospitals in the quartile with the highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of epinephrine delays (10.8%; interquartile range, 9.7%–12.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Delays in epinephrine administration following in-hospital cardiac arrest are common and variy across hospitals.

Canagliflozin for Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor that significantly reduces the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and elevated cardiovascular risk.

The primary prevention cohort comprised individuals ≥50 years of age with ≥2 risk factors for cardiovascular events but with no prior cardiovascular event, and the secondary prevention cohort comprised individuals ≥30 years of age with a prior cardiovascular event. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes included heart failure hospitalization and a renal composite (40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>, renal replacement therapy, or renal death).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Primary prevention participants (N=3486; 34%) were younger (63 versus 64 years of age), were more often female (45% versus 31%), and had a longer duration of diabetes mellitus (14 versus 13 years) compared with secondary prevention participants (N=6656; 66%).

Human mutation rate a legacy from our past
<p>Humans should be more like paramecia. That's because their mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> is orders of magnitude lower than a human's. Those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s increase when genes involved in copying or repairing DNA stop working correctly. Although some mutations are good for generating variety that allows organisms to adapt to changing environments, too many can cause disease and birth defects. At a meeting in Tempe, Arizona, researchers documented mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in dozens of species and found that the species's specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> is inversely related to the so-called "effective population" size. Small populations are less able to get rid of or compensate for genetic changes that increase mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. In the past, mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s were thought to be so stable that they were "molecular clocks" useful for dating species' divergences. But researchers are now recognizing that mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s vary from species to species.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Novel Mechanism, Linked to Cell Density, Largely Controls Cell Division in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>Many studies have investigated the various genetic and environmental factors regulating cyanobacterial growth. Here, we investigated the growth and metabolism of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 under different nitrogen sources, light intensities, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Cells grown on urea showed the highest growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. However, for all conditions tested, the daily growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in batch cultures decreased steadily over time, and stationary phase was obtained with similar cell densities. Unexpectedly, metabolic and physiological analyses showed that growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s during log phase were not controlled primarily by the availability of photoassimilates. Further physiological investigations indicated that nutrient limitation, quorum sensing, light quality, and light intensity (self-shading) were not the main factors responsible for the decrease in the growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> and the onset of the stationary phase. Moreover, cell division <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in fed-batch cultures were positively correlated with the dilution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. Hence, not only light, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nutrients can affect growth but also a cell-cell interaction. Accordingly, we propose that cell-cell interaction may be a factor responsible for the gradual decrease of growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in batch cultures during log phase, culminating with the onset of stationary phase.</p>

<sec><title>Background—</title><p>A major advantage of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) relative to percutaneous coronary intervention is its durability, yet there is a paucity of information on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and predictors of repeat coronary revascularization after CABG in the modern era.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We included patients ≥65 years from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons’ National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database who were undergoing first-time isolated CABG from 1991 to 2007 (n=723 134, median age 73 years). After linking to Medicare claims data, long-term outcomes of CABG (up to 18 years after surgery) were examined by use of cumulative incidence curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to identify factors associated with 1- and 5-year repeat revascularization trends and variability. We found that the overall 18-year survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 20%. Cumulative incidences of any repeat revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG, yet most often percutaneous coronary intervention) were 2%, 7%, 13%, and 16% at 1, 5, 10, and 18 years after surgery, respectively. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of repeat CABG procedures were quite low for all time points (0.1%, 0.6%, 1.3%, and 1.7%, respectively). Female sex, disease severity represented by a history of percutaneous coronary intervention, preoperative dialysis, and partial revascularization were strongly associated with a higher revascularization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>, whereas advanced age, left main disease, and smoking were associated with a lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. There was approximately a 2-fold variation in repeat revascularization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s across centers at 1 year (interquartile range 1.7–3.6%) and 5 years (interquartile range 6.7–12.0%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Repeat revascularization is performed infrequently among older patients who undergo CABG; however, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s vary substantially by patient subgroups and among providers.</p></sec>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease genetics, and conservation biology. To estimate mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ate the effect of selection on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin concentration. The maximum COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e was 10.4% of total hemoglobin concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Improving the accuracy of synovial fluid analysis in the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection with simple and inexpensive biomarkers
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to increase the diagnostic accuracy   of the analysis of synovial fluid in the differentiation of prosthetic   joint infection (PJI) by the addition of inexpensive biomarkers   such as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), adenosine deaminase   (ADA), alpha-2-macrogloblulin (α2M) and procalcitonin.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between January 2013 and December 2015, synovial fluid and removed   implants were requested from 143 revision total joint arthroplasties.   A total of 55 patients met inclusion criteria of the receipt of   sufficient synovial fluid, tissue samples and removed implants for   analysis.</p><p>The diagnosis of PJI followed the definition from a recent International   Consensus Meeting to create two groups of patients; septic and aseptic.   Using receiver operating characteristic curves we determined the   cutoff <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es and diagnostic accuracy for each marker.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 23 PJIs and 32 patients with aseptic loosening. The   levels of total leucocyte count, proportion of polymorphonuclear   leucocytes (PMNs), CRP, ADA and α2M in the synovial fluid were all   significantly higher in those with a PJI than in those with aseptic   loosening. The levels of procalcitonin were comparable in the two   groups.</p><p>Cutoff <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es for the optimal performance in the diagnosis of   infection were: total leucocyte count > 1463 cells/μL (sensitivity   (Sens) 100%, specificity (Spec) 71.9%, positive predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e   (PPV) 71.9%, negative predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e (NPV) 100%); proportion of   PMNs > 81% (Sens 78.3%, Spec 75.0%, PPV 69.2%, NPV 82.8%); CRP >   6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 93.8%, PPV 90.0%, NPV 85.7%); ADA > 61U/L   (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%) and α2M > 958 mg/L   (Sens 47.8%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 91.7%, NPV 72.1%).</p><p>The addition of a raised level of CRP or ADA to the total leukocyte   count increased the specificity: total leukocyte count > 1463 cells/μL   and CRP > 6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 86.5%) or   with ADA > 61U/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The total leucocyte count in the synovial fluid offers great   negative predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e in the diagnosis of PJI and the addition   of more specific markers such as CRP and ADA improves the positive   predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e.

Mortality and Cerebrovascular Events After Heart Rhythm Disorder Management Procedures
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of death and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder management (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in electrophysiology laboratories. Our primary aim was to assess and characterize death and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital deaths and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of death and CVE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s was performed for ablation, device implantation, electrophysiology study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively. Patients undergoing lead extraction had the highest overall mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> at 1.9% (95% CI, 1.34–2.61) and CVE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> at 0.62% (95% CI, 0.32–1.07). Among patients undergoing HRDM procedures, 48% of deaths directly related to the HDRM procedure were among patients undergoing device implantation procedures. Overall, cardiac tamponade was the most frequent direct cause of death (40%), and infection was the most common indirect cause of death (29%). The overall 30-day mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 0.76%, with the highest being in lead extraction procedures (3.08%), followed by device implantation procedures (0.94%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Half of the deaths directly related to an HRDM procedure were among the patients undergoing device implantation procedures, with cardiac tamponade being the most common cause of death.

Specialized Adult Congenital Heart Disease Care
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Clinical guidelines recommend specialized care for adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients. In reality, few patients receive such dedicated care. We sought to examine the impact of specialized care on ACHD patient mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined referral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s to specialized ACHD centers and ACHD patient mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s between 1990 and 2005 in the population-based Quebec Congenital Heart Disease database (n=71 467). This period covers several years before and after the publication of guidelines endorsing specialized care for ACHD patients. A time-series design, based on Joinpoint and Poisson regression analyses, was used to assess the changes in annual referral and patient mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. The association between specialized ACHD care and all-cause mortality was assessed in both case–control and cohort studies.

Atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C changes during the last glacial period from Hulu Cave
<p>Paired measurements of <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C and <sup>230</sup>Th ages from two Hulu Cave stalagmites complete a precise record of atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C covering the full range of the <sup>14</sup>C dating method (~54,000 years). Over the last glacial period, atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ranges from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es similar to modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es 1.70 times higher (42,000 to 39,000 years ago). The latter correspond to <sup>14</sup>C ages 5200 years less than calib<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d ages and correlate with the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion followed by Heinrich Stadial 4. Millennial-scale variations are largely attributable to Earth’s magnetic field changes and in part to climate-related changes in the oceanic carbon cycle. A progressive shift to lower <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es between 25,000 and 11,000 years ago is likely related, in part, to progressively increasing ocean ventilation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s.</p>

Interactions between brain and spinal cord mediate value effects in nocebo hyperalgesia
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e information about a drug, such as the price tag, can strongly affect its therapeutic effect. We discovered that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e information influences adverse treatment outcomes in humans even in the absence of an active substance. Labeling an inert treatment as expensive medication led to stronger nocebo hyperalgesia than labeling it as cheap medication. This effect was mediated by neural interactions between cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. In particular, activity in the prefrontal cortex mediated the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e on nocebo hyperalgesia. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e furthermore modulated coupling between prefrontal areas, brainstem, and spinal cord, which might represent a flexible mechanism through which higher-cognitive representations, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e, can modulate early pain processing.</p>

The fading American dream: Trends in absolute income mobility since 1940
<p>We estimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of “absolute income mobility”—the fraction of children who earn more than their parents—by combining data from U.S. Census and Current Population Survey cross sections with panel data from de-identified tax records. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of absolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90% for children born in 1940 to 50% for children born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that reviving the “American dream” of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of absolute mobility would require economic growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribution.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ate a comprehensive cu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s that are higher than growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The cu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

Genome-Wide Biases in the Rate and Molecular Spectrum of Spontaneous Mutations in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>
<p>The vast diversity in nucleotide composition and architecture among bacterial genomes may be partly explained by inherent biases in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and spectra of spontaneous mutations. Bacterial genomes with multiple chromosomes are relatively unusual but some are relevant to human health, none more so than the causative agent of cholera, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Here, we present the genome-wide mutation spectra in wild-type and mismatch repair (MMR) defective backgrounds of two <i>Vibrio</i> species, the low-%GC squid symbiont <i>V. fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>V. cholerae</i>, collected under conditions that greatly minimize the efficiency of natural selection. In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have among the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s for base-substitution mutations (bpsms) and insertion–deletion mutations (indels) that have been measured, below 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup>/genome/generation. <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have distinct mutation spectra, but both are AT-biased and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the mutation spectra of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific mutation patterns. Bpsm and indel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s varied among genome regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of genes on chromosome 2, which likely result from weaker purifying selection. More generally, the very low mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of <i>Vibrio</i> species correlate inversely with their immense population sizes and suggest that selection may not only have maximized replication fidelity but also optimized other polygenic traits relative to the constraints of genetic drift.</p>

Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–selection models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

The Roles of Mutation, Selection, and Expression in Determining Relative Rates of Evolution in Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genomes
<p>Eukaryotes rely on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) genomes, which interact within multisubunit complexes such as oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes. Although selection is thought to be less efficient on the asexual mt genome, in bilaterian animals the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<i>ω</i>) is lower in mt- compared with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, suggesting <i>stronger</i> effects of purifying selection in the mt genome. Because high levels of gene expression constrain protein sequence evolution, one proposed resolution to this paradox is that mt genes are expressed more highly than nuclear genes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated expression and sequence evolution of mt and nuclear genes from 84 diverse eukaryotes that vary in mt gene content and mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. We found that the relationship between mt and nuclear <i>ω</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es varied dramatically across eukaryotes. In contrast, transcript abundance is consistently higher for mt genes than nuclear genes, regardless of which genes happen to be in the mt genome. Consequently, expression levels cannot be responsible for the differences in <i>ω</i>. Rather, 84% of the variance in the ratio of <i>ω</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es between mt and nuclear genes could be explained by differences in mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> between the two genomes. We relate these findings to the hypothesis that high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of mt mutation select for compensatory changes in the nuclear genome. We also propose an explanation for why mt transcripts consistently outnumber their nuclear counterparts, with implications for mitonuclear protein imbalance and aging.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been measured previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> and drinking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

Predicting the 10-Year Risks of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in Chinese Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The accu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> assessment of individual risk can be of great <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e to guiding and facilitating the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, prediction models in common use were formulated primarily in white populations. The China-PAR project (Prediction for ASCVD Risk in China) is aimed at developing and validating 10-year risk prediction equations for ASCVD from 4 contemporary Chinese cohorts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Two prospective studies followed up together with a unified protocol were used as the derivation cohort to develop 10-year ASCVD risk equations in 21 320 Chinese participants. The external validation was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated in 2 independent Chinese cohorts with 14 123 and 70 838 participants. Furthermore, model performance was compared with the Pooled Cohort Equations reported in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Over 12 years of follow-up in the derivation cohort with 21 320 Chinese participants, 1048 subjects developed a first ASCVD event. Sex-specific equations had C statistics of 0.794 (95% confidence interval, 0.775–0.814) for men and 0.811 (95% confidence interval, 0.787–0.835) for women. The predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s were similar to the observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s, as indicated by a calibration χ<sup>2</sup> of 13.1 for men (<i>P</i>=0.16) and 12.8 for women (<i>P</i>=0.17). Good internal and external validations of our equations were achieved in subsequent analyses. Compared with the Chinese equations, the Pooled Cohort Equations had lower C statistics and much higher calibration χ<sup>2</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es in men.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our project developed effective tools with good performance for 10-year ASCVD risk prediction among a Chinese population that will help to improve the primary prevention and management of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec>

The diagnostic performance of radiographic criteria to detect aseptic acetabular component loosening after revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of radiographic   criteria to detect aseptic acetabular loosening after revision total   hip arthroplasty (THA). Secondary aims were to determine the predictive   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es of different thresholds of migration and to determine the   predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es of radiolucency criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Acetabular component migration to re-revision was measured retrospectively   using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup) and manual measurements   (Sutherland method) in two groups: Group A, 52 components (48 patients) found   not loose at re-revision and Group B, 42 components (36 patients)   found loose at re-revision between 1980 and 2015. The presence and   extent of radiolucent lines was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using EBRA, both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were   excellent diagnostic tests for detecting aseptic loosening. The   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was   0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The thresholds of 2.5 mm proximal translation   or 2° sagittal rotation (EBRA) in combination with radiolucency   criteria had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88% to detect   aseptic loosening. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e and negative predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e (NPV) of radiolucency criteria   were 41%, 100%, 100% and 68% respectively. Manual measurements of   both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were very good diagnostic tests.   The area under the ROC curve was 0.86 and 0.92 respectively. However,   manual measurements had a decreased specificity compared with EBRA.   Radiolucency criteria had a poor sensitivity and NPV of 41% and   68% respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that EBRA and manual migration measurements   can be used as accu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> diagnostic tools to detect aseptic loosening   of cementless acetabular components used at revision THA.

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>   of revision was not significantly higher in patients aged ≥ 70 years   (p = 0.93). The leading indications for revision were instability   (n = 22, 0.46%), infection (n = 20, 0.42%), aseptic femoral loosening   (n = 15, 0.31%) and femoral fracture (n = 6, 0.12%). There were   changes in the surgical technique with respect to the Corail femoral component   during the ten-year period involving a change to collared components   and a trend towards larger size. These resulted in a decrease in   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of iatrogenic femoral fracture and a decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>   of aseptic loosening.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of revision in this series is comparable with the best   performing THAs in registry data.

Inflammatory and Cholesterol Risk in the FOURIER Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Patients With Elevated Risk), the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular risk. It is not known whether the efficacy of evolocumab is modified by baseline inflammatory risk. We explored the efficacy of evolocumab stratified by baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). We also assessed the importance of inflammatory and residual cholesterol risk across the range of on-treatment LDL-C concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients (n=27 564) with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL on a statin were randomly assigned to evolocumab versus placebo and followed for a median of 2.2 years (1.8–2.5). The effects of evolocumab on the primary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization, and the key secondary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were compared across strata of baseline hsCRP (<1, 1–3, and >3 mg/dL). Outcomes were also assessed across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es for baseline hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C in the entire trial population. Multivariable models adjusted for variables associated with hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 7981 (29%) patients had a baseline hsCRP<1 mg/L, 11 177 (41%) had a hsCRP 1 to 3 mg/L, and 8337 (30%) had a hsCRP >3 mg/L. Median (interquartile range) baseline hsCRP was 1.8 (0.9–3.6) mg/L and levels were not altered by evolocumab (change at 48 weeks of –0.2 mg/dL [–1.0 to 0.4] in both treatment arms). In the placebo arm, patients in higher baseline hsCRP categories experienced significantly higher 3-year Kaplan-Meier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of the primary and key secondary end points: 12.0%, 13.7%, and 18.1% for the primary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) and 7.4%, 9.1%, and 13.2% for the key secondary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) for categories of <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/dL, respectively. The relative risk reductions for the primary end point and key secondary end point with evolocumab were consistent across hsCRP strata (<i>P</i>-interactions>0.15 for both). In contrast, the absolute risk reductions with evolocumab tended to be greater in patients with higher hsCRP: 1.6%, 1.8%, and 2.6% and 0.8%, 2.0%, and 3.0%, respectively, for the primary and key secondary end points across hsCRP strata.

ADHF hospitalizations were validated by standardized physician review and computer algorithm, yielding 40 173 events after accounting for sampling design (unweighted n=8746).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the ADHF hospitalizations, 50% had reduced ejection fraction, and 39% had preserved EF (HFpEF). HF with reduced ejection fraction was more common in black men and white men, whereas HFpEF was most common in white women. Average age-adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of ADHF were highest in blacks (38.1 per 1000 black men, 30.5 per 1000 black women), with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s differing by HF type and sex. ADHF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s increased over the 10 years (average annual percentage change: black women +4.3%, black men +3.7%, white women +1.9%, white men +2.6%), mostly reflecting more acute HFpEF.

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hemodynamic variables such as cardiac index and right atrial pressure have consistently been associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at the time of diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH.

The primary outcome was death or lung transplantation. We used stepwise Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess variables obtained at baseline and at first follow-up RHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 981 patients, a primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (33.7%) over a median follow-up duration of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.6 years). In a multivariable model considering only baseline variables, no hemodynamic variables independently predicted prognosis. Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial pressure were independently associated with death or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial pressure was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase. Among patients who had 2 (n=355) or 3 (n=193) low-risk prognostic features at follow-up, including a cardiac index ≥2.5 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>, 6-minute walk distance >440 m, and New York Heart Association class I or II functional class, lower SVI was still associated with higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of death or lung transplantation (<i>P</i><0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SVI and right atrial pressure were the hemodynamic variables that were independently associated with death or lung transplantation at first follow-up RHC after initial PAH treatment. These findings suggest that the SVI could be a more appropriate treatment target than cardiac index in PAH.</p></sec>

Frequency, Predictors, and Impact of Combined Antiplatelet Therapy on Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Symptomatic Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies suggest that symptomatic atherosclerosis may be associated with risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Prior randomized studies have demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d a significant reduction in recurrent VTE with aspirin monotherapy. Whether VTE risk is associated with more severe symptomatic atherosclerosis and more intensive antiplatelet therapy reduces VTE risk beyond aspirin monotherapy is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRA2P-TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) (vorapaxar) and PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) (ticagrelor) were blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trials of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of ischemic events in stable patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis. Two blinded vascular specialists systematically identified symptomatic venous thromboembolic events in both trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 47 611 patients with stable vascular disease followed for 3 years in both studies there were 343 VTE events in 301 patients (Kaplan-Meier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> at 3 years, 0.9% for placebo). The risk of VTE was independently associated with age, body mass index, polyvascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancy. The burden of atherosclerosis manifested as an increasing number of symptomatic vascular territories was associated with a graded increase in the 3-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of VTE (0.76% for 1, 1.53% for 2, and 2.45% for 3 territories). More intensive antiplatelet therapy (vorapaxar and ticagrelor pooled) significantly reduced the risk of VTE by 29% compared with background antiplatelet therapy, from 0.93% to 0.64% at 3 years (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of VTE in patients with atherosclerosis is ≈0.3% per year while on treatment with ≥1 antiplatelet agent, with increased risk independently associated with the number of symptomatic vascular territories.

High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin and the Risk Stratification of Patients With Renal Impairment Presenting With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may improve the risk stratification and diagnosis of myocardial infarction, but concentrations can be challenging to interpret in patients with renal impairment, and the effectiveness of testing in this group is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter study of consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated the performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in those with and without renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> <60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). The negative predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e and sensitivity of troponin concentrations below the risk stratification threshold (5 ng/L) at presentation were reported for a primary outcome of index type 1 myocardial infarction, or type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. The positive predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e and specificity at the 99th centile diagnostic threshold (16 ng/L in women, 34 ng/L in men) was determined for index type 1 myocardial infarction. Subsequent type 1 myocardial infarction and cardiac death were reported at 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 4726 patients identified, 904 (19%) had renal impairment. Troponin concentrations <5 ng/L at presentation identified 17% of patients with renal impairment as low risk for the primary outcome (negative predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e, 98.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 96.0%–99.7%; sensitivity 98.9%; 95%CI, 97.5%–99.9%), in comparison with 56% without renal impairment (<i>P</i><0.001) with similar performance (negative predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e, 99.7%; 95% CI, 99.4%–99.9%; sensitivity 98.4%; 95% CI, 97.2%–99.4%). The positive predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e and specificity at the 99th centile were lower in patients with renal impairment at 50.0% (95% CI, 45.2%–54.8%) and 70.9% (95% CI, 67.5%–74.2%), respectively, in comparison with 62.4% (95% CI, 58.8%–65.9%) and 92.1% (95% CI, 91.2%–93.0%) in those without. At 1 year, patients with troponin concentrations >99th centile and renal impairment were at greater risk of subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiac death than those with normal renal function (24% versus 10%; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.54–3.11).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In suspected acute coronary syndrome, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin identified fewer patients with renal impairment as low risk and more as high risk, but with lower specificity for type 1 myocardial infarction. Irrespective of diagnosis, patients with renal impairment and elevated cardiac troponin concentrations had a 2-fold greater risk of a major cardiac event than those with normal renal function, and should be considered for further investigation and treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

ICare-ACS (Improving Care Processes for Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to safely reduce length of stay for emergency department patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have had mixed success. Few system-wide efforts affecting multiple hospital emergency departments have ever been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated the effectiveness of a nationwide implementation of clinical pathways for potential ACS in dispa<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter pragmatic stepped-wedge before-and-after trial in 7 New Zealand acute care hospitals with 31 332 patients investigated for suspected ACS with serial troponin measurements. The implementation was a clinical pathway for the assessment of patients with suspected ACS that included a clinical pathway document in paper or electronic format, structured risk stratification, specified time points for electrocardiographic and serial troponin testing within 3 hours of arrival, and directions for combining risk stratification and electrocardiographic and troponin testing in an accele<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d diagnostic protocol. Implementation was monitored for >4 months and compared with usual care over the preceding 6 months. The main outcome measure was the odds of discharge within 6 hours of presentation</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 11 529 participants in the preimplementation phase (range, 284–3465) and 19 803 in the postimplementation phase (range, 395–5039). Overall, the mean 6-hour discharge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> increased from 8.3% (range, 2.7%–37.7%) to 18.4% (6.8%–43.8%). The odds of being discharged within 6 hours increased after clinical pathway implementation. The odds ratio was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.3–2.6). In patients without ACS, the median length of hospital stays decreased by 2.9 hours (95% confidence interval, 2.4–3.4). For patients discharged within 6 hours, there was no change in 30-day major adverse cardiac event <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s (0.52% versus 0.44%; <i>P</i>=0.96).

Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest that prescription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s for statins remain low in these patients. National <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of screening, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the 1999 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to estimate prevalence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of self-reported screening, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% (standard error, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (standard error, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol screening and awareness was high (>80%) among adults with definite/probable FH or severe dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [standard error, 8.2%] of adults with definite/probable FH and 37.6% [standard error, 1.2%] of adults with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol screening and awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest risk for lack of screening and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to improve the frequency of cholesterol screening and statin prescription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s to better identify and treat this high-risk population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to close these gaps in screening and treatment.</p></sec>

Geographic Variation in Cardiac Rehabilitation Participation in Medicare and Veterans Affairs Populations
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation is strongly recommended after myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery, but it is historically underused. We sought to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ate variation in cardiac rehabilitation participation across the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From administrative data from the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system and a 5% Medicare sample, we used International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes to identify patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery from 2007 to 2011. After excluding patients who died in ≤30 days of hospitalization, we calculated the percentage of patients who participated in ≥1 outpatient visits for cardiac rehabilitation during the 12 months after hospitalization. We estimated adjusted and standardized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of participation in cardiac rehabilitation by state using hierarchical logistic regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, participation in cardiac rehabilitation was 16.3% (23 403/143 756) in Medicare and 10.3% (9123/88 826) in VA. However, participation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s varied widely across states, ranging from 3.2% to 41.8% in Medicare and 1.2% to 47.6% in VA. Similar regional variation was observed in both populations. Patients in the West North Central region (Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) had the highest participation, whereas those in the Pacific region (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington) had the lowest participation in both Medicare (33.7% versus 10.6%) and VA (16.6% versus 5.1%) populations. Significant hospital-level variation was also present, with participation ranging from 3% to 75% in Medicare and 1% to 43% in VA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation participation remains low overall in both Medicare and VA populations. However, remarkably similar regional variation exists, with some regions and hospitals achieving high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of participation in both populations. This provides an opportunity to identify best practices from higher performing hospitals and regions that could be used to improve cardiac rehabilitation participation in lower performing hospitals and regions.</p></sec>

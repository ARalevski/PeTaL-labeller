Single-cell whole-genome analyses by Linear Amplification via Transposon Insertion (LIANTI)
<p>Single-cell genomics is important for biology and medicine. However, current whole-genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication (WGA) methods are limited by low accuracy of copy-number variation (CNV) detection and low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication fidelity. Here we report an improved single-cell WGA method, Linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication via Transposon Insertion (LIANTI), which outperforms existing methods, enabling micro-CNV detection with kilobase resolution. This allowed direct observation of stochastic firing of DNA replication origins, which differs from cell to cell. We also show that the predominant cytosine-to-thymine mutations observed in single-cell genomics often arise from the artifact of cytosine deamination upon cell lysis. However, identifying single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) can be accomplished by sequencing kindred cells. We determined the spectrum of SNVs in a single human cell after ultraviolet radiation, revealing their nonrandom genome-wide distribution.</p>

Printed subthreshold organic transistors operating at high gain and ultralow power
<p>Overcoming the trade-offs among power consumption, fabrication cost, and signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication has been a long-standing issue for wearable electronics. We report a high-gain, fully inkjet-printed Schottky barrier organic thin-film transistor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ier circuit. The transistor signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication efficiency is 38.2 siemens per ampere, which is near the theoretical thermionic limit, with an ultralow power consumption of <1 nanowatt. The use of a Schottky barrier for the source gave the transistor geometry-independent electrical characteristics and accommodated the large dimensional variation in inkjet-printed features. These transistors exhibited good reliability with negligible threshold-voltage shift. We demonstrated this capability with an ultralow-power high-gain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ier for the detection of electrophysiological signals and showed a signal-to-noise ratio of >60 decibels and noise voltage of <0.3 microvolt per hertz<sup>1/2</sup> at 100 hertz.</p>

Three-dimensional genome structures of single diploid human cells
<p>Three-dimensional genome structures play a key role in gene regulation and cell functions. Characterization of genome structures necessitates single-cell measurements. This has been achieved for haploid cells but has remained a challenge for diploid cells. We developed a single-cell chromatin conformation capture method, termed Dip-C, that combines a transposon-based whole-genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication method to detect many chromatin contacts, called META (multiplex end-tagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication), and an algorithm to impute the two chromosome haplotypes linked by each contact. We reconstructed the genome structures of single diploid human cells from a lymphoblastoid cell line and from primary blood cells with high spatial resolution, locating specific single-nucleotide and copy number variations in the nucleus. The two alleles of imprinted loci and the two X chromosomes were structurally different. Cells of different types displayed statistically distinct genome structures. Such structural cell typing is crucial for understanding cell functions.</p>

Light amplification by seeded Kerr instability
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of femtosecond laser pulses typically requires a lasing medium or a nonlinear crystal. In either case, the chemical properties of the lasing medium or the momentum conservation in the nonlinear crystal constrain the frequency and the bandwidth of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ied pulses. We demonstrate high gain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication (greater than 1000) of widely tunable (0.5 to 2.2 micrometers) and short (less than 60 femtosecond) laser pulses, up to intensities of 1 terawatt per square centimeter, by seeding the modulation instability in an Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> crystal pumped by femtosecond near-infrared pulses. Our method avoids constraints related to doping and phase matching and therefore can occur in a wider pool of glasses and crystals even at far-infrared frequencies and for single-cycle pulses.

Mapping the malaria parasite druggable genome by using in vitro evolution and chemogenomics
<p>Chemogenetic characterization through in vitro evolution combined with whole-genome analysis can identify antimalarial drug targets and drug-resistance genes. We performed a genome analysis of 262 <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites resistant to 37 diverse compounds. We found 159 gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ications and 148 nonsynonymous changes in 83 genes associated with drug-resistance acquisition, where gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ications contributed to one-third of resistance acquisition events. Beyond confirming previously identified multidrug-resistance mechanisms, we discovered hitherto unrecognized drug target–inhibitor pairs, including thymidylate synthase and a benzoquinazolinone, farnesyltransferase and a pyrimidinedione, and a dipeptidylpeptidase and an arylurea. This exploration of the <i>P. falciparum</i> resistome and druggable genome will likely guide drug discovery and structural biology efforts, while also advancing our understanding of resistance mechanisms available to the malaria parasite.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ied at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ied <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ied foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into chromosomes. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

Identification of a New Host Factor Required for Antiviral RNAi and Amplification of Viral siRNAs
<p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are processed from virus-specific dsRNA to direct antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) in diverse eukaryotic hosts. We have recently performed a sensitized genetic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and identified two related phospholipid flippases required for antiviral RNAi and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of virus-derived siRNAs by plant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase1 (RDR1) and RDR6. Here we report the identification and cloning of <i>ANTIVIRAL RNAI</i>-<i>DEFECTIVE2</i> (<i>AVI2</i>) from the same genetic screen. <i>AVI2</i> encodes a multispan transmembrane protein broadly conserved in plants and animals with two homologous human proteins known as magnesium transporters. We show that <i>avi2</i> mutant plants display no developmental defects and develop severe disease symptoms after infection with a mutant <i>Cucumber mosaic virus</i> (CMV) defective in RNAi suppression. <i>AVI2</i> is induced by CMV infection, particularly in veins, and is required for antiviral RNAi and RDR6-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs. AVI2 is also necessary for Dicer-like2-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs induced in <i>dcl4</i> mutant plants by infection, but dispensable for RDR6-dependent biogenesis of endogenous transacting siRNAs. Further genetic studies illustrate that AVI2 plays a partially redundant role with AVI2H, the most closely related member in the <i>AVI2</i> gene family, in RDR1-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs and the endogenous virus-activated siRNAs (vasi-RNAs). Interestingly, we discovered a specific genetic interaction of AVI2 with AVI1 flippase that is critical for plant development. We propose that AVI1 and AVI2 participate in the virus-induced formation of the RDR1/RDR6-specific, membrane-bound RNA synthesis compartment, essential for the biogenesis of highly abundant viral siRNAs and vasi-RNAs.</p>

A Genetic Screen for Impaired Systemic RNAi Highlights the Crucial Role of DICER-LIKE 2
<p>Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of transgenes involves abundant 21-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and low-abundance 22-nucleotide siRNAs produced from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by DCL4 and DCL2, respectively. However, DCL2 facilitates the recruitment of RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) to ARGONAUTE 1-derived cleavage products, resulting in more efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of secondary and transitive dsRNA and siRNAs. Here, we describe a reporter system where RDR6-dependent PTGS is initiated by restricted expression of an inverted-repeat dsRNA specifically in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root tip, allowing a genetic screen to identify mutants impaired in RDR6-dependent systemic PTGS. Our screen identified <i>dcl2</i> but not <i>dcl4</i> mutants. Moreover, grafting experiments showed that DCL2, but not DCL4, is required in both the source rootstock and the recipient shoot tissue for efficient RDR6-dependent systemic PTGS. Furthermore, <i>dcl4</i> rootstocks produced more DCL2-dependent 22-nucleotide siRNAs than the wild type and showed enhanced systemic movement of PTGS to grafted shoots. Thus, along with its role in recruiting RDR6 for further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of PTGS, DCL2 is crucial for RDR6-dependent systemic PTGS.</p>

Physical Mapping of Amplified Copies of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Glyphosate-Resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Recent and rapid evolution of resistance to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicides, in several weed species, including common waterhemp (<i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>), poses a serious threat to sustained crop production. We report that glyphosate resistance in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> was due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-P synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) gene, which encodes the molecular target of glyphosate. There was a positive correlation between <i>EPSPS</i> gene copies and its transcript expression. We analyzed the distribution of <i>EPSPS</i> copies in the genome of <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> using fluorescence in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis mapped the <i>EPSPS</i> gene to pericentromeric regions of two homologous chromosomes in glyphosate sensitive <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>. In glyphosate-resistant plants, a cluster of <i>EPSPS</i> genes on the pericentromeric region on one pair of homologous chromosomes was detected. Intriguingly, two highly glyphosate-resistant plants harbored an additional chromosome with several <i>EPSPS</i> copies besides the native chromosome pair with <i>EPSPS</i> copies. These results suggest that the initial event of <i>EPSPS</i> gene duplication may have occurred because of unequal recombination mediated by repetitive DNA. Subsequently, gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication may have resulted via several other mechanisms, such as chromosomal rearrangements, deletion/insertion, transposon-mediated dispersion, or possibly by interspecific hybridization. This report illustrates the physical mapping of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ied <i>EPSPS</i> copies in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
High Fitness Costs and Instability of Gene Duplications Reduce Rates of Evolution of New Genes by Duplication-Divergence Mechanisms
<p>An important mechanism for generation of new genes is by duplication-divergence of existing genes. Duplication-divergence includes several different submodels, such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of neutral mutations the original function is distributed between two partially functional and complementary genes, and neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the fitness cost and genetic stability of the duplications. Here, we determined the fitness cost and stability of defined gene duplications/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ications on a low copy number plasmid. Our experimental results show that the costs of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each additional kilo base pairs of DNA reduces fitness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the fitness costs and instability strongly reduces the likelihood of both sub- and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial functions.</p>

Manganese activates NLRP3 inflammasome signaling and propagates exosomal release of ASC in microglial cells
<p>Chronic, sustained inflammation underlies many pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. Divalent manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) exposure can stimulate neurotoxicity by increasing inflammation. In this study, we examined whether Mn<sup>2+</sup> activates the multiprotein NLRP3 inflammasome complex to promote neuroinflammation. Exposing activated mouse microglial cells to Mn<sup>2+</sup> substantially augmented NLRP3 abundance, caspase-1 cleavage, and maturation of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Exposure of mice to Mn<sup>2+</sup> had similar effects in brain microglial cells. Furthermore, Mn<sup>2+</sup> impaired mitochondrial ATP generation, basal respiratory rate, and spare capacity in microglial cells. These data suggest that Mn-induced mitochondrial defects drove the inflammasome signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication. We found that Mn induced cell-to-cell transfer of the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC in exosomes. Furthermore, primed microglial cells exposed to exosomes from Mn-treated mice released more IL-1β than did cells exposed to exosomes from control-treated animals. We also observed that welders exposed to manganese-containing fumes had plasma exosomes that contained more ASC than did those from a matched control group. Together, these results suggest that the divalent metal manganese acts as a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ier of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling and exosomal ASC release.</p>

IL-17 integrates multiple self-reinforcing, feed-forward mechanisms through the RNA binding protein Arid5a
<p>Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) not only stimulates immunity to fungal pathogens but also contributes to autoimmune pathology. IL-17 is only a modest activator of transcription in experimental tissue culture settings. However, IL-17 controls posttranscriptional events that enhance the expression of target mRNAs. Here, we showed that the RNA binding protein (RBP) Arid5a (AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 5a) integrated multiple IL-17–driven signaling pathways through posttranscriptional control of mRNA. IL-17 induced expression of Arid5a, which was recruited to the adaptor TRAF2. Arid5a stabilized IL-17–induced cytokine transcripts by binding to their 3′ untranslated regions and also counteracted mRNA degradation mediated by the endoribonuclease MCPIP1 (Regnase-1). Arid5a inducibly associated with the eukaryotic translation initiation complex and facilitated the translation of the transcription factors (TFs) IκBζ (<i>Nfkbiz</i> ) and C/EBPβ (<i>Cebpb</i>). These TFs in turn transactivated IL-17–dependent promoters. Together, these data indicated that Arid5a orchestrates a feed-forward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication loop, which promoted IL-17 signaling by controlling mRNA stability and translation.</p>

Tuning ITAM multiplicity on T cell receptors can control potency and selectivity to ligand density
<p>The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) recognizes peptides from pathogenic proteins bound in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). To convert this binding event into downstream signaling, the TCR complex contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) that act as docking sites for the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase ZAP-70. Unique among antigen receptors, the TCR complex uses 10 ITAMs to transduce peptide-MHC binding to the cell interior. Using synthetic, drug-inducible receptor-ligand pairs, it was found that greater ITAM multiplicity primarily enhanced the efficiency with which ligand binding was converted into an intracellular signal. This manifested as an increase in the fraction of cells that became activated in response to antigen, and a more synchronous initiation of TCR-proximal signaling, rather than direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of the intracellular signals. Exploiting these findings, the potency and selectivity of chimeric antigen receptors targeted against cancer were substantially enhanced by modulating the number of encoded ITAMs.</p>

Skp2-dependent reactivation of AKT drives resistance to PI3K inhibitors
<p>The PI3K-AKT kinase signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers, particularly breast cancer, where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication and somatic mutations of <i>PIK3CA</i> occur with high frequency in patients. Numerous small-molecule inhibitors targeting both PI3K and AKT are under clinical evaluation, but dose-limiting toxicities and the emergence of resistance limit therapeutic efficacy. Various resistance mechanisms to PI3K inhibitors have been identified, including de novo mutations, feedback activation of AKT, or cross-talk pathways. We found a previously unknown resistance mechanism to PI3K pathway inhibition that results in AKT rebound activation. In a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, treatment with a PI3K inhibitor or depletion of <i>PIK3CA</i> expression ultimately promoted AKT reactivation in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2, the kinases IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and the cell growth and metabolism-regulating complex mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2), but was independent of PI3K activity or PIP<sub>3</sub> production. Resistance to PI3K inhibitors correlated with the increased abundance of Skp2, ubiquitylation of AKT, cell proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. These findings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K inhibitor resistance may emerge in aggressive breast cancer cells.</p>

Dosage-dependent regulation of <i>VAV2</i> expression by steroidogenic factor-1 drives adrenocortical carcinoma cell invasion
<p>Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine malignancy with a dismal prognosis. Genomic studies have enabled progress in our understanding of the molecular bases of ACC, but factors that influence its prognosis are lacking. Amplification of the gene encoding the transcription factor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1; also known as NR5A1) is one of the genetic alterations common in ACC. We identified a transcriptional regulatory mechanism involving increased abundance of VAV2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for small GTPases that control the cytoskeleton, driven by increased expression of the gene encoding SF-1 in ACC. Manipulating SF-1 and VAV2 abundance in cultured ACC cells revealed that VAV2 was a critical factor for SF-1–induced cytoskeletal remodeling and invasion in culture (Matrigel) and in vivo (chicken chorioallantoic membrane) models. Analysis of ACC patient cohorts indicated that greater VAV2 abundance robustly correlated with poor prognosis in ACC patients. Because VAV2 is a druggable target, our findings suggest that blocking VAV2 may be a new therapeutic approach to inhibit metastatic progression in ACC patients.</p>

Pentraxin-3 is a PI3K signaling target that promotes stem cell–like traits in basal-like breast cancers
<p>Basal-like breast cancers (BLBCs) exhibit hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway because of the frequent mutational activation of the <i>PIK3CA</i> catalytic subunit and the genetic loss of its negative regulators PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and INPP4B (inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type II). However, PI3K inhibitors have had limited clinical efficacy in BLBC management because of compensatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of PI3K downstream signaling loops. Therefore, identification of critical PI3K mediators is paramount to the development of effective BLBC therapeutics. Using transcriptomic analysis of activated PIK3CA–expressing BLBC cells, we identified the gene encoding the humoral pattern recognition molecule pentraxin-3 (PTX3) as a critical target of oncogenic PI3K signaling. We found that PTX3 abundance is stimulated, in part, through AKT- and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)–dependent pathways and that presence of PTX3 is necessary for PI3K-induced stem cell–like traits. We further showed that <i>PTX3</i> expression is greater in tumor samples from patients with BLBC and that it is prognostic of poor patient survival. Our results thus reveal PTX3 as a newly identified PI3K-regulated biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in BLBC.</p>

Human tumor genomics and zebrafish modeling identify <i>SPRED1</i> loss as a driver of mucosal melanoma

Four distinct genotypes were associated with <i>SPRED1</i> loss. Using a rapid, tissue-specific CRISPR technique to model these genotypes in zebrafish, we found that <i>SPRED1</i> functions as a tumor suppressor, particularly in the context of <i>KIT</i> mutations. <i>SPRED1</i> knockdown caused MAPK activation, increased cell proliferation, and conferred resistance to drugs inhibiting KIT tyrosine kinase activity. These findings provide a rationale for MAPK inhibition in SPRED1-deficient melanomas and introduce a zebrafish modeling approach that can be used more generally to dissect genetic interactions in cancer.</p>

CRISPR-Cas12a target binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity
<p>CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) proteins are RNA-guided enzymes that bind and cut DNA as components of bacterial adaptive immune systems. Like CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a has been harnessed for genome editing on the basis of its ability to generate targeted, double-stranded DNA breaks. Here we show that RNA-guided DNA binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity by Cas12a that completely degrades ssDNA molecules. We find that target-activated, nonspecific single-stranded deoxyribonuclease (ssDNase) cleavage is also a property of other type V CRISPR-Cas12 enzymes. By combining Cas12a ssDNase activation with isothermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication, we create a method termed DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR), which achieves attomolar sensitivity for DNA detection. DETECTR enables rapid and specific detection of human papillomavirus in patient samples, thereby providing a simple platform for molecular diagnostics.</p>

Calibrated mitotic oscillator drives motile ciliogenesis
<p>Cell division and differentiation depend on massive and rapid organelle remodeling. The mitotic oscillator, centered on the cyclin-dependent kinase 1–anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (CDK1-APC/C) axis, spatiotemporally coordinates this reorganization in dividing cells. Here we discovered that nondividing cells could also implement this mitotic clocklike regulatory circuit to orchestrate subcellular reorganization associated with differentiation. We probed centriole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication in differentiating mouse-brain multiciliated cells. These postmitotic progenitors fine-tuned mitotic oscillator activity to drive the orderly progression of centriole production, maturation, and motile ciliation while avoiding the mitosis commitment threshold. Insufficient CDK1 activity hindered differentiation, whereas excessive activity accelerated differentiation yet drove postmitotic progenitors into mitosis. Thus, postmitotic cells can redeploy and calibrate the mitotic oscillator to uncouple cytoplasmic from nuclear dynamics for organelle remodeling associated with differentiation.</p>

The microbial metabolite desaminotyrosine protects from influenza through type I interferon
<p>The microbiota is known to modulate the host response to influenza infection through as-yet-unclear mechanisms. We hypothesized that components of the microbiota exert effects through type I interferon (IFN), a hypothesis supported by analysis of influenza in a gain-of-function genetic mouse model. Here we show that a microbially associated metabolite, desaminotyrosine (DAT), protects from influenza through augmentation of type I IFN signaling and diminution of lung immunopathology. A specific human-associated gut microbe, <i>Clostridium orbiscindens,</i> produced DAT and rescued antibiotic-treated influenza-infected mice. DAT protected the host by priming the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication loop of type I IFN signaling. These findings show that specific components of the enteric microbiota have distal effects on responses to lethal infections through modulation of type I IFN.</p>

Local amplifiers of IL-4Rα–mediated macrophage activation promote repair in lung and liver
<p>The type 2 immune response controls helminth infection and maintains tissue homeostasis but can lead to allergy and fibrosis if not adequately regulated. We have discovered local tissue-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>iers of type 2–mediated macrophage activation. In the lung, surfactant protein A (SP-A) enhanced interleukin-4 (IL-4)–dependent macrophage proliferation and activation, accelerating parasite clearance and reducing pulmonary injury after infection with a lung-migrating helminth. In the peritoneal cavity and liver, C1q enhancement of type 2 macrophage activation was required for liver repair after bacterial infection, but resulted in fibrosis after peritoneal dialysis. IL-4 drives production of these structurally related defense collagens, SP-A and C1q, and the expression of their receptor, myosin 18A. These findings reveal the existence within different tissues of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication system needed for local type 2 responses.</p>

Nucleic acid detection with CRISPR-Cas13a/C2c2
<p>Rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive nucleic acid detection may aid point-of-care pathogen detection, genotyping, and disease monitoring. The RNA-guided, RNA-targeting clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) effector Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) exhibits a “collateral effect” of promiscuous ribonuclease activity upon target recognition. We combine the collateral effect of Cas13a with isothermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication to establish a CRISPR-based diagnostic (CRISPR-Dx), providing rapid DNA or RNA detection with attomolar sensitivity and single-base mismatch specificity. We use this Cas13a-based molecular detection platform, termed Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK), to detect specific strains of Zika and Dengue virus, distinguish pathogenic bacteria, genotype human DNA, and identify mutations in cell-free tumor DNA. Furthermore, SHERLOCK reaction reagents can be lyophilized for cold-chain independence and long-term storage and be readily reconstituted on paper for field applications.</p>

Bug mapping and fitness testing of chemically synthesized chromosome X
<p>Debugging a genome sequence is imperative for successfully building a synthetic genome. As part of the effort to build a designer eukaryotic genome, yeast synthetic chromosome X (synX), designed as 707,459 base pairs, was synthesized chemically. SynX exhibited good fitness under a wide variety of conditions. A highly efficient mapping strategy called pooled PCRTag mapping (PoPM), which can be generalized to any watermarked synthetic chromosome, was developed to identify genetic alterations that affect cell fitness (“bugs”). A series of bugs were corrected that included a large region bearing complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ications, a growth defect mapping to a recoded sequence in <i>FIP1</i>, and a loxPsym site affecting promoter function of <i>ATP2</i>. PoPM is a powerful tool for synthetic yeast genome debugging and an efficient strategy for phenotype-genotype mapping.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
KinG Is a Plant-Specific Kinesin That Regulates Both Intra- and Intercellular Movement of SHORT-ROOT
<p>Both endogenous plant proteins and viral movement proteins associate with microtubules to promote their movement through plasmodesmata. The association of viral movement proteins with microtubules facilitates the formation of virus-associated replication complexes, which are required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication and subsequent spread of the virus. However, the role of microtubules in the intercellular movement of plant proteins is less clear. Here we show that the SHORT-ROOT (SHR) protein, which moves between cells in the root to regulate root radial patterning, interacts with a type-14 kinesin, KINESIN G (KinG). KinG is a calponin homology domain kinesin that directly interacts with the SHR-binding protein SIEL (SHR-INTERACING EMBRYONIC LETHAL) and localizes to both microtubules and actin. Since SIEL and SHR associate with endosomes, we suggest that KinG serves as a linker between SIEL, SHR, and the plant cytoskeleton. Loss of KinG function results in a decrease in the intercellular movement of SHR and an increase in the sensitivity of SHR movement to treatment with oryzalin. Examination of SHR and KinG localization and dynamics in live cells suggests that KinG is a nonmotile kinesin that promotes the pausing of SHR-associated endosomes. We suggest a model in which interaction of KinG with SHR allows for the formation of stable movement complexes that facilitate the cell-to-cell transport of SHR.</p>

Aldehyde Oxidase 4 Plays a Critical Role in Delaying Silique Senescence by Catalyzing Aldehyde Detoxification
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) aldehyde oxidases are a multigene family of four oxidases (AAO1–AAO4) that oxidize a variety of aldehydes, among them abscisic aldehyde, which is oxidized to the phytohormone abscisic acid. Toxic aldehydes are generated in plants both under normal conditions and in response to stress. The detoxification of such aldehydes by oxidation is attributed to aldehyde dehydrogenases but never to aldehyde oxidases. The feasibility of the detoxification of aldehydes in siliques via oxidation by AAO4 was demonstrated, first, by its ability to efficiently oxidize an array of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, including the reactive carbonyl species (RCS) acrolein, hydroxyl-2-nonenal, and malondialdehyde. Next, exogenous application of several aldehydes to siliques in AAO4 knockout (KO) Arabidopsis plants induced severe tissue damage and enhanced malondialdehyde levels and senescence symptoms, but not in wild-type siliques. Furthermore, abiotic stresses such as dark and ultraviolet C irradiation caused an increase in endogenous RCS and higher expression levels of senescence marker genes, leading to premature senescence of KO siliques, whereas RCS and senescence marker levels in wild-type siliques were hardly affected. Finally, in naturally senesced KO siliques, higher endogenous RCS levels were associated with enhanced senescence molecular markers, chlorophyll degradation, and earlier seed shattering compared with the wild type. The aldehyde-dependent differential generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by AAO4 and the induction of AAO4 expression by hydrogen peroxide shown here suggest a self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication mechanism for detoxifying additional reactive aldehydes produced during stress. Taken together, our results indicate that AAO4 plays a critical role in delaying senescence in siliques by catalyzing aldehyde detoxification.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
An NADPH-Oxidase/Polyamine Oxidase Feedback Loop Controls Oxidative Burst Under Salinity
<p>The apoplastic polyamine oxidase (PAO) catalyzes the oxidation of the higher polyamines spermidine and spermine, contributing to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) accumulation. However, it is yet unclear whether apoplastic PAO is part of a network that coordinates the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under salinity or if it acts independently. Here, we unravel that NADPH oxidase and apoplastic PAO cooperate to control the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxides (O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>) in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). To examine to what extent apoplastic PAO constitutes part of a ROS-generating network, we examined ROS accumulation in guard cells of plants overexpressing or down-regulating apoplastic PAO (lines S2.2 and A2, respectively) or down-regulating NADPH oxidase (line AS-<i>NtRbohD</i>/<i>F</i>). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed that, under salinity, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased in S2.2 and decreased in A2 compared with the wild type. Surprisingly, the O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-So showed that O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> levels correlated positively with that of apoplastic PAO (i.e. showed high and low levels in S2.2 and A2, respectively). By using AS-<i>NtRbohD/F</i> lines and a pharmacological approach, we could show that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> accumulation at the onset of salinity stress was dependent on NADPH oxidase, indicating that NADPH oxidase is upstream of apoplastic PAO. Our results suggest that NADPH oxidase and the apoplastic PAO form a feed-forward ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication loop, which impinges on oxidative state and culminates in the execution of programmed cell death. We propose that the PAO/NADPH oxidase loop is a central hub in the plethora of responses controlling salt stress tolerance, with potential functions extending beyond stress tolerance.</p>

The colonisation of the glenohumeral joint by <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i> is not associated with frozen shoulder but is more likely to occur after an injection into the joint
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of <i>Propionibacterium   (P.) acnes</i> in the subcutaneous fat and capsule of patients   undergoing shoulder surgery for frozen shoulder or instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients undergoing either an arthroscopic capsular   release or stabilisation had biopsies taken from the subcutaneous   fat and capsule of the shoulder at the time of surgery. These samples   were sent for culture in enrichment, and also for Nucleic Acid Amplification   testing. The prevalence of <i>P. acnes</i> and other microbes   was recorded. Fisher's exact test of binary variables was used to   calculate the association with significance set at p < 0.05.   Assessment of influence of independent variables including a pre-operative   glenohumeral injection, fat colonisation and gender, was undertaken   using binary linear regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 25 patients (53%) had <i>P. acnes</i> in   one or more tissue samples and 35 (74%) had other bacterial species.   The same microbe was found in the subcutaneous fat and the capsule   in 13 patients (28%). There was no statistically significant association   between the surgical pathology and capsular colonisation with <i>P.   acnes</i> (p = 0.18) or mixed identified bacterial species   (p = 0.77). Male gender was significantly associated with an increased   capsular colonisation of <i>P. acnes</i> (odds ratio (OR)   12.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43 to 106.77, p = 0.02). A   pre-operative glenohumeral injection was significantly associated   with capsular <i>P. acnes</i> colonisation (OR 5.63, 95%   CI 1.07 to 29.61, p = 0.04.

Artifactual mutations resulting from DNA lesions limit detection levels in ultrasensitive sequencing applications
<p>The need in cancer research or evolutionary biology to detect rare mutations or variants present at very low frequencies (<10<sup>−5</sup>) poses an increasing demand on lowering the detection limits of available methods. Here we demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>iable DNA lesions introduce important error sources in ultrasensitive technologies such as single molecule PCR (smPCR) applications (e.g. droplet-digital PCR), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) based methods. Using templates with known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>iable lesions (8-oxoguanine, deaminated 5-methylcytosine, uracil, and DNA heteroduplexes), we assessed with smPCR and duplex sequencing that templates with these lesions were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ied very efficiently by proofreading polymerases (except uracil), leading to G->T, and to a lesser extent, to unreported G->C substitutions at 8-oxoguanine lesions, and C->T transitions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ied uracil containing templates. Long heat incubations common in many DNA extraction protocols significantly increased the number of G->T substitutions. Moreover, in ∼50-80% smPCR reactions we observed the random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication preference of only one of both DNA strands explaining the known ‘PCR jackpot effect’, with the result that a lesion became indistinguishable from a true mutation or variant. Finally, we showed that artifactual mutations derived from uracil and 8-oxoguanine could be significantly reduced by DNA repair enzymes.</p>

Single-Cell Sequencing of the Healthy and Diseased Heart Reveals Cytoskeleton-Associated Protein 4 as a New Modulator of Fibroblasts Activation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Genome-wide transcriptome analysis has greatly advanced our understanding of the regulatory networks underlying basic cardiac biology and mechanisms driving disease. However, so far, the resolution of studying gene expression patterns in the adult heart has been limited to the level of extracts from whole tissues. The use of tissue homogenates inherently causes the loss of any information on cellular origin or cell type-specific changes in gene expression. Recent developments in RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication strategies provide a unique opportunity to use small amounts of input RNA for genome-wide sequencing of single cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we present a method to obtain high-quality RNA from digested cardiac tissue from adult mice for automated single-cell sequencing of both the healthy and diseased heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After optimization, we were able to perform single-cell sequencing on adult cardiac tissue under both homeostatic conditions and after ischemic injury. Clustering analysis based on differential gene expression unveiled known and novel markers of all main cardiac cell types. Based on differential gene expression, we could identify multiple subpopulations within a certain cell type. Furthermore, applying single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and injured heart indicated the presence of disease-specific cell subpopulations. As such, we identified cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 as a novel marker for activated fibroblasts that positively correlates with known myofibroblast markers in both mouse and human cardiac tissue. Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 inhibition in activated fibroblasts treated with transforming growth factor β triggered a greater increase in the expression of genes related to activated fibroblasts compared with control, suggesting a role of cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 in modulating fibroblast activation in the injured heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and diseased adult heart allows us to study transcriptomic differences between cardiac cells, as well as cell type-specific changes in gene expression during cardiac disease. This new approach provides a wealth of novel insights into molecular changes that underlie the cellular processes relevant for cardiac biology and pathophysiology. Applying this technology could lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets relevant for heart disease.</p></sec>

Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial component fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Hydroxyapatite coatings have been   applied to improve bone ingrowth in uncemented designs, but may   only coat the directly accessible surface. As peri-apatite (PA)   is solution deposited, this may increase the coverage of the implant   surface and thereby fixation. We assessed the tibial component fixation   of uncemented PA-coated TKAs <i>versus</i> cemented TKAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to PA-coated or cemented TKAs. In 60   patients (30 in each group), radiostereometric analysis of tibial   component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion was evaluated as the primary outcome at baseline,   three months post-operatively and at one, two and five years. A   linear mixed-effects model was used to analyse the repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After five years of follow-up, one (cemented) component was revised   due to ligament instability. Overall, uncemented PA-coated tibial   components <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ed significantly more    (p = 0.003), with the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) at   five years being 0.62 mm (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to   0.76) for cemented tibial components and 0.97 mm (95% CI 0.81 to   1.15) for PA-coated tibial components in TKA. However, between three   months and five years the cemented TKAs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ed significantly more   (p = 0.02), displaying a MTPM of 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.36) <i>versus</i> 0.13   mm (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.25) for PA-coated tibial components. One implant   in each group was considered at risk for aseptic loosening due to continuous   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion after five years of follow-up, albeit with different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion   patterns for each group (i.e. higher initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion but diminishing   over time for the PA-coated component <i>versus</i> gradually   increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion for the cemented component).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The tibial components of PA-coated TKAs showed more overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion   compared with the tibial components of cemented TKAs. However, <i>post   hoc</i> analysis showed that this difference was caused by   higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion of PA-coated components in the first three months,   after which a stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion pattern was observed.

Chemoattractant concentration–dependent tuning of ERK signaling dynamics in migrating neutrophils
<p>The directed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion (chemotaxis) of neutrophils toward the bacterial peptide <i>N</i>-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (<i>f</i>MLP) is a crucial process in immune defense against invading bacteria. While navigating through a gradient of increasing concentrations of <i>f</i>MLP, neutrophils and neutrophil-like HL-60 cells switch from exhibiting directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion at low <i>f</i>MLP concentrations to exhibiting circuitous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion at high <i>f</i>MLP concentrations. The extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is implicated in balancing this <i>f</i>MLP concentration–dependent switch in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion modes. We investigated the role and regulation of ERK signaling through single-cell analysis of neutrophil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion in response to different <i>f</i>MLP concentrations over time. We found that ERK exhibited gradated, rather than all-or-none, responses to <i>f</i>MLP concentration. Maximal ERK activation occurred in response to about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP, and ERK inactivation was promoted by p38. Furthermore, we found that directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion of neutrophils reached a maximal extent at about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP and that ERK, but not p38, was required for neutrophil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion. Thus, our data suggest that, in chemotactic neutrophils responding to <i>f</i>MLP, ERK displays gradated activation and p38-dependent inhibition and that these ERK dynamics promote neutrophil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion.</p>

Supracellular contractions propel migration
<p>Constructing multicellular bodies, starting from a single-cell zygote, often requires the movement of cells across considerable distances, which is achieved through cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion. During embryonic development, as well as in healing and regeneration, cells travel across diverse terrains, which dictates the character of navigation (<i>1</i>). Cancer cells metastasize and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>e into healthy organs, and knowledge of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion strategies could be important to identify targets to treat advanced disease (<i>2</i>). Some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ory cells cover large distances individually (<i>3</i>), whereas others <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>e in groups, with leaders and followers being directed by chemical signals (chemotaxis) (<i>4</i>, <i>5</i>). The exchange of information and resulting motility of such groups has been enigmatic. Moreover, the driving force of collective cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion has been considered a sum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ory and signaling activities of individually participating cells. However, according to a study on page 339 of this issue by Shellard <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>), collective cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion requires formation of cytoskeletal structures that span through adjoining cells at the rear of a cell group to coordinate, orient, and propel the entire group. This mechanism of collective cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion could be applicable to cancer metastasis and wound healing and might change our understanding of developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion.</p>

A continental system for forecasting bird migration
<p>Billions of animals cross the globe each year during seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ions, but efforts to monitor them are hampered by the unpredictability of their movements. We developed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion forecast system at a continental scale by leveraging 23 years of spring observations to identify associations between atmospheric conditions and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion intensity. Our models explained up to 81% of variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion intensity across the United States at altitudes of 0 to 3000 meters, and performance remained high in forecasting events 1 to 7 days in advance (62 to 76% of variation was explained). Avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ory movements across the United States likely exceed 500 million individuals per night during peak passage. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion forecasts will reduce collisions with buildings, airplanes, and wind turbines; inform a variety of monitoring efforts; and engage the public.</p>

Sick birds don't fly…or do they?
<p>In 2014, a new, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) called H5N8 caused outbreaks in poultry in East and Southeast Asia and spread across the Northern Hemisphere to Europe and North America. In the United States alone, H5N8 outbreaks resulted in the destruction of more than 48 million poultry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s (<i>1</i>). International live-poultry trade and wild-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion have both been implicated in the intercontinental movement of H5N8 and other HPAIVs. H5N8 viruses have been found in wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>), but strong links between poultry outbreaks and live-poultry trade or wild-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion have been elusive. On page 213 of this issue, the Global Consortium for H5N8 and Related Influenza Viruses (<i>5</i>) delineates the contributions of live-poultry trade and wild-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion to the global spread of H5N8 viruses.</p>

Synaptic transmission from subplate neurons controls radial migration of neocortical neurons
<p>The neocortex exhibits a six-layered structure that is formed by radial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion of excitatory neurons, for which the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of immature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing multipolar neurons is required. Here, we report that subplate neurons, one of the first neuron types born in the neocortex, manage the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing neurons. By histochemical, imaging, and microarray analyses on the mouse embryonic cortex, we found that subplate neurons extend neurites toward the ventricular side of the subplate and form transient glutamatergic synapses on the multipolar neurons just below the subplate. NMDAR (<i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor)–mediated synaptic transmission from subplate neurons to multipolar neurons induces the multipolar-to-bipolar transition, leading to a change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion mode from slow multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion to faster radial glial-guided locomotion. Our data suggested that transient synapses formed on early immature neurons regulate radial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion.</p>

Tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices pinch collagen fibers to support 3D cell migration
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing cells often use focal adhesions in order to move. Focal adhesions are less prominent in cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing in three-dimensional (3D) as compared with 2D environments. We looked for alternative adhesion structures supporting cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion. We analyzed the dynamics of clathrin-coated pits in cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing in a 3D environment of collagen fibers. Both topological cues and local engagement of integrins triggered the accumulation of clathrin-coated structures on fibers. Clathrin/adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) lattices pinched collagen fibers by adopting a tube-like morphology and regulated adhesion to fibers in an endocytosis-independent manner. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices stabilized cellular protrusions by providing anchoring points to collagen fibers. Thus, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices promote cell adhesion that, in coordination with focal adhesions, supports cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion in 3D.</p>

Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species
<p>Perturbed colonies of <i>Phenganax parrini</i> and <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion of symbionts of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. into the stolons. Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone). Colonies of <i>P. parrini</i>, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark, while colonies of <i>P. parrini</i> maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing symbionts in the stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P)H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation. Symbiont <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion thus correlates with dramatic physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.</p>

Laminins containing the β2 and γ3 chains regulate astrocyte migration and angiogenesis in the retina
<p>Pathologies of retinal blood vessels are among the major causes of blindness worldwide. A key cell type that regulates retinal vascular development is the astrocyte. Generated extrinsically to the retina, astrocytes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>e into the retina through the optic nerve head. Even though there is a strong correlation between astrocyte distribution and retinal vascular development, the factors that guide astrocytes into the retina remain unclear. In this study, we show that astrocytes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>e within a laminin-containing basement membrane - the inner limiting membrane. Genetic deletion of the laminin β2 and γ3 chains affects astrocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and spatial distribution. We show that laminins act as haptotactic factors <i>in vitro</i> in an isoform-specific manner, inducing astrocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and promoting astrocyte differentiation. The addition of exogenous laminins to laminin-null retinal explants rescues astrocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and spatial patterning. Furthermore, we show that the loss of laminins reduces β1 integrin expression in astrocytes. Culturing laminin-null retinal astrocytes on laminin substrates restores focal localization of β1 integrin. Finally, we show that laminins containing β2 and γ3 chains regulate subsequent retinal blood vessel growth and maintain vascular integrity. These <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> studies demonstrate clearly that laminins containing β2 and γ3 chains are indispensable for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and spatial organization of astrocytes and that they play a crucial role during retinal angiogenesis <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

A Cytokine-Like Protein Dickkopf-Related Protein 3 Is Atheroprotective
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3) is a secreted protein that is involved in the regulation of cardiac remodeling and vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation, but little is known about its role in atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that DKK3 is atheroprotective using both epidemiological and experimental approaches. Blood DKK3 levels were measured in the Bruneck Study in 2000 (n=684) and then in 2005 (n=574). <i>DKK3</i>-deficient mice were crossed with <i>apolipoprotein E</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice to evaluate atherosclerosis development and vessel injury-induced neointimal formation.

A SAP domain-containing protein shuttles between the nucleus and cell membranes and plays a role in adhesion and migration in <i>D. discoideum</i>
<p>The AmpA protein reduces cell adhesion, thereby influencing cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. To understand how <i>ampA</i> influences cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion, second site suppressors of an AmpA overexpressing cell line were created by REMI mutagenesis. Mutant candidates were identified by their ability to suppress the large plaques that the AmpA overexpressing cells form on bacterial lawns as a result of their increased rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion. One suppressor gene, <i>sma</i>, encodes an uncharacterized protein, which contains a SAP DNA-binding domain and a PTEN-like domain. Using <i>sma</i> gene knockouts and Sma-mRFP expressing cell lines, a role for <i>sma</i> in influencing cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion was uncovered. Knockouts of the <i>sma</i> gene in a wild-type background enhanced chemotaxis. An additional role for Sma in influencing cell–cell adhesion was also demonstrated. Sma protein transitions between cytosolic and nuclear localizations as a function of cell density. In growing cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing to folic acid it is localized to regions of actin polymerization and absent from the nucleus. A role for Sma in influencing <i>ampA</i> mRNA levels is also demonstrated. Sma additionally appears to be involved in <i>ampA</i> pathways regulating cell size, actin polymerization, and cell substrate adhesion. We present insights to the SAP domain-containing group of proteins in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and provide evidence of a role for a SAP domain-containing protein shuttling from the nucleus to sites of actin polymerization during chemotaxis to folic acid and influencing the efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion.</p>

Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p>Cell motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and cancer cell invasion. It is generally thought that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing cells grab and exert traction force onto the extracellular matrix in order to pull the cell body forward. While previous studies have shown that myosin II deficient cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>e efficiently, whether these cells exert traction forces during cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a force sensor and shRNA specific to each myosin II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how myosin IIA and IIB individually regulate cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and traction force generation. Myosin IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction force was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively.

Interestingly, myosin IIA deficient cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ed faster than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet myosin IIA deficient cells exerted significantly less traction force at the leading edge than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells.

New bird flu strain brings death and questions
<p>The avian influenza strain H5N8 has spread from Asia to many countries in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, infecting both wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s and poultry; hundreds of thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s have been culled to halt the epidemic. H5N8 is a distant descendant of the H5N1 virus that devastated flocks across much of the world and killed hundreds of people more than a decade ago. The good news is that so far, it does not seem to infect humans. But its rapid spread and increasing deadliness to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s have mystified experts. And it underscores that avian influenza, once an occasional crisis, is now endemic in the burgeoning flocks of Asia, from which it periodically spreads in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

CD13 tethers the IQGAP1-ARF6-EFA6 complex to the plasma membrane to promote ARF6 activation, β1 integrin recycling, and cell migration
<p>Cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) requires a balance between integrin internalization and recycling to the surface that is mediated by numerous proteins, emphasizing the complexity of these processes. Upon ligand binding in various cells, the β1 integrin is internalized, traffics to early endosomes, and is returned to the plasma membrane through recycling endosomes. This trafficking process depends on the cyclical activation and inactivation of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) by their specific guanine exchange factors (GEFs) and their GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). In this study, we found that the cell surface antigen CD13, a multifunctional transmembrane molecule that regulates cell-cell adhesion and receptor-mediated endocytosis, also promoted cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and colocalized with β1 integrin at sites of cell adhesion and at the leading edge. A lack of CD13 resulted in aberrant trafficking of internalized β1 integrin to late endosomes and its ultimate degradation. Our data indicate that CD13 promoted ARF6 GTPase activity by positioning the ARF6-GEF EFA6 at the cell membrane. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing cells, a complex containing phosphorylated CD13, IQGAP1, GTP-bound (active) ARF6, and EFA6 at the leading edge promoted the ARF6 GTPase cycling and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion. Together, our findings uncover a role for CD13 in the fundamental cellular processes of receptor recycling, regulation of small GTPase activities, cell-ECM interactions, and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion.</p>

TGF-β receptor I/II trafficking and signaling at primary cilia are inhibited by ceramide to attenuate cell migration and tumor metastasis
<p>Signaling by the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) receptors I and II (TβRI/II) and the primary cilia-localized sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway promote cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and, consequently, tumor metastasis. In contrast, the sphingolipid ceramide inhibits cell proliferation and tumor metastasis. We investigated whether ceramide metabolism inhibited TβRI/II trafficking to primary cilia to attenuate cross-talk between TβRI/II and the Shh pathway. We found that ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4)–generated ceramide stabilized the association between TβRI and the inhibitory factor Smad7, which limited the trafficking of TβRI/II to primary cilia. Expression of a mutant TβRI that signals but does not interact with Smad7 prevented the CerS4-mediated inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion in various cancer cells. Genetic deletion or knockdown of CerS4 prevented the formation of the Smad7-TβRI inhibitory complex and increased the association between TβRI and the transporter Arl6 through a previously unknown cilia-targeting signal (Ala<sup>31</sup>Thr<sup>32</sup>Ala<sup>33</sup>Leu<sup>34</sup>Gln<sup>35</sup>) in TβRI. Mutating the cilia-targeting signal abolished the trafficking of TβRI to the primary cilia. Localization of TβRI to primary cilia activated a key mediator of Shh signaling, Smoothened (Smo), which stimulated cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and invasion. TβRI-Smo cross-talk at the cilia in CerS4-deficient 4T1 mammary cancer cells induced liver metastasis from orthotopic allografts in both wild-type and CerS4-deficient mice, which was prevented by overexpression of Smad7 or knockdown of intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88). Overall, these data reveal a ceramide-dependent mechanism that suppresses cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and invasion by restricting TβRI/II-Shh signaling selectively at the plasma membrane of the primary cilium.</p>

Is ungulate migration culturally transmitted? Evidence of social learning from translocated animals
<p>Ungulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ions are assumed to stem from learning and cultural transmission of information regarding seasonal distribution of forage, but this hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We compared the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ory propensities of bighorn sheep and moose translocated into novel habitats with those of historical populations that had persisted for hundreds of years. Whereas individuals from historical populations were largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ory, translocated individuals initially were not. After multiple decades, however, translocated populations gained knowledge about surfing green waves of forage (tracking plant phenology) and increased their propensity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>e. Our findings indicate that learning and cultural transmission are the primary mechanisms by which ungulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ions evolve. Loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion will therefore expunge generations of knowledge about the locations of high-quality forage and likely suppress population abundance.</p>

From local collective behavior to global migratory patterns in white storks
<p>Soaring migrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s exploit columns of rising air (thermals) to cover large distances with minimal energy.

We investigated the group movements of a flock of 27 naturally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing juvenile white storks by using high-resolution GPS and accelerometers. Analyzing individual and group movements on multiple scales revealed that a small number of leaders navigated to and explored thermals, whereas followers benefited from their movements.

Followers also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ed less far annually than did leaders.

Ancient DNA reveals elephant birds and kiwi are sister taxa and clarifies ratite bird evolution
<p>The evolution of the ratite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s has been widely attributed to vicariant speciation, driven by the Cretaceous breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. The early isolation of Africa and Madagascar implies that the ostrich and extinct Madagascan elephant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s (Aepyornithidae) should be the oldest ratite lineages. We sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of two elephant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s and performed phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s are the closest relatives of the New Zealand kiwi and are distant from the basal ratite lineage of ostriches. This unexpected result strongly contradicts continental vicariance and instead supports flighted dispersal in all major ratite lineages. We suggest that convergence toward gigantism and flightlessness was facilitated by early Tertiary expansion into the diurnal herbivory niche after the extinction of the dinosaurs.</p>

Auxin and ROP GTPase Signaling of Polar Nuclear Migration in Root Epidermal Hair Cells
<p>Polar nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion is crucial during the development of diverse eukaryotes. In plants, root hair growth requires polar nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion into the outgrowing hair. However, knowledge about the dynamics and the regulatory mechanisms underlying nuclear movements in root epidermal cells remains limited. Here, we show that both auxin and Rho-of-Plant (ROP) signaling modulate polar nuclear position at the inner epidermal plasma membrane domain oriented to the cortical cells during cell elongation as well as subsequent polar nuclear movement to the outer domain into the emerging hair bulge in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Auxin signaling via the nuclear AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE ACETIC ACID7 pathway ensures correct nuclear placement toward the inner membrane domain. Moreover, precise inner nuclear placement relies on SPIKE1 Rho-GEF, SUPERCENTIPEDE1 Rho-GDI, and ACTIN7 (ACT7) function and to a lesser extent on VTI11 vacuolar SNARE activity. Strikingly, the directionality and/or velocity of outer polar nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion into the hair outgrowth along actin strands also are ACT7 dependent, auxin sensitive, and regulated by ROP signaling. Thus, our findings provide a founding framework revealing auxin and ROP signaling of inner polar nuclear position with some contribution by vacuolar morphology and of actin-dependent outer polar nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion in root epidermal hair cells.</p>

Biased agonists of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 differentially control chemotaxis and inflammation
<p>The chemokine receptor CXCR3 plays a central role in inflammation by mediating effector/memory T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion in various diseases; however, drugs targeting CXCR3 and other chemokine receptors are largely ineffective in treating inflammation. Chemokines, the endogenous peptide ligands of chemokine receptors, can exhibit so-called biased agonism by selectively activating either G protein– or β-arrestin–mediated signaling after receptor binding. Biased agonists might be used as more targeted therapeutics to differentially regulate physiological responses, such as immune cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion. To test whether CXCR3-mediated physiological responses could be segregated by G protein– and β-arrestin–mediated signaling, we identified and characterized small-molecule biased agonists of the receptor. In a mouse model of T cell–mediated allergic contact hypersensitivity (CHS), topical application of a β-arrestin–biased, but not a G protein–biased, agonist potentiated inflammation. T cell recruitment was increased by the β-arrestin–biased agonist, and biopsies of patients with allergic CHS demonstrated coexpression of CXCR3 and β-arrestin in T cells. In mouse and human T cells, the β-arrestin–biased agonist was the most efficient at stimulating chemotaxis. Analysis of phosphorylated proteins in human lymphocytes showed that β-arrestin–biased signaling activated the kinase Akt, which promoted T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion. This study demonstrates that biased agonists of CXCR3 produce distinct physiological effects, suggesting discrete roles for different endogenous CXCR3 ligands and providing evidence that biased signaling can affect the clinical utility of drugs targeting CXCR3 and other chemokine receptors.</p>

Stepwise phosphorylation of leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> receptor 1 defines cellular responses to leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>
<p>Leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>) receptor type 1 (BLT1) is abundant in phagocytic and immune cells and plays crucial roles in various inflammatory diseases. BLT1 is phosphorylated at several serine and threonine residues upon stimulation with the inflammatory lipid LTB<sub>4</sub>. Using Phos-tag gel electrophoresis to separate differentially phosphorylated forms of BLT1, we identified two distinct types of phosphorylation, basal and ligand-induced, in the carboxyl terminus of human BLT1. In the absence of LTB<sub>4</sub>, the basal phosphorylation sites were modified to various degrees, giving rise to many different phosphorylated forms of BLT1. Different concentrations of LTB<sub>4</sub> induced distinct phosphorylation events, and these ligand-induced modifications facilitated additional phosphorylation events at the basal phosphorylation sites. Because neutrophils <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>e toward inflammatory sites along a gradient of LTB<sub>4</sub>, the degree of BLT1 phosphorylation likely increases in parallel with the increase in LTB<sub>4</sub> concentration as the cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>e. At high concentrations of LTB<sub>4</sub>, deficiencies in these two types of phosphorylation events impaired chemotaxis and β-hexosaminidase release, a proxy for degranulation, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, respectively. These results suggest that an LTB<sub>4</sub> gradient around inflammatory sites enhances BLT1 phosphorylation in a stepwise manner to facilitate the precise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion of phagocytic and immune cells and the initiation of local responses, including degranulation.</p>

Contact inhibitory Eph signaling suppresses EGF-promoted cell migration by decoupling EGFR activity from vesicular recycling
<p>The ability of cells to adapt their response to growth factors in relation to their environment is an essential aspect of tissue development and homeostasis. We found that signaling mediated by the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases from cell-cell contacts changed the cellular response to the growth factor EGF by modulating the vesicular trafficking of its receptor, EGFR. Eph receptor activation trapped EGFR in Rab5-positive early endosomes by inhibiting Akt-dependent vesicular recycling. By altering the spatial distribution of EGFR activity, EGF-promoted Akt signaling from the plasma membrane was suppressed, thereby inhibiting cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion. In contrast, ERK signaling from endosomal EGFR was preserved to maintain a proliferative response to EGF stimulation. We also found that soluble extracellular signals engaging the G protein–coupled receptor Kiss1 (Kiss1R) similarly suppressed EGFR vesicular recycling to inhibit EGF-promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion. Eph or Kiss1R activation also suppressed EGF-promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion in <i>Pten</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which exhibit increased constitutive Akt activity, and in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells, which overexpress EGFR. The cellular environment can thus generate context-dependent responses to EGF stimulation by modulating EGFR vesicular trafficking dynamics.</p>

Wdpcp promotes epicardial EMT and epicardium-derived cell migration to facilitate coronary artery remodeling
<p>During coronary vasculature development, endothelial cells enclose the embryonic heart to form the primitive coronary plexus. This structure is remodeled upon recruitment of epicardial cells that may undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and that give rise to smooth muscle cells. In mice expressing a loss-of-function mutant form of <i>Wdpcp</i>, a gene involved in ciliogenesis, the enclosure of the surface of the heart by the subepicardial coronary plexus was accelerated because of enhanced chemotactic responses to Shh. Coronary arteries, but not coronary veins in <i>Wdpcp</i> mutant mice, showed reduced smooth muscle cell coverage. In addition, <i>Wdpcp</i> mutant hearts had reduced expression of EMT and mesenchymal markers and had fewer epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs) that showed impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion. Epicardium-specific deletion of <i>Wdpcp</i> recapitulated the coronary artery defect of the <i>Wdpcp</i> mutant.

RhoB controls the Rab11-mediated recycling and surface reappearance of LFA-1 in migrating T lymphocytes
<p>The regulation of cell adhesion and motility is complex and requires the intracellular trafficking of integrins to and from sites of cell adhesion, especially in fast-moving cells such as leukocytes. The Rab family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) is essential for vesicle transport, and vesicles mediate intracellular integrin trafficking. We showed that RhoB regulates the vesicular transport of the integrin LFA-1 along the microtubule network in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing T lymphocytes. Impairment in RhoB function resulted in the accumulation of both LFA-1 and the recycling endosomal marker Rab11 at the rear of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing T lymphocytes and decreased the association between these molecules. T lymphocytes lacking functional RhoB exhibited impaired recycling and subsequently decreased surface amounts of LFA-1, leading to reduced T cell adhesion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion mediated by the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule–1). We propose that vesicle-associated RhoB is a regulator of the Rab11-mediated recycling of LFA-1 to the cell surface, an event that is necessary for T lymphocyte motility.</p>

ATP promotes the fast migration of dendritic cells through the activity of pannexin 1 channels and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors
<p>Upon its release from injured cells, such as infected, transformed, inflamed, or necrotic cells, extracellular adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) acts as a danger signal that recruits phagocytes, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), to the site of injury. The sensing of extracellular ATP occurs through purinergic (P2) receptors. We investigated the cellular mechanisms linking purinergic signaling to DC motility. We found that ATP stimulated fast DC motility through an autocrine signaling loop, which was initiated by the activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and further amplified by pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels. Upon stimulation of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor by ATP, Panx1 contributed to fast DC motility by increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane, which resulted in supplementary ATP release. In the absence of Panx1, DCs failed to increase their speed of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion in response to ATP, despite exhibiting a normal P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. In addition to DC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion, Panx1 channel– and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–dependent signaling was further required to stimulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In vivo, functional Panx1 channels were required for the homing of DCs to lymph nodes, although they were dispensable for DC maturation. These data suggest that P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and Panx1 channels are crucial players in the regulation of DC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion to endogenous danger signals.</p>

Genome-wide functional analysis reveals central signaling regulators of lymphatic endothelial cell migration and remodeling
<p>Lymphatic vessels constitute a specialized vasculature that is involved in development, cancer, obesity, and immune regulation. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) is critical for vessel growth (lymphangiogenesis) and vessel remodeling, processes that modify the lymphatic network in response to developmental or pathological demands. Using the publicly accessible results of our genome-wide siRNA screen, we characterized the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ome of primary human LECs and identified individual genes and signaling pathways that regulate LEC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion. We compared our data set with mRNA differential expression data from endothelial and stromal cells derived from two in vivo models of lymphatic vessel remodeling, viral infection and contact hypersensitivity–induced inflammation, which identified genes selectively involved in regulating LEC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and remodeling. We also characterized the top candidates in the LEC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ome in primary blood vascular endothelial cells to identify genes with functions common to lymphatic and blood vascular endothelium. On the basis of these analyses, we showed that <i>LGALS1</i>, which encodes the glycan-binding protein Galectin-1, promoted lymphatic vascular growth in vitro and in vivo and contributed to maintenance of the lymphatic endothelial phenotype. Our results provide insight into the signaling networks that control lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic remodeling and potentially identify therapeutic targets and biomarkers in disease specific to lymphatic or blood vessels.</p>

Strategies to sustainably manage wild meat hunting in both protected and unprotected tropical ecosystems are urgently needed to avoid further defaunation.</p>

The diagnostic performance of radiographic criteria to detect aseptic acetabular component loosening after revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of radiographic   criteria to detect aseptic acetabular loosening after revision total   hip arthroplasty (THA). Secondary aims were to determine the predictive   values of different thresholds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and to determine the   predictive values of radiolucency criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Acetabular component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion to re-revision was measured retrospectively   using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup) and manual measurements   (Sutherland method) in two groups: Group A, 52 components (48 patients) found   not loose at re-revision and Group B, 42 components (36 patients)   found loose at re-revision between 1980 and 2015. The presence and   extent of radiolucent lines was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using EBRA, both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were   excellent diagnostic tests for detecting aseptic loosening. The   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was   0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The thresholds of 2.5 mm proximal translation   or 2° sagittal rotation (EBRA) in combination with radiolucency   criteria had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88% to detect   aseptic loosening. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive   value and negative predictive value (NPV) of radiolucency criteria   were 41%, 100%, 100% and 68% respectively. Manual measurements of   both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were very good diagnostic tests.   The area under the ROC curve was 0.86 and 0.92 respectively. However,   manual measurements had a decreased specificity compared with EBRA.   Radiolucency criteria had a poor sensitivity and NPV of 41% and   68% respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that EBRA and manual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion measurements   can be used as accurate diagnostic tools to detect aseptic loosening   of cementless acetabular components used at revision THA. Radiolucency   criteria should not be used in isolation to exclude loosening of   cementless acetabular components used at revision THA given their poor   sensitivity and NPV.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:458–64.</p></sec>

Hemiarthroplasty proximal femoral endoprostheses following tumour reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Dislocation rates are reportedly lower in patients requiring   proximal femoral hemiarthroplasty than for patients undergoing hip   arthroplasty for neoplasia. Without acetabular replacement, pain   due to acetabular wear necessitating revision surgery has been described.   We aimed to determine whether wear of the native acetabulum following   hemiarthroplasty necessitates revision surgery with secondary replacement   of the acetabulum after proximal femoral replacement (PFR) for tumour   reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 100 consecutive PFRs performed between January 2003   and January 2013 without acetabular resurfacing. The procedure was   undertaken in 74 patients with metastases, for a primary bone tumour   in 20 and for myeloma in six. There were 48 male and 52 female patients,   with a mean age of 61.4 years (19 to 85) and median follow-up of   two years (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5 to 3.7 years). In total,   52 patients presented with a pathological fracture and six presented   with failed fixation of a previously instrumented pathological fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All patients underwent reconstruction with either a unipolar   (n = 64) or bipolar (n = 36) articulation. There were no dislocations   and no acetabular resurfacings. Articular wear was graded using   the criteria of Baker et al from 0 to 3, where by 0 is normal; grade   1 represents a narrowing of articular cartilage and no bone erosion;   grade 2 represents acetabular bone erosion and early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion;   and grade 3 represents protrusio acetabuli. Of the 49 patients with radiological   follow-up greater than one year, six demonstrated grade 1 acetabular   wear and two demonstrated grade 2 acetabular wear. The remainder   demonstrated no radiographic evidence of wear. Median medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion was   0.3 mm (IQR -0.2 to 0.7) and superior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion was 0.3 mm (IQR   -0.2 to 0.6). No relationship between unipolar <i>versus</i> bipolar   articulations and wear was evident.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Hemiarthroplasty PFRs for tumour reconstruction eliminate joint   instability and, in the short to medium term, do not lead to native   acetabular wear necessitating later acetabular resurfacing.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100B:101–8.</p></sec>

Role of En2 in the tectal laminar formation of chick embryos
<p>The chick optic tectum consists of 16 laminae. Here, we report contribution of En2 to laminar formation in chick optic tecta. En2 is specifically expressed in laminae g-j of stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale (SGFS). Misexpression of En2 resulted in disappearance of En2-expressing cells from the superficial layers (laminae a-f of SGFS), where endogenous En2 is not expressed. Misexpression of En2 before postmitotic cells had left the ventricular layer indicated that En2-misexpressing cells stopped at the laminae of endogenous En2 expression and that they did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>e into the superficial layers. Induction of En2 misexpression using a tetracycline-inducible system after the postmitotic cells had reached superficial layers also resulted in disappearance of En2-expressing cells from the superficial layers. Time-lapse analysis showed that En2-misexpressing cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ed back from the superficial layers towards the middle layers, where En2 is strongly expressed endogenously. Our results suggest a potential role of En2 in regulating cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and positioning in the tectal laminar formation.</p>

The secreted <i>AdamTS-A</i> metalloprotease is required for collective cell migration
<p>Members of the ADAMTS family of secreted metalloproteases play crucial roles in modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) in development and disease. Here, we show that ADAMTS-A, the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of human ADAMTS 9 and ADAMTS 20, and of <i>C. elegans</i> GON-1, is required for cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion during embryogenesis. <i>AdamTS-A</i> is expressed in multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ory cell types, including hemocytes, caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM), the visceral branch of the trachea (VBs) and the secretory portion of the salivary gland (SG). Loss of <i>AdamTS-A</i> causes defects in germ cell, CVM and VB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion and, depending on the tissue, <i>AdamTS-A</i> functions both autonomously and non-autonomously. In the highly polarized collective of the SG epithelium, loss of <i>AdamTS-A</i> causes apical surface irregularities and cell elongation defects. We provide evidence that ADAMTS-A is secreted into the SG lumen where it functions to release cells from the apical ECM, consistent with the defects observed in <i>AdamTS-A</i> mutant SGs. We show that loss of the apically localized protocadherin <i>Cad99C</i> rescues the SG defects, suggesting that Cad99C serves as a link between the SG apical membrane and the secreted apical ECM component(s) cleaved by ADAMTS-A. Our analysis of <i>AdamTS-A</i> function in the SG suggests a novel role for ADAMTS proteins in detaching cells from the apical ECM, facilitating tube elongation during collective cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion.</p>

Migration of <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal stem cells across organ boundaries
<p>All components of the <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal tract, including the endodermal midgut and ectodermal hindgut/Malpighian tubules, maintain populations of dividing stem cells. In the midgut and hindgut, these stem cells originate from within larger populations of intestinal progenitors that proliferate during the larval stage and form the adult intestine during metamorphosis. The origin of stem cells found in the excretory Malpighian tubules (‘renal stem cells’) has not been established. In this paper, we investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion patterns of intestinal progenitors that take place during metamorphosis. Our data demonstrate that a subset of adult midgut progenitors (AMPs) move posteriorly to form the adult ureters and, consecutively, the renal stem cells. Inhibiting cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion by AMP-directed expression of a dominant-negative form of Rac1 protein results in the absence of stem cells in the Malpighian tubules. As the majority of the hindgut progenitor cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>e posteriorly and differentiate into hindgut enterocytes, a group of the progenitor cells, unexpectedly, invades anteriorly into the midgut territory. Consequently, these progenitor cells differentiate into midgut enterocytes. The midgut determinant <i>GATAe</i> is required for the differentiation of midgut enterocytes derived from hindgut progenitors. Wingless signaling acts to balance the proportion of hindgut progenitors that differentiate as midgut versus hindgut enterocytes. Our findings indicate that a stable boundary between midgut and hindgut/Malpighian tubules is not established during early embryonic development; instead, pluripotent progenitor populations cross in between these organs in both directions, and are able to adopt the fate of the organ in which they come to reside.</p>

Long-range hot-carrier transport in hybrid perovskites visualized by ultrafast microscopy
<p>The Shockley-Queisser limit for solar cell efficiency can be overcome if hot carriers can be harvested before they thermalize. Recently, carrier cooling time up to 100 picoseconds was observed in hybrid perovskites, but it is unclear whether these long-lived hot carriers can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>e long distance for efficient collection. We report direct visualization of hot-carrier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion in methylammonium lead iodide (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>) thin films by ultrafast transient absorption microscopy, demonstrating three distinct transport regimes. Quasiballistic transport was observed to correlate with excess kinetic energy, resulting in up to 230 nanometers transport distance that could overcome grain boundaries. The nonequilibrium transport persisted over tens of picoseconds and ~600 nanometers before reaching the diffusive transport limit. These results suggest potential applications of hot-carrier devices based on hybrid perovskites.</p>

Mass seasonal bioflows of high-flying insect migrants
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ing animals have an impact on ecosystems directly via influxes of predators, prey, and competitors and indirectly by vectoring nutrients, energy, and pathogens. Although linkages between vertebrate movements and ecosystem processes have been established, the effects of mass insect “bioflows” have not been described. We quantified biomass flux over the southern United Kingdom for high-flying (>150 meters) insects and show that ~3.5 trillion insects (3200 tons of biomass) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>e above the region annually. These flows are not randomly directed in insects larger than 10 milligrams, which exploit seasonally beneficial tailwinds. Large seasonal differences in the southward versus northward transfer of biomass occur in some years, although flows were balanced over the 10-year period. Our long-term study reveals a major transport process with implications for ecosystem services, processes, and biogeochemistry.</p>

Encoding vocal culture
<p>How does an inexperienced young animal acquire proper communication skills that will serve it well as an adult in a complex social environment? Juvenile song<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s acquire their vocal repertoire by imitating songs from adults. But song imitation per se is not the ultimate goal of their vocal development (<i>1</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>song may carry information about species identity, group identity (local culture), individual identity, and—perhaps most important—about a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>'s qualities as a potential mate (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). There is some tension between these developmental goals: Because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s can imitate songs very accurately, local song convergence could compromise individual identity. Similarly, the accumulation of geographical drifts in song structure could potentially compromise the species-specific “signature” of the song. On pages 1278 and 1282 of this issue, Gadagkar <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) and Araki <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>), respectively, discover neuronal coding of singing performance error and of species song identity. Together, their findings reveal an elegant natural solution that alleviates the tension between cultural transmission and retaining a species-specific “signature” in songs over generations.</p>

Role for migratory wild birds in the global spread of avian influenza H5N8
<p>Avian influenza viruses affect both poultry production and public health. A subtype H5N8 (clade 2.3.4.4) virus, following an outbreak in poultry in South Korea in January 2014, rapidly spread worldwide in 2014–2015. Our analysis of H5N8 viral sequences, epidemiological investigations, waterfowl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion, and poultry trade showed that long-distance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s can play a major role in the global spread of avian influenza viruses. Further, we found that the hemagglutinin of clade 2.3.4.4 virus was remarkably promiscuous, creating reassortants with multiple neuraminidase subtypes. Improving our understanding of the circumpolar circulation of avian influenza viruses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ory waterfowl will help to provide early warning of threats from avian influenza to poultry, and potentially human, health.</p>

Extensive migration of young neurons into the infant human frontal lobe
<p>The first few months after birth, when a child begins to interact with the environment, are critical to human brain development. The human frontal lobe is important for social behavior and executive function; it has increased in size and complexity relative to other species, but the processes that have contributed to this expansion are unknown. Our studies of postmortem infant human brains revealed a collection of neurons that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>e and integrate widely into the frontal lobe during infancy. Chains of young neurons move tangentially close to the walls of the lateral ventricles and along blood vessels. These cells then individually disperse long distances to reach cortical tissue, where they differentiate and contribute to inhibitory circuits. Late-arriving interneurons could contribute to developmental plasticity, and the disruption of their postnatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">migrat</span></strong>ion or differentiation may underlie neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

Deception by Flexible Alarm Mimicry in an African Bird
<sec><title>Trick and Treat</title><p>Forked-tailed drongos are a particularly intelligent type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> found in Africa. Drongos associate with many other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> and mammal species, which can learn to respond to drongo warning calls. Drongos are also exceptional mimics of the other species' alarm calls. Though the increased vigilance across these multi species associations is a benefit to all, drongos sometimes use these calls as ploys to scare associated species away from food, which the drongos then steal. However, without some approach to maintain the effectiveness of this deception, the drongos' ploy would soon be detected. <bold>Flower <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 513) now show that drongos are able to fool their target species longer by flexibly varying the type of call they give.</p></sec>

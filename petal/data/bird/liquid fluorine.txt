Fluorine-programmed nanozipping to tailored nanographenes on rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces
<p>The rational synthesis of nanographenes and carbon nanoribbons directly on nonmetallic surfaces has been an elusive goal for a long time. We report that activation of the carbon (C)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>e (F) bond is a reliable and versatile tool enabling intramolecular aryl-aryl coupling directly on metal oxide surfaces. A challenging multistep transformation enabled by C–F bond activation led to a dominolike coupling that yielded tailored nanographenes directly on the rutile titania surface. Because of efficient regioselective zipping, we obtained the target nanographenes from flexible precursors. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>e positions in the precursor structure unambiguously dictated the running of the “zipping program,” resulting in the rolling up of oligophenylene chains. The high efficiency of the hydrogen fluoride zipping makes our approach attractive for the rational synthesis of nanographenes and nanoribbons directly on insulating and semiconducting surfaces.</p>

Deconstructive fluorination of cyclic amines by carbon-carbon cleavage
<p>Deconstructive functionalizations involving scission of carbon-carbon double bonds are well established. In contrast, unstrained C(sp<sup>3</sup>)–C(sp<sup>3</sup>) bond cleavage and functionalization have less precedent. Here we report the use of deconstructive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ation to access mono- and di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ated amine derivatives by C(sp<sup>3</sup>)–C(sp<sup>3</sup>) bond cleavage in saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as piperidines and pyrrolidines. Silver-mediated ring-opening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ation using Selectfluor highlights a strategy for cyclic amine functionalization and late-stage skeletal diversification, establishing cyclic amines as synthons for amino alkyl radicals and providing synthetic routes to valuable building blocks.</p>

Modular radical cross-coupling with sulfones enables access to sp<sup>3</sup>-rich (fluoro)alkylated scaffolds
<p>Cross-coupling chemistry is widely applied to carbon-carbon bond formation in the synthesis of medicines, agrochemicals, and other functional materials. Recently, single-electron–induced variants of this reaction class have proven particularly useful in the formation of C(sp<sup>2</sup>)–C(sp<sup>3</sup>) linkages, although certain compound classes have remained a challenge. Here, we report the use of sulfones to activate the alkyl coupling partner in nickel-catalyzed radical cross-coupling with aryl zinc reagents. This method’s tolerance of fluoroalkyl substituents proved particularly advantageous for the streamlined preparation of pharmaceutically oriented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ated scaffolds that previously required multiple steps, toxic reagents, and nonmodular retrosynthetic blueprints. Five specific sulfone reagents facilitate the rapid assembly of a vast set of compounds, many of which contain challenging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ation patterns.</p>

Hydrogenation of fluoroarenes: Direct access to all-<i>cis</i>-(multi)fluorinated cycloalkanes
<p>All-c<i>is</i>-multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ated cycloalkanes exhibit intriguing electronic properties. In particular, they display extremely high dipole moments perpendicular to the aliphatic ring, making them highly desired motifs in material science. Very few such motifs have been prepared, as their syntheses require multistep sequences from diastereoselectively prefunctionalized precursors. Herein we report a synthetic strategy to access these valuable materials via the rhodium–cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)–catalyzed hydrogenation of readily available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ated arenes in hexane. This route enables the scalable single-step preparation of an abundance of multisubstituted and multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ated cycloalkanes, including all-<i>cis</i>-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane as well as cis-configured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ated aliphatic heterocycles.</p>

Hydrolytically stable fluorinated metal-organic frameworks for energy-efficient dehydration
<p>Natural gas must be dehydrated before it can be transported and used, but conventional drying agents such as activated alumina or inorganic molecular sieves require an energy-intensive desiccant-regeneration step. We report a hydrolytically stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ated metal-organic framework, AlFFIVE-1-Ni (KAUST-8), with a periodic array of open metal coordination sites and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>e moieties within the contracted square-shaped one-dimensional channel. This material selectively removed water vapor from gas streams containing CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and higher hydrocarbons typical of natural gas, as well as selectively removed both H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> in N<sub>2</sub>-containing streams. The complete desorption of the adsorbed water molecules contained by the AlFFIVE-1-Ni sorbent requires relatively moderate temperature (~105°C) and about half the energy input for commonly used desiccants.</p>

Evidence for a Symmetrical Fluoronium Ion in Solution
<sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>e Learns to Share</title><p>Though halides typically coordinate to just one carbon center, their transient coordination to a second carbon (forming a positively charged bridge) explains the spatial dynamics of many reactions. However, unlike chlorine, bromine, and iodine—which can all form such halonium ions—<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>e does not appear to engage in carbon-bridging behavior, presumably because of its very high electronegativity. <bold>Struble <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 57, see the Perspective by <bold>Hennecke</bold>) synthesized a rigid molecule, particularly well-poised to manifest fluoride bridging, and provide evidence for a fluoronium intermediate in a displacement reaction.</p></sec>

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride ion batteries are potential “next-generation” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operation at high temperatures because suitable fluoride ion–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride ion–conducting electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper–lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF<sub>3</sub>) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ation and de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ation reactions in a fluoride ion electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature. Fluoride ion–mediated electrochemistry offers a pathway toward developing capacities beyond that of lithium ion technology.</p>

Asymmetric nucleophilic fluorination under hydrogen bonding phase-transfer catalysis
<p>Common anionic nucleophiles such as those derived from inorganic salts have not been used for enantioselective catalysis because of their insolubility. Here, we report that merging hydrogen bonding and phase-transfer catalysis provides an effective mode of activation for nucleophiles that are insoluble in organic solvents. This catalytic manifold relies on hydrogen bonding complexation to render nucleophiles soluble and reactive, while simultaneously inducing asymmetry in the ensuing transformation. We demonstrate the concept using a chiral bis-urea catalyst to form a tridentate hydrogen bonding complex with fluoride from its cesium salt, thereby enabling highly efficient enantioselective ring opening of episulfonium ion. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ation method is synthetically valuable considering the scarcity of alternative protocols and points the way to wider application of the catalytic approach with diverse anionic nucleophiles.</p>

Posttranslational mutagenesis: A chemical strategy for exploring protein side-chain diversity
<p>Posttranslational modification of proteins expands their structural and functional capabilities beyond those directly specified by the genetic code. However, the vast diversity of chemically plausible (including unnatural but functionally relevant) side chains is not readily accessible. We describe C (sp<sup>3</sup>)–C (sp<sup>3</sup>) bond-forming reactions on proteins under biocompatible conditions, which exploit unusual carbon free-radical chemistry, and use them to form Cβ–Cγ bonds with altered side chains. We demonstrate how these transformations enable a wide diversity of natural, unnatural, posttranslationally modified (methylated, glycosylated, phosphorylated, hydroxylated), and labeled (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ated, isotopically labeled) side chains to be added to a common, readily accessible dehydroalanine precursor in a range of representative protein types and scaffolds. This approach, outside of the rigid constraints of the ribosome and enzymatic processing, may be modified more generally for access to diverse proteins.</p>

Improving efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells with photocurable fluoropolymers
<p>Organometal halide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated high conversion efficiency but poor long-term stability against ultraviolet irradiation and water. We show that rapid light–induced free-radical polymerization at ambient temperature produces multifunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorin</span></strong>ated photopolymer coatings that confer luminescent and easy-cleaning features on the front side of the devices, while concurrently forming a strongly hydrophobic barrier toward environmental moisture on the back contact side. The luminescent photopolymers re-emit ultraviolet light in the visible range, boosting perovskite solar cells efficiency to nearly 19% under standard illumination. Coated devices reproducibly retain their full functional performance during prolonged operation, even after a series of severe aging tests carried out for more than 6 months.</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>s required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> MEGA is used to implement all those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>s, thereby eliminating the need to learn several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s, and to deal with multiple file formats from one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>-by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from <ext-link>www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>.</p>

Cash for carbon: A randomized trial of payments for ecosystem services to reduce deforestation
<p>We evaluated a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> of payments for ecosystem services in Uganda that offered forest-owning households annual payments of 70,000 Ugandan shillings per hectare if they conserved their forest. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> was implemented as a randomized controlled trial in 121 villages, 60 of which received the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in land area covered by trees, measured by classifying high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that tree cover declined by 4.2% during the study period in treatment villages, compared to 9.1% in control villages. We found no evidence that enrollees shifted their deforestation to nearby land. We valued the delayed carbon dioxide emissions and found that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> benefit is 2.4 times as large as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> costs.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Genome-Wide Analysis of the Arabidopsis Replication Timing Program
<p>Eukaryotes use a temporally regulated process, known as the replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>, to ensure that their genomes are fully and accurately duplicated during S phase. Replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s are predictive of genomic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of chromatin organization. Although replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to genome sequence and chromatin structure. We used the thymidine analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the genome-wide replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified genomic regions that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and correlated these regions with genomic features and with data for chromatin state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis chromosome arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric regions replicate late. Early and mid-replicating regions are gene-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late regions are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of chromatin states across the different times is complex, with each replication time corresponding to a mixture of states. Early and mid-replicating sequences interact with each other and not with late sequences, but early regions are more accessible than mid regions. The replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite genomic organization with early/mid-replicating regions and late regions forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated largely by chromatin accessibility.</p>

SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE1 Links DNA Damage Response to Organ Regeneration
<p>In Arabidopsis, DNA damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death is limited to the meristematic stem cell niche and its early descendants. The significance of this cell-type-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death is unclear. Here, we demonstrate in roots that it is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med destruction of the mitotically compromised stem cell niche that triggers its regeneration, enabling growth recovery. In contrast to wild-type plants, <i>sog1</i> plants, which are defective in damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death, maintain the cell identities and stereotypical structure of the stem cell niche after irradiation, but these cells fail to undergo cell division, terminating root growth. We propose DNA damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death is employed by plants as a developmental response, contrasting with its role as an anticarcinogenic response in animals. This role in plants may have evolved to restore the growth of embryos after the accumulation of DNA damage in seeds.</p>

Multicellular Transcriptional Analysis of Mammalian Heart Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The inability of the adult mammalian heart to regenerate following injury represents a major barrier in cardiovascular medicine. In contrast, the neonatal mammalian heart retains a transient capacity for regeneration, which is lost shortly after birth. Defining the molecular mechanisms that govern regenerative capacity in the neonatal period remains a central goal in cardiac biology.

TSLP signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells programs a pathogenic T helper 2 cell state
<p>Pathogenic T helper 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) cells, which produce increased amounts of the cytokines interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13, promote allergic disorders, including asthma. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine secreted by epithelial and innate immune cells, stimulates such pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 cell responses. We found that TSLP signaling in mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells initiated transcriptional changes associated with T<sub>H</sub>2 cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ming. IL-4 signaling amplified and stabilized the genomic response of T cells to TSLP, which increased the frequency of T cells producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Furthermore, the TSLP- and IL-4–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med T<sub>H</sub>2 cells had a pathogenic phenotype, producing greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 and other proinflammatory cytokines than did T<sub>H</sub>2 cells stimulated with IL-4 alone. TSLP-mediated T<sub>H</sub>2 cell induction involved distinct molecular pathways, including activation of the transcription factor STAT5 through the kinase JAK2 and repression of the transcription factor BCL6. Mice that received wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had exacerbated pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 cell responses upon exposure to house dust mites compared to mice that received TSLP receptor–deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Transient TSLP signaling stably <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med pathogenic potential in memory T<sub>H</sub>2 cells. In human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, TSLP and IL-4 promoted the generation of T<sub>H</sub>2 cells that produced greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13. Compared to healthy controls, asthmatic children showed enhancement of such T cell responses in peripheral blood. Our data support a sequential cytokine model for pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 cell differentiation and provide a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic targeting of TSLP signaling in human allergic diseases.</p>

Defining the developmental program leading to meiosis in maize

A smooth continuum of expression stages before meiosis was followed by a two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> transcriptome reorganization in leptotene, during which 26.7% of transcripts changed in abundance by twofold or more. Analysis of cell-cycle gene expression indicated that nearly all pregerminal cells proliferate, eliminating a stem-cell model to generate meiotic cells. Mutants defective in somatic differentiation or meiotic commitment expressed transcripts normally present in early meiosis after a delay; thus, the germinal transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> is cell autonomous and can proceed despite meiotic failure.</p>

Commensal-specific T cell plasticity promotes rapid tissue adaptation to injury
<p>Barrier tissues are primary targets of environmental stressors and are home to the largest number of antigen-experienced lymphocytes in the body, including commensal-specific T cells. We found that skin-resident commensal-specific T cells harbor a paradoxical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> characterized by a type 17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> associated with a poised type 2 state. Thus, in the context of injury and exposure to inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-18, these cells rapidly release type 2 cytokines, thereby acquiring contextual functions. Such acquisition of a type 2 effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> promotes tissue repair. Aberrant type 2 responses can also be unleashed in the context of local defects in immunoregulation. Thus, commensal-specific T cells co-opt tissue residency and cell-intrinsic flexibility as a means to promote both local immunity and tissue adaptation to injury.</p>

Structure of a yeast step II catalytically activated spliceosome
<p>Each cycle of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing comprises two sequential reactions, first freeing the 5′ exon and generating an intron lariat–3′ exon and then ligating the two exons and releasing the intron lariat. The second reaction is executed by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> II catalytically activated spliceosome (known as the C* complex). Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of a C* complex from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> at an average resolution of 4.0 angstroms. Compared with the preceding spliceosomal complex (C complex), the lariat junction has been translocated by 15 to 20 angstroms to vacate space for the incoming 3′-exon sequences. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> I splicing factors Cwc25 and Yju2 have been dissociated from the active site. Two catalytic motifs from Prp8 (the 1585 loop and the β finger of the ribonuclease H–like domain), along with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> II splicing factors Prp17 and Prp18 and other surrounding proteins, are poised to assist the second transesterification. These structural features, together with those reported for other spliceosomal complexes, yield a near-complete mechanistic picture on the splicing cycle.</p>

Here, we describe a 3D electron cryomicroscopy structure of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> B<sup>act</sup> complex at 5.8-angstrom resolution. Our model reveals that in B<sup>act</sup>, the catalytic U2/U6 RNA-Prp8 ribonucleoprotein core is already established, and the 5′ splice site (ss) is oriented for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> 1 catalysis but occluded by protein. The first-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> nucleophile—the branchsite adenosine—is sequestered within the Hsh155 HEAT domain and is held 50 angstroms away from the 5′ss.

LTR_retriever: A Highly Accurate and Sensitive Program for Identification of Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons
<p>Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are prevalent in plant genomes. The identification of LTR-RTs is critical for achieving high-quality gene annotation. Based on the well-conserved structure, multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s were developed for the de novo identification of LTR-RTs; however, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s are associated with low specificity and high false discovery rates. Here, we report LTR_retriever, a multithreading-empowered Perl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> that identifies LTR-RTs and generates high-quality LTR libraries from genomic sequences. LTR_retriever demonstrated significant improvements by achieving high levels of sensitivity (91%), specificity (97%), accuracy (96%), and precision (90%) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). LTR_retriever is also compatible with long sequencing reads. With 40k self-corrected PacBio reads equivalent to 4.5× genome coverage in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the constructed LTR library showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. In addition to canonical LTR-RTs with 5′-TG…CA-3′ termini, LTR_retriever also identifies noncanonical LTR-RTs (non-TGCA), which have been largely ignored in genome-wide studies. We identified seven types of noncanonical LTRs from 42 out of 50 plant genomes. The majority of noncanonical LTRs are <i>Copia</i> elements, with which the LTR is four times shorter than that of other <i>Copia</i> elements, which may be a result of their target specificity. Strikingly, non-TGCA <i>Copia</i> elements are often located in genic regions and preferentially insert nearby or within genes, indicating their impact on the evolution of genes and their potential as mutagenesis tools.</p>

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct vegetative and zygotic wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

Diversification of Root Hair Development Genes in Vascular Plants

To understand the extent to which this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> might operate in other plants, we conducted a large-scale comparative analysis of root hair development genes from diverse vascular plants, including eudicots, monocots, and a lycophyte. Combining phylogenetics and transcriptomics, we discovered conservation of a core set of root hair genes across all vascular plants, which may derive from an ancient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for unidirectional cell growth coopted for root hair development during vascular plant evolution. Interestingly, we also discovered preferential diversification in the structure and expression of root hair development genes, relative to other root hair- and root-expressed genes, among these species. These differences enabled the definition of sets of genes and gene functions that were acquired or lost in specific lineages during vascular plant evolution. In particular, we found substantial divergence in the structure and expression of genes used for root hair patterning, suggesting that the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not shared by other species. To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive view of gene expression in a single plant cell type across multiple species.</p>

Understanding and Manipulating Meiotic Recombination in Plants
<p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of chromosomes, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> of meiosis is homologous recombination, which promotes homologous pairing and generates crossovers (COs) to connect homologous chromosomes until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on chromosomes. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per chromosome pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of chromosome size. Moreover, their positions are not random on chromosomes but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the generation of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.</p>

Transcription Factors WOX11/12 Directly Activate <i>WOX5/7</i> to Promote Root Primordia Initiation and Organogenesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>De novo organogenesis, which gives rise to adventitious roots and shoots, is a type of plant regeneration for survival after wounding. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), two main cell fate transition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>s are required to establish the root primordium during de novo root organogenesis from leaf explants. The first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> from regeneration-competent cells to root founder cells involves activation of <i>WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX11</i> (<i>WOX11</i>) and <i>WOX12</i> (<i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i>) expression by auxin. However, the molecular mechanism controlling the second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> of fate transition from root founder cells to root primordium is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the expression levels of <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> decrease while those of <i>WOX5</i> and <i>7</i> (<i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i>) increase during the transition from root founder cells to the root primordium. <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> function genetically upstream of <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i>, and the WOX11/12 proteins directly bind to the promoters of <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> to activate their transcription.

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion pattern (optic flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of optic flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as optic flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant optic flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of optic flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

Exercise Intolerance in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common syndrome with a pressing shortage of therapies. Exercise intolerance is a cardinal symptom of HFpEF, yet its pathophysiology remains uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the mechanism of exercise intolerance in 134 patients referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing: 79 with HFpEF and 55 controls. We performed cardiopulmonary exercise testing with invasive monitoring to measure hemodynamics, blood gases, and gas exchange during exercise. We used these measurements to quantify 6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>s of oxygen transport and utilization (the O<sub>2</sub> pathway) in each patient with HFpEF, identifying the defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>s that impair each one’s exercise capacity (peak Vo<sub>2</sub>). We then quantified the functional significance of each O<sub>2</sub> pathway defect by calculating the improvement in exercise capacity a patient could expect from correcting the defect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Peak Vo<sub>2</sub> was reduced by 34±2% (mean±SEM, <i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF compared with controls of similar age, sex, and body mass index. The vast majority (97%) of patients with HFpEF harbored defects at multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>s of the O<sub>2</sub> pathway, the identity and magnitude of which varied widely. Two of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>s, cardiac output and skeletal muscle O<sub>2</sub> diffusion, were impaired relative to controls by an average of 27±3% and 36±2%, respectively (<i>P</i><0.001 for both). Due to interactions between a given patient’s defects, the predicted benefit of correcting any single one was often minor; on average, correcting a patient’s cardiac output led to a 7±0.5% predicted improvement in exercise intolerance, whereas correcting a patient’s muscle diffusion capacity led to a 27±1% improvement. At the individual level, the impact of any given O<sub>2</sub> pathway defect on a patient’s exercise capacity was strongly influenced by comorbid defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Systematic analysis of the O<sub>2</sub> pathway in HFpEF showed that exercise capacity was undermined by multiple defects, including reductions in cardiac output and skeletal muscle diffusion capacity. An important source of disease heterogeneity stemmed from variation in each patient’s personal profile of defects. Personalized O<sub>2</sub> pathway analysis could identify patients most likely to benefit from treating a specific defect; however, the system properties of O<sub>2</sub> transport favor treating multiple defects at once, as with exercise training.</p></sec>

Histone Methyltransferase G9a Is Required for Cardiomyocyte Homeostasis and Hypertrophy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Correct gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ming of the cardiomyocyte underlies the normal functioning of the heart. Alterations to this can lead to the loss of cardiac homeostasis, triggering heart dysfunction. Although the role of some histone methyltransferases in establishing the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> of postnatal cardiomyocytes during heart development has been shown, the function of this class of epigenetic enzymes is largely unexplored in the adult heart. In this study, we investigated the role of G9a/Ehmt2, a histone methyltransferase that defines a repressive epigenetic signature, in defining the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for cardiomyocyte homeostasis and cardiac hypertrophy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the function of G9a in normal and stressed cardiomyocytes with the use of a conditional, cardiac-specific G9a knockout mouse, a specific G9a inhibitor, and high-throughput approaches for the study of the epigenome (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) and transcriptome (RNA sequencing); traditional methods were used to assess cardiac function and cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that G9a is required for cardiomyocyte homeostasis in the adult heart by mediating the repression of key genes regulating cardiomyocyte function via dimethylation of H3 lysine 9 and interaction with enhancer of zeste homolog 2, the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2, and MEF2C-dependent gene expression by forming a complex with this transcription factor. The G9a-MEF2C complex was found to be required also for the maintenance of heterochromatin needed for the silencing of developmental genes in the adult heart. Moreover, G9a promoted cardiac hypertrophy by repressing antihypertrophic genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Taken together, our findings demonstrate that G9a orchestrates critical epigenetic changes in cardiomyocytes in physiological and pathological conditions, thereby providing novel therapeutic avenues for cardiac pathologies associated with dysregulation of these mechanisms.</p></sec>

AAA-specific mortality data were retrieved from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. A linear regression analysis was used to estimate the effect on AAA-specific mortality among all men ≥65 years of age for the observed time period. The long-term effects were projected by using a validated Markov model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 302 957 men aged 65 years invited, 84% attended. The prevalence of screening-detected AAA was 1.5%.

The introduction of screening was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-specific mortality (mean, 4.0% per year of screening, <i>P</i>=0.020).

In our meta-analysis, intervention effects were calculated for systolic BP and diastolic BP with the use of weighted random-effects models. Of the 23 included intervention studies (involving 18 925 participants), 21 involved a school setting. Our meta-analysis included 19 studies reporting on systolic BP and 18 on diastolic BP. The pooled intervention effect was −1.64 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −2.56 to −0.71; <i>P</i>=0.001) for systolic BP and −1.44 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −2.28 to −0.60; <i>P</i>=0.001) for diastolic BP. The combined diet and physical activity interventions led to a significantly greater reduction in both systolic BP and diastolic BP than the diet-only or physical activity–only intervention.

Single polymer growth dynamics
<p>In chain-growth polymerization, a chain grows continually to reach thousands of subunits. However, the real-time dynamics of chain growth remains unknown. Using magnetic tweezers, we visualized real-time polymer growth at the single-polymer level. Focusing on ring-opening metathesis polymerization, we found that the extension of a growing polymer under a pulling force does not increase continuously but exhibits wait-and-jump <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>s. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>s are attributable to the formation and unraveling of conformational entanglements from newly incorporated monomers, whose key features can be recapitulated with molecular dynamics simulations. The configurations of these entanglements appear to play a key role in determining the polymerization rates and the dispersion among individual polymers.</p>

NIH quietly shelves gun research program

Sterilizing immunity in the lung relies on targeting fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death
<p>Humans inhale mold conidia daily and typically experience lifelong asymptomatic clearance. Conidial germination into tissue-invasive hyphae can occur in individuals with defects in myeloid function, although the mechanism of myeloid cell–mediated immune surveillance remains unclear. By monitoring fungal physiology in vivo, we demonstrate that lung neutrophils trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death with apoptosis-like features in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia, the most prevalent human mold pathogen. An antiapoptotic protein, AfBIR1, opposes this process by inhibiting fungal caspase activation and DNA fragmentation in the murine lung. Genetic and pharmacologic studies indicate that AfBIR1 expression and activity underlie conidial susceptibility to NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase-dependent killing and, in turn, host susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis. Immune surveillance exploits a fungal apoptosis-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death pathway to maintain sterilizing immunity in the lung.</p>

Aging increases cell-to-cell transcriptional variability upon immune stimulation
<p>Aging is characterized by progressive loss of physiological and cellular functions, but the molecular basis of this decline remains unclear. We explored how aging affects transcriptional dynamics using single-cell RNA sequencing of unstimulated and stimulated naive and effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from young and old mice from two divergent species. In young animals, immunological activation drives a conserved transcriptomic switch, resulting in tightly controlled gene expression characterized by a strong up-regulation of a core activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>, coupled with a decrease in cell-to-cell variability. Aging perturbed the activation of this core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> and increased expression heterogeneity across populations of cells in both species. These discoveries suggest that increased cell-to-cell transcriptional variability will be a hallmark feature of aging across most, if not all, mammalian tissues.</p>

Bifurcating electron-transfer pathways in DNA photolyases determine the repair quantum yield
<p>Photolyase is a blue-light–activated enzyme that repairs ultraviolet-induced DNA damage that occurs in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts.

In this study, we used femtosecond spectroscopy to deconvolute seven electron-transfer reactions in 10 elementary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>s in all classes of CPD photolyases. We report a unified electron-transfer pathway through a conserved structural configuration that bifurcates to favor direct tunneling in prokaryotes and a two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> hopping mechanism in eukaryotes. Both bifurcation routes are operative, but their relative contributions, dictated by the reduction potentials of the flavin cofactor and the substrate, determine the overall quantum yield of repair.</p>

The impact of training informal health care providers in India: A randomized controlled trial

Using standardized patients (“mystery clients”), we assessed clinical practice for three different conditions to which both providers and trainers were blinded during the intervention, representative of the range of conditions that these providers normally diagnose and treat. Training increased correct case management by 7.9 percentage points (14.2%) but did not affect the use of unnecessary medicines and antibiotics. At a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> cost of $175 per trainee, our results suggest that multitopic medical training offers an effective short-run strategy to improve health care.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse polar behaviors in response to directional and nondirectional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic behaviors is well understood, but it is less well understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the polarity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med polarity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in polarization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf polarity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and polar transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of polar auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT Functions in Isoprenoid Biosynthesis via the Plastid MEP Pathway
<p>Plastid isoprenoids, a diverse group of compounds that includes carotenoids, chlorophylls, tocopherols, and multiple hormones, are essential for plant growth and development. Here, we identified and characterized <i>SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT</i> (<i>SCD</i>), which encodes an enzyme that functions in the biosynthesis of plastid isoprenoids in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). SCD converts 2<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erytrithol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate to 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate in the penultimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. In <i>scd</i> mutants, plant growth and development are impaired and the levels of MEP-derived isoprenoids, such as carotenoids, chlorophylls, and tocopherols, as well as abscisic and gibberellic acids, are reduced in leaves and seeds. This <i>scd</i> metabolic alteration varies among plant tissues and under different light conditions. RNA-sequencing of the <i>scd</i> mutant and wild type identified a limited number of differentially expressed genes in the MEP pathway, although isoprenoid levels were significantly reduced in <i>scd</i> seeds and dark-grown leaves. Furthermore, <i>SCD</i>-overexpressing transgenic lines showed little or no differences in isoprenoid levels, indicating that SCD may be subject to posttranslational regulation or not represent a rate-limiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> in the MEP pathway. These results enhance our understanding of the transcriptomic and metabolic regulatory roles of enzymes in the MEP pathway and of their effects on downstream isoprenoid pathways in various plant tissues and under different light conditions.</p>

CYP76B74 Catalyzes the 3′′-Hydroxylation of Geranylhydroquinone in Shikonin Biosynthesis
<p>Shikonin and its derivatives are the most abundant naphthoquinone pigments formed in species of the medicinally and economically valuable Boraginaceae. A key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> in the shikonin biosynthetic pathway, namely the C-3′′ hydroxylation of the prenylated phenolic intermediate geranylhydroquinone, is expected to be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450. To identify cytochrome P450 candidates with transcription profiles similar to those of genes known to be involved in shikonin biosynthesis, we carried out coexpression analysis of transcriptome data sets of shikonin-proficient and shikonin-deficient cell lines and examined the spatial expression of candidate genes in different organs of <i>Arnebia euchroma</i>. In biochemical assays using geranylhydroquinone as the substrate, CYP76B74 exhibited geranylhydroquinone 3′′-hydroxylase activity and produced 3′′-hydroxy-geranylhydroquinone. In <i>CYP76B74</i> RNA interference <i>A. euchroma</i> hairy roots, shikonin derivative accumulation decreased dramatically, which demonstrated that CYP76B74 is required for shikonin biosynthesis in the plant. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that CYP76B74 belonged to the CYP76B subfamily and was most likely derived from an ancestral geraniol 10-hydroxylase. In a subcellular localization analysis, a GFP-CYP76B74 fusion localized to endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Our results demonstrate that CYP76B74 catalyzes the key hydroxylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> in shikonin biosynthesis with high efficiency.

Asexual Female Gametogenesis Involves Contact with a Sexually-Fated Megaspore in Apomictic <i>Hieracium</i>
<p>Apomixis results in asexual seed formation where progeny are identical to the maternal plant. In ovules of apomictic species of the <i>Hieracium</i> subgenus <i>Pilosella</i>, meiosis of the megaspore mother cell generates four megaspores. Aposporous initial (AI) cells form during meiosis in most ovules. The sexual pathway terminates during functional megaspore (FM) differentiation, when an enlarged AI undergoes mitosis to form an aposporous female gametophyte. Then, the mitotically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med FM dies along with the three other megaspores by unknown mechanisms. Transcriptomes of laser-dissected AIs, ovule cells, and ovaries from apomicts and AI-deficient mutants were analyzed to understand the pathways involved. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>s leading to AI mitosis and sexual pathway termination were determined using antibodies against arabinogalactan protein epitopes found to mark both sexual and aposporous female gametophyte lineages at inception. At most, four AIs differentiated near developing megaspores. The first expanding AI cell to contact the FM formed a functional AI that underwent mitosis soon after megaspore degeneration. Transcriptome analyses indicated that the enlarged, laser-captured AIs were arrested in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle and were metabolically active. Further comparisons with AI-deficient mutants showed that AIs were enriched in transcripts encoding homologs of genes involved in, and potentially antagonistic to, known FM specification pathways. We propose that AI and FM cell contact provides cues required for AI mitosis and megaspore degeneration. Specific candidates to further interrogate AI-FM interactions were identified here and include <i>Hieracium</i> arabinogalactan protein family genes.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>s in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

NDH-PSI Supercomplex Assembly Precedes Full Assembly of the NDH Complex in Chloroplast
<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex is structurally similar to respiratory complex I and mediates PSI cyclic electron flow. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast NDH is composed of at least 29 subunits and associates with two copies of PSI to form the NDH-PSI supercomplex. Here, we found that CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION3 (CRR3) is an assembly factor required for the accumulation of subcomplex B (SubB) of chloroplast NDH. In Suc density gradient centrifugation, CRR3 was detected in three protein complexes. Accumulation of the largest peak III complex was impaired in mutants defective in the SubB subunits PnsB2-PnsB5. The oligomeric form of CRR3 likely functions to assemble the core of SubB to form the peak III complex as an assembly intermediate. A defect in the PnsL3 subunit increased the level of the peak III complex, suggesting that CRR3 was released from the assembly intermediate after PnsL3 binding. Unlike PnsB2-PnsB5 and PnsL3, PnsB1 was not absolutely necessary for stabilizing SubB. PnsB1 is likely incorporated into the intermediate at the final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> during SubB assembly. Lhca6 is a linker protein mediating NDH-PSI supercomplex formation, and its site of contact with NDH was suggested to be SubB. In the <i>lhca6</i> mutant, accumulation of the peak III complex was impaired, suggesting that SubB interacted with Lhca6 during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> of SubB assembly. The process of supercomplex formation was triggered before the completion of the NDH assembly.

A Program for Iron Economy during Deficiency Targets Specific Fe Proteins
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plants, utilized in nearly every cellular process. Because the adjustment of uptake under Fe limitation cannot satisfy all demands, plants need to acclimate their physiology and biochemistry, especially in their chloroplasts, which have a high demand for Fe. To investigate if a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> exists for the utilization of Fe under deficiency, we analyzed how hydroponically grown Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) adjusts its physiology and Fe protein composition in vegetative photosynthetic tissue during Fe deficiency. Fe deficiency first affected photosynthetic electron transport with concomitant reductions in carbon assimilation and biomass production when effects on respiration were not yet significant. Photosynthetic electron transport function and protein levels of Fe-dependent enzymes were fully recovered upon Fe resupply, indicating that the Fe depletion stress did not cause irreversible secondary damage. At the protein level, ferredoxin, the cytochrome-<i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, and Fe-containing enzymes of the plastid sulfur assimilation pathway were major targets of Fe deficiency, whereas other Fe-dependent functions were relatively less affected. In coordination, SufA and SufB, two proteins of the plastid Fe-sulfur cofactor assembly pathway, were also diminished early by Fe depletion. Iron depletion reduced mRNA levels for the majority of the affected proteins, indicating that loss of enzyme was not just due to lack of Fe cofactors. SufB and ferredoxin were early targets of transcript down-regulation. The data reveal a hierarchy for Fe utilization in photosynthetic tissue and indicate that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> is in place to acclimate to impending Fe deficiency.</p>

Dynamic Cytology and Transcriptional Regulation of Rice Lamina Joint Development
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) leaf angle is determined by lamina joint and is an important agricultural trait determining leaf erectness and, hence, the photosynthesis efficiency and grain yield. Genetic studies reveal a complex regulatory network of lamina joint development; however, the morphological changes, cytological transitions, and underlying transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ming remain to be elucidated. A systemic morphological and cytological study reveals a dynamic developmental process and suggests a common but distinct regulation of the lamina joint. Successive and sequential cell division and expansion, cell wall thickening, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death at the adaxial or abaxial sides form the cytological basis of the lamina joint, and the increased leaf angle results from the asymmetric cell proliferation and elongation. Analysis of the gene expression profiles at four distinct developmental stages ranging from initiation to senescence showed that genes related to cell division and growth, hormone synthesis and signaling, transcription (transcription factors), and protein phosphorylation (protein kinases) exhibit distinct spatiotemporal patterns during lamina joint development. Phytohormones play crucial roles by promoting cell differentiation and growth at early stages or regulating the maturation and senescence at later stages, which is consistent with the quantitative analysis of hormones at different stages. Further comparison with the gene expression profile of <i>leaf inclination1</i>, a mutant with decreased auxin and increased leaf angle, indicates the coordinated effects of hormones in regulating lamina joint. These results reveal a dynamic cytology of rice lamina joint that is fine-regulated by multiple factors, providing informative clues for illustrating the regulatory mechanisms of leaf angle and plant architecture.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete fertility of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ed cell death , producing fertile gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive barriers.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 protein of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein family, which also includes the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible proteins, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix proteins and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible proteins. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, protein interaction, and integration of interacting partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple protein-protein interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their protein products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong>s in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">step</span></strong> in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

MAP Kinase PrMPK9-1 Contributes to the Self-Incompatibility Response
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) form important signaling modules for a variety of cellular responses in eukaryotic cells. In plants, MAPKs play key roles in growth and development as well as in immunity/stress responses. Pollen-pistil interactions are critical early events regulating pollination and fertilization and involve many signaling events. Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism to prevent self-fertilization and inbreeding in higher plants and also is known to utilize signaling to achieve incompatible pollen rejection. Although several pollen-expressed MAPKs exist, very little is known about their function. We previously identified a pollen-expressed MAPK (p56) from <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> that was rapidly activated during SI; several studies implicated its role in signaling to SI-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death involving a DEVDase. However, to date, the identity of the MAPK involved has been unknown. Here, we have identified and cloned a pollen-expressed <i>P. rhoeas</i> threonine-aspartate-tyrosine (TDY) MAPK, <i>PrMPK9-1</i>. Rather few data relating to the function of TDY MAPKs in plants currently exist. We provide evidence that <i>PrMPK9-1</i> has a cell type-specific function, with a distinct role from <i>AtMPK9</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first study implicating a function for a TDY MAPK in pollen. We show that PrMPK9-1 corresponds to p56 and demonstrate that it is functionally involved in mediating SI in <i>P. rhoeas</i> pollen: PrMPK9-1 is a key regulator for SI in pollen and acts upstream of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death involving actin and activation of a DEVDase. Our study provides an important advance in elucidating functional roles for this class of MAPKs.</p>

A Subset of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes Is Essential for Plant Immunity
<p>Of the three classes of enzymes involved in ubiquitination, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) have been often incorrectly considered to play merely an auxiliary role in the process, and few E2 enzymes have been investigated in plants. To reveal the role of E2 in plant innate immunity, we identified and cloned 40 tomato genes encoding ubiquitin E2 proteins. Thioester assays indicated that the majority of the genes encode enzymatically active E2. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 40 tomato E2 enzymes into 13 groups, of which members of group III were found to interact and act specifically with AvrPtoB, a <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> effector that uses its ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity to suppress host immunity. Knocking down the expression of group III E2 genes in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> diminished the AvrPtoB-promoted degradation of the Fen kinase and the AvrPtoB suppression of host immunity-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death. Importantly, silencing group III E2 genes also resulted in reduced pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). By contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death induced by several effector-triggered immunity elicitors was not affected on group III-silenced plants. Functional characterization suggested redundancy among group III members for their role in the suppression of plant immunity by AvrPtoB and in PTI and identified UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING11 (UBC11), UBC28, UBC29, UBC39, and UBC40 as playing a more significant role in PTI than other group III members. Our work builds a foundation for the further characterization of E2s in plant immunity and reveals that AvrPtoB has evolved a strategy for suppressing host immunity that is difficult for the plant to thwart.</p>

Phytoglobins Improve Hypoxic Root Growth by Alleviating Apical Meristem Cell Death
<p>Hypoxic root growth in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is influenced by the expression of phytoglobins (<i>ZmPgbs</i>). Relative to the wild type, suppression of <i>ZmPgb1.1</i> or <i>ZmPgb1.2</i> inhibits the growth of roots exposed to 4% oxygen, causing structural abnormalities in the root apical meristems. These effects were accompanied by increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), possibly through the transcriptional induction of four <i>Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs</i>. TUNEL-positive nuclei in meristematic cells indicated the involvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death (PCD) in the process. These cells also accumulated nitric oxide and stained heavily for ethylene biosynthetic transcripts. A sharp increase in the expression level of several 1-aminocyclopropane synthase (<i>ZmAcs2</i>, <i>ZmAcs6</i>, and <i>ZmAcs7</i>), 1-aminocyclopropane oxidase (<i>Aco15</i>, <i>Aco20</i>, <i>Aco31</i>, and <i>Aco35</i>), and ethylene-responsive (<i>ZmErf2</i> and <i>ZmEbf1</i>) genes was observed in hypoxic <i>ZmPgb</i>-suppressing roots, which overproduced ethylene. Inhibiting ROS synthesis with diphenyleneiodonium or ethylene perception with 1-methylcyclopropene suppressed PCD, increased <i>BAX inhibitor-1</i>, an effective attenuator of the death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s in eukaryotes, and restored root growth. Hypoxic roots overexpressing <i>ZmPgbs</i> had the lowest level of ethylene and showed a reduction in ROS staining and TUNEL-positive nuclei in the meristematic cells. These roots retained functional meristems and exhibited the highest growth performance when subjected to hypoxic conditions. Collectively, these results suggest a novel function of Pgbs in protecting root apical meristems from hypoxia-induced PCD through mechanisms initiated by nitric oxide and mediated by ethylene via ROS.</p>

Heterochronic Meiotic Misexpression in an Interspecific Yeast Hybrid
<p>Regulatory changes rapidly accumulate between species, and interspecific hybrids often misexpress genes. Hybrid misexpression, expression levels outside the range of both parental species, can result from <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-acting regulatory changes that interact abnormally in hybrids. Thus, misexpressed genes may contribute to hybrid sterility. However, in the context of a whole organism, misexpression may not result directly from <i>cis–trans</i> interactions but rather indirectly from differences between hybrid and parental abundance of cell types. Here we eliminate the confounding effects of cell types by examining gene expression in a sterile interspecific yeast hybrid during meiosis. We investigated gene expression of the yeasts <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>S. paradoxus</i>, and their hybrid at multiple meiotic stages. Although the hybrid and parents exhibit similar changes in expression levels across meiosis, the hybrid meiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> occurs earlier than either parent. The timing change produces a heterochronic pattern of misexpression during midmeiosis. Coincident with the timing of misexpression, we find a transition from predominantly <i>trans</i>-acting to <i>cis-</i>acting expression divergence and an increase in the number of opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes. However, we find no direct relationship between opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes and misexpression. Contrary to the notion that <i>cis–trans</i> interactions cause misexpression, a heterochronic shift in the normal meiotic gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> produces patterns of misexpression in an yeast hybrid. Our results imply that temporal dynamics of single cell types is important to understanding hybrid misexpression and its relationship to <i>cis–trans</i> interactions.</p>

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood

Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-risk plasma lipid levels were defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Cholesterol Levels in Children. High cIMT was defined as a study-specific value ≥90th percentile. Age and sex were included in each model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In univariate models, all risk factors except for borderline high and high triglycerides in adolescence were associated with high cIMT in adulthood. In multivariable models (relative risk [95% confidence interval]), male sex (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) remained significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05). The addition of lipids into the nonlaboratory risk model slightly but significantly improved discrimination in predicting high cIMT compared with nonlaboratory-based risk factors only (C statistics for laboratory-based model 0.717 [95% confidence interval, 0.685–0.748] and for nonlaboratory 0.698 [95% confidence interval, 0.667–0.731]; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Nonlaboratory-based risk factors and lipids measured in adolescence independently predicted preclinical atherosclerosis in young adulthood.

Fibroblast-Specific Genetic Manipulation of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase In Vivo Reveals Its Central Regulatory Role in Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the heart, acute injury induces a fibrotic healing response that generates collagen-rich scarring that is at first protective but if inappropriately sustained can worsen heart disease. The fibrotic process is initiated by cytokines, neuroendocrine effectors, and mechanical strain that promote resident fibroblast differentiation into contractile and extracellular matrix–producing myofibroblasts. The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α (<i>Mapk14</i> gene) is known to influence the cardiac injury response, but its direct role in orchestrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med fibroblast differentiation and fibrosis in vivo is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A conditional <i>Mapk14</i> allele was used to delete the p38α encoding gene specifically in cardiac fibroblasts or myofibroblasts with 2 different tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase–expressing gene–targeted mouse lines. Mice were subjected to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation and monitored for survival, cardiac function, and fibrotic remodeling. Antithetically, mice with fibroblast-specific transgenic overexpression of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, a direct inducer of p38, were generated to investigate whether this pathway can directly drive myofibroblast formation and the cardiac fibrotic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In mice, loss of <i>Mapk14</i> blocked cardiac fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and ensuing fibrosis in response to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation. A similar inhibition of myofibroblast formation and healing was also observed in a dermal wounding model with deletion of <i>Mapk14</i>. Transgenic mice with fibroblast-specific activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6–p38 developed interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in the heart, lung, and kidney as a result of enhanced myofibroblast numbers. Mechanistic experiments show that p38 transduces cytokine and mechanical signals into myofibroblast differentiation through the transcription factor serum response factor and the signaling effector calcineurin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings suggest that signals from diverse modes of injury converge on p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase within the fibroblast to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> the fibrotic response and myofibroblast formation in vivo, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach with p38 inhibitors for future clinical application.</p></sec>

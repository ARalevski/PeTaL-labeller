Tropism for tuft cells determines immune promotion of norovirus pathogenesis
<p>Complex interactions between host immunity and the microbiome regulate norovirus infection. However, the mechanism of host immune promotion of enteric virus infection remains obscure. The cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tropism</span></strong> of noroviruses is also unknown. Recently, we identified CD300lf as a murine norovirus (MNoV) receptor. In this study, we have shown that tuft cells, a rare type of intestinal epithelial cell, express CD300lf and are the target cell for MNoV in the mouse intestine. We found that type 2 cytokines, which induce tuft cell proliferation, promote MNoV infection in vivo. These cytokines can replace the effect of commensal microbiota in promoting virus infection. Our work thus provides insight into how the immune system and microbes can coordinately promote enteric viral infection.</p>

Transferrin receptor 1 is a reticulocyte-specific receptor for <i>Plasmodium vivax</i>
<p><i>Plasmodium vivax</i> shows a strict host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tropism</span></strong> for reticulocytes. We identified transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) as the receptor for <i>P. vivax</i> reticulocyte-binding protein 2b (PvRBP2b). We determined the structure of the N-terminal domain of PvRBP2b involved in red blood cell binding, elucidating the molecular basis for TfR1 recognition. We validated TfR1 as the biological target of PvRBP2b engagement by means of TfR1 expression knockdown analysis. TfR1 mutant cells deficient in PvRBP2b binding were refractory to invasion of <i>P. vivax</i> but not to invasion of <i>P. falciparum</i>. Using Brazilian and Thai clinical isolates, we show that PvRBP2b monoclonal antibodies that inhibit reticulocyte binding also block <i>P. vivax</i> entry into reticulocytes. These data show that TfR1-PvRBP2b invasion pathway is critical for the recognition of reticulocytes during <i>P. vivax</i> invasion.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion from actin-mediated transport and measured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth. This model predicts that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

Drag, but not buoyancy, affects swim speed in captive Steller sea lions
<p>Swimming at an optimal speed is critical for breath-hold divers seeking to maximize the time they can spend foraging underwater. Theoretical studies have predicted that the optimal swim speed for an animal while transiting to and from depth is independent of <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">buoyanc</span></strong>y, but is dependent on drag and metabolic rate. However, this prediction has never been experimentally tested. Our study assessed the effects of <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">buoyanc</span></strong>y and drag on the swim speed of three captive Steller sea lions (<i>Eumetopias jubatus</i>) that made 186 dives. Our study animals were trained to dive to feed at fixed depths (10–50 m) under artificially controlled <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">buoyanc</span></strong>y and drag conditions. <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">buoyanc</span></strong>y and drag were manipulated using a pair of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes attached to harnesses worn by the sea lions, and <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">buoyanc</span></strong>y conditions were designed to fall within the natural range of wild animals (∼12–26% subcutaneous fat). Drag conditions were changed with and without the PVC tubes, and swim speeds were recorded and compared during descent and ascent phases using an accelerometer attached to the harnesses. Generalized linear mixed-effect models with the animal as the random variable and five explanatory variables (body mass, <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">buoyanc</span></strong>y, dive depth, dive phase, and drag) showed that swim speed was best predicted by two variables, drag and dive phase (AIC = −139). Consistent with a previous theoretical prediction, the results of our study suggest that the optimal swim speed of Steller sea lions is a function of drag, and is independent of dive depth and <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">buoyanc</span></strong>y.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong></span></strong>es of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

A disease-linked <i>ULBP6</i> polymorphism inhibits NKG2D-mediated target cell killing by enhancing the stability of NKG2D ligand binding
<p>NKG2D (natural killer group 2, member D) is an activating receptor found on the surface of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, which regulates innate and adaptive immunity through recognition of the stress-induced ligands ULBP1 (UL16 binding protein 1) to ULBP6 and MICA/B. Similar to class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA), these NKG2D ligands have a major histocompatibility complex–like fold and exhibit pronounced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>ism, which influences human disease susceptibility. However, whereas class I HLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>isms occur predominantly in the α1α2 groove and affect antigen binding, the effects of most NKG2D ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>isms are unclear. We studied the molecular and functional consequences of the two major alleles of <i>ULBP6</i>, the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>ic <i>ULBP</i> gene, which are associated with autoimmunity and relapse after stem cell transplantation. Surface plasmon resonance and crystallography studies revealed that the arginine-to-leucine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>ism within ULBP0602 affected the NKG2D-ULBP6 interaction by generating an energetic hotspot. This resulted in an NKG2D-ULBP0602 affinity of 15.5 nM, which is 10- to 1000-fold greater than the affinities of other ULBP-NKG2D interactions and limited NKG2D-mediated activation. In addition, soluble ULBP0602 exhibited high-affinity competitive binding for NKG2D and partially suppressed NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells by other NKG2D ligands. These effects resulted in a decrease in a range of NKG2D-mediated effector functions. Our results reveal that <i>ULBP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>isms affect the strength of human lymphocyte responses to cellular stress signals and may offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>isms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Hindered cytoplasmic diffusion of inositol trisphosphate restricts its cellular range of action
<p>The range of action of intracellular messengers is determined by their rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion and degradation. Previous measurements in oocyte cytoplasmic extracts indicated that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-liberating second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es with a coefficient (~280 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) similar to that in water, corresponding to a range of action of ~25 μm. Consequently, IP<sub>3</sub> is generally considered a “global” cellular messenger. We reexamined this issue by measuring local IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs to monitor IP<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ing from spot photorelease in neuroblastoma cells. Fitting these data by numerical simulations yielded a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient (≤10 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) about 30-fold slower than that previously reported. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of IP<sub>3</sub> in mammalian cells is hindered by binding to immobile, functionally inactive receptors that were diluted in oocyte extracts. The predicted range of action of IP<sub>3</sub> (<5 μm) is thus smaller than the size of typical mammalian cells, indicating that IP<sub>3</sub> should better be considered as a local rather than a global cellular messenger.</p>

Design and control of gas diffusion process in a nanoporous soft crystal

Winter color polymorphisms identify global hot spots for evolutionary rescue from climate change
<p>Maintenance of biodiversity in a rapidly changing climate will depend on the efficacy of evolutionary rescue, whereby population declines due to abrupt environmental change are reversed by shifts in genetically driven adaptive traits. However, a lack of traits known to be under direct selection by anthropogenic climate change has limited the incorporation of evolutionary processes into global conservation efforts. In 21 vertebrate species, some individuals undergo a seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> molt from summer brown to winter white as camouflage against snow, whereas other individuals remain brown. Seasonal snow duration is decreasing globally, and fitness is lower for winter white animals on snowless backgrounds. Based on 2713 georeferenced samples of known winter coat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>—from eight species across trophic levels—we identify environmentally driven clinal gradients in winter coat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>ic zones where winter brown and white morphs co-occur. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>ic zones, underrepresented by existing global protected area networks, indicate hot spots for evolutionary rescue in a changing climate.</p>

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-loading pathway has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-loading types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. However, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the structure of PD has not been considered, even though it could impact permeability, and functional data are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, structure, and function using data from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was conducted for all relevant cell–cell interfaces in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-loading types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell interfaces in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-loading type. PD density data of single interfaces, even combined with PD diameter and length data, did not correlate with the intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD substructure not visible on standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results support a proposed passive symplasmic loading mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD structure differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-loading species.</p>

EIN3-LIKE1, MYB1, and ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3 Act in a Regulatory Loop That Synergistically Modulates Ethylene Biosynthesis and Anthocyanin Accumulation

Furthermore, MdMYB1 interacted with the promoter of <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3</i>, a key regulator of ethylene biosynthesis, thereby providing a positive feedback for ethylene biosynthesis regulation.

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed coat’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed coat, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed coat pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed coat development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed coat permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es.</p>

Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Spin transport in a Mott insulator of ultracold fermions
<p>Strongly correlated materials are expected to feature unconventional transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es, such that charge, spin, and heat conduction are potentially independent probes of the dynamics. In contrast to charge transport, the measurement of spin transport in such materials is highly challenging. We observed spin conduction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion in a system of ultracold fermionic atoms that realizes the half-filled Fermi-Hubbard model. For strong interactions, spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion is driven by super-exchange and doublon-hole–assisted tunneling, and strongly violates the quantum limit of charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion. The technique developed in this work can be extended to finite doping, which can shed light on the complex interplay between spin and charge in the Hubbard model.</p>

Social network plasticity decreases disease transmission in a eusocial insect
<p>Animal social networks are shaped by multiple selection pressures, including the need to ensure efficient communication and functioning while simultaneously limiting disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Social animals could potentially further reduce epidemic risk by altering their social networks in the presence of pathogens, yet there is currently no evidence for such pathogen-triggered responses. We tested this hypothesis experimentally in the ant <i>Lasius niger</i> using a combination of automated tracking, controlled pathogen exposure, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion quantification, and temporally explicit simulations. Pathogen exposure induced behavioral changes in both exposed ants and their nestmates, which helped contain the disease by reinforcing key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion-inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of the colony’s contact network. This suggests that social network plasticity in response to pathogens is an effective strategy for mitigating the effects of disease in social groups.</p>

Observation of an environmentally insensitive solid-state spin defect in diamond
<p>Engineering coherent systems is a central goal of quantum science. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> centers in diamond are a promising approach, with the potential to combine the coherence of atoms with the scalability of a solid-state platform. We report a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> center that shows insensitivity to environmental decoherence caused by phonons and electric field noise: the neutral charge state of silicon vacancy (SiV<sup>0</sup>). Through careful materials engineering, we achieved >80% conversion of implanted silicon to SiV<sup>0</sup>. SiV<sup>0</sup> exhibits spin-lattice relaxation times approaching 1 minute and coherence times approaching 1 second. Its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong></span></strong>es are very favorable, with ~90% of its emission into the zero-phonon line and near–transform-limited optical linewidths.

Chameleon-like elastomers with molecularly encoded strain-adaptive stiffening and coloration

We provide a solution to this problem by uniting these functions in moldable elastomers through the self-assembly of linear-bottlebrush-linear triblock copolymers. Microphase separation of the architecturally distinct blocks results in physically cross-linked networks that display vibrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>, extreme softness, and intense strain stiffening on par with that of skin tissue. Each of these functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es is regulated by the structure of one macromolecule, without the need for chemical cross-linking or additives. These materials remain stable under conditions characteristic of internal bodily environments and under ambient conditions, neither swelling in bodily fluids nor drying when exposed to air.</p>

When early adopters don't adopt
<p>Individuals who naturally adopt a new technology early are important for influencing whether and how the technology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es more broadly among later users (<i>1</i>–<i>7</i>). Such natural early adopters (NEAs) may influence the difference between successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of new technology and failure. Yet the factors that most influence how and why NEAs engage with new technologies are not entirely understood. We asked, “What if natural early adopters are not able to adopt early?” This paper is the first to measure the counterfactual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion curve that occurs when NEAs are not allowed to adopt early. The results suggest that NEAs can stifle broader <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of a technology if their usual ability to be first—and to derive value from being first—is compromised. Small changes in the initial availability of a technology among different types of users can have a lasting effect on its potential.</p>

High-resolution lithosphere viscosity and dynamics revealed by magnetotelluric imaging
<p>An accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">viscos</span></strong>ity structure is critical to truthfully modeling lithosphere dynamics. Here, we report an attempt to infer the effective lithospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">viscos</span></strong>ity from a high-resolution magnetotelluric (MT) survey across the western United States. The high sensitivity of MT fields to the presence of electrically conductive fluids makes it a promising proxy for determining mechanical strength variations throughout the lithosphere. We demonstrate how a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">viscos</span></strong>ity structure, approximated from electrical resistivity, results in a geodynamic model that successfully predicts short-wavelength surface topography, lithospheric deformation, and mantle upwelling beneath recent volcanism. We further show that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">viscos</span></strong>ity is physically consistent with and better constrained than that derived from laboratory-based rheology. We conclude that MT imaging provides a practical observational constraint for quantifying the dynamic evolution of the continental lithosphere.</p>

Heterohexamers Formed by CcmK3 and CcmK4 Increase the Complexity of Beta Carboxysome Shells
<p>Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) encapsulate enzymes within a selectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permeabl</span></strong>e, proteinaceous shell. Carboxysomes are BMCs containing ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase and carbonic anhydrase that enhance carbon dioxide fixation. The carboxysome shell consists of three structurally characterized protein types, each named after the oligomer they form: BMC-H (hexamer), BMC-P (pentamer), and BMC-T (trimer). These three protein types form cyclic homooligomers with pores at the center of symmetry that enable metabolite transport across the shell. Carboxysome shells contain multiple BMC-H paralogs, each with distinctly conserved residues surrounding the pore, which are assumed to be associated with specific metabolites. We studied the regulation of β-carboxysome shell composition by investigating the BMC-H genes <i>ccmK3</i> and <i>ccmK4</i> situated in a locus remote from other carboxysome genes. We made single and double deletion mutants of <i>ccmK3</i> and <i>ccmK4</i> in <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942 and show that, unlike CcmK3, CcmK4 is necessary for optimal growth. In contrast to other CcmK proteins, CcmK3 does not form homohexamers; instead CcmK3 forms heterohexamers with CcmK4 with a 1:2 stoichiometry. The CcmK3-CcmK4 heterohexamers form stacked dodecamers in a pH-dependent manner. Our results indicate that CcmK3-CcmK4 heterohexamers potentially expand the range of permeability <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of metabolite channels in carboxysome shells. Moreover, the observed facultative formation of dodecamers in solution suggests that carboxysome shell permeability may be dynamically attenuated by “capping” facet-embedded hexamers with a second hexamer. Because β-carboxysomes are obligately expressed, heterohexamer formation and capping could provide a rapid and reversible means to alter metabolite flux across the shell in response to environmental/growth conditions.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been measured previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permeabl</span></strong>e substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation and morphology of one sex or species with the leg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male recognition template for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) target for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging–evaluated total number of new ischemic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) years in the low-target group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) years in the high-target group (n=98). Procedural risk scores were comparable between groups. Overall, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging revealed new cerebral lesions in 52.8% of patients in the low-target group versus 55.7% in the high-target group (<i>P</i>=0.76). The primary outcome of volume of new cerebral lesions was comparable between groups, 25 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–118 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–25 261 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the low-target group versus 29 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–143 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–22 116 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the high-target group (median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, −25 to 0.028; <i>P</i>=0.99), as was the secondary outcome of number of new lesions (1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–24] versus 1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–29] respectively; median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, 0–0; <i>P</i>=0.71).

All subjects received standard medical therapy. Subjects in the RIPC and sham groups underwent RIPC and sham RIPC twice daily, respectively, for 2 weeks before CAS. Plasma neuron-specific enolase and S-100B were used to evaluate safety, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, and new ischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging lesions were used to determine treatment efficacy. The primary outcomes were the presence of ≥1 newly ischemic brain lesions on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging within 48 hours after stenting and clinical events within 6 months after stenting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We randomly assigned 189 subjects in this study (63 subjects in each group). Both RIPC and sham RIPC procedures were well tolerated and completed with high compliance (98.41% and 95.24%, respectively). Neither plasma neuron-specific enolase levels nor S-100B levels changed significantly before and after treatment. No severe adverse event was attributed to RIPC and sham RIPC procedures. The incidence of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging lesions in the RIPC group (15.87%) was significantly lower than in the sham group (36.51%; relative risk, 0.44; 96% confidence interval, 0.20–0.91; <i>P</i><0.01) and the control group (41.27%; relative risk, 0.39; 96% confidence interval, 0.21–0.82; <i>P</i><0.01).

Multivalent counterions diminish the lubricity of polyelectrolyte brushes
<p>Polyelectrolyte brushes provide wear protection and lubrication in many technical, medical, physiological, and biological applications. Wear resistance and low friction are attributed to counterion osmotic pressure and the hydration layer surrounding the charged polymer segments. However, the presence of multivalent counterions in solution can strongly affect the interchain interactions and structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of brush layers. We evaluated the lubrication <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of polystyrene sulfonate brush layers sliding against each other in aqueous solutions containing increasing concentrations of counterions. The presence of multivalent ions (Y<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>), even at minute concentrations, markedly increases the friction forces between brush layers owing to electrostatic bridging and brush collapse. Our results suggest that the lubricating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of polyelectrolyte brushes in multivalent solution are hindered relative to those in monovalent solution.</p>

German law allows use of DNA to predict suspects' looks

The controversial law, which passed the Landtag, the state parliament in Munich, on 15 May, is the first in Germany to allow what has been dubbed DNA phenotyping, and it has sparked renewed debate here and in other countries about the advantages—and risks—of the technology. German federal authorities, and police in the country's 15 other states, are only allowed to perform DNA fingerprinting, in which they look for an exact match between crime scene DNA and samples in a database of known criminals or from a suspect. DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction, however, have been used in the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and several U.S. states. Some critics caution that although the underlying science connecting genetic markers to certain physical features is solid, DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction still come with significant uncertainties that can be easily misunderstood by police and the public.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Experiments

<i>C1orf106</i> is a colitis risk gene that regulates stability of epithelial adherens junctions
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>isms in <i>C1orf106</i> are associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the function of C1orf106 and the consequences of disease-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>isms are unknown. Here we demonstrate that C1orf106 regulates adherens junction stability by regulating the degradation of cytohesin-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that controls activation of ARF6. By limiting cytohesin-1–dependent ARF6 activation, C1orf106 stabilizes adherens junctions. Consistent with this model, <i>C1orf106</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice exhibit defects in the intestinal epithelial cell barrier, a phenotype observed in IBD patients that confers increased susceptibility to intestinal pathogens. Furthermore, the IBD risk variant increases C1orf106 ubiquitination and turnover with consequent functional impairments. These findings delineate a mechanism by which a genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>ism fine-tunes intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and elucidate a fundamental mechanism of cellular junctional control.</p>

Spindle asymmetry drives non-Mendelian chromosome segregation
<p>Genetic elements compete for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion through meiosis, when haploid gametes are created from a diploid parent. Selfish elements can enhance their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion through a process known as meiotic drive. In female meiosis, selfish elements drive by preferentially attaching to the egg side of the spindle. This implies some asymmetry between the two sides of the spindle, but the molecular mechanisms underlying spindle asymmetry are unknown. Here we found that CDC42 signaling from the cell cortex regulated microtubule tyrosination to induce spindle asymmetry and that non-Mendelian segregation depended on this asymmetry. Cortical CDC42 depends on polarization directed by chromosomes, which are positioned near the cortex to allow the asymmetric cell division. Thus, selfish meiotic drivers exploit the asymmetry inherent in female meiosis to bias their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion.</p>

Inactivation of porcine endogenous retrovirus in pigs using CRISPR-Cas9
<p>Xenotransplantation is a promising strategy to alleviate the shortage of organs for human transplantation. In addition to the concerns about pig-to-human immunological compatibility, the risk of cross-species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imped</span></strong>ed the clinical application of this approach. We previously demonstrated the feasibility of inactivating PERV activity in an immortalized pig cell line. We now confirm that PERVs infect human cells, and we observe the horizontal transfer of PERVs among human cells. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we inactivated all of the PERVs in a porcine primary cell line and generated PERV-inactivated pigs via somatic cell nuclear transfer. Our study highlights the value of PERV inactivation to prevent cross-species viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and demonstrates the successful production of PERV-inactivated animals to address the safety concern in clinical xenotransplantation.</p>

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally transmitted Zika virus has been documented in the United States this year, a reflection of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with efforts to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid spread of the virus through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population immune. This so-called "herd immunity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika virus to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a vaccine against Zika, which caused widespread alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain deformities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the virus while they were pregnant. But with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in the region becoming scarce, it does complicate efforts of clinical trials that hope to show lower rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and disease in vaccinated people.

Direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials
<p>Photolithography is an important manufacturing process that relies on using photoresists, typically polymer formulations, that change solubility when illuminated with ultraviolet light. Here, we introduce a general chemical approach for photoresist-free, direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials. The patterned materials can be metals, semiconductors, oxides, magnetic, or rare earth compositions. No organic impurities are present in the patterned layers, which helps achieve good electronic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong></span></strong>es. The conductivity, carrier mobility, dielectric, and luminescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of optically patterned layers are on par with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of state-of-the-art solution-processed materials. The ability to directly pattern all-inorganic layers by using a light exposure dose comparable with that of organic photoresists provides an alternate route for thin-film device manufacturing.</p>

Nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance with chemical resolution
<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a key analytical technique in chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, conventional NMR spectroscopy requires an at least nanoliter-sized sample volume to achieve sufficient signal. We combined the use of a quantum memory and high magnetic fields with a dedicated quantum sensor based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond to achieve chemical shift resolution in <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy of 20-zeptoliter sample volumes. We demonstrate the application of NMR pulse sequences to achieve homonuclear decoupling and spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion measurements. The best measured NMR linewidth of a liquid sample was ~1 part per million, mainly limited by molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion. To mitigate the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, we performed high-resolution solid-state NMR by applying homonuclear decoupling and achieved a 20-fold narrowing of the NMR linewidth.</p>

Imaging the distribution of transient viscosity after the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.1 Kumamoto earthquake
<p>The deformation of mantle and crustal rocks in response to stress plays a crucial role in the distribution of seismic and volcanic hazards, controlling tectonic processes ranging from continental drift to earthquake triggering. However, the spatial variation of these dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es is poorly understood as they are difficult to measure. We exploited the large stress perturbation incurred by the 2016 earthquake sequence in Kumamoto, Japan, to directly image localized and distributed deformation. The earthquakes illuminated distinct regions of low effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">viscos</span></strong>ity in the lower crust, notably beneath the Mount Aso and Mount Kuju volcanoes, surrounded by larger-scale variations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">viscos</span></strong>ity across the back-arc.

Rosetta’s comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko sheds its dusty mantle to reveal its icy nature
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft has investigated comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from large heliocentric distances to its perihelion passage and beyond. We trace the seasonal and diurnal evolution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>s of the 67P nucleus, finding changes driven by sublimation and recondensation of water ice. The whole nucleus became relatively bluer near perihelion, as increasing activity removed the surface dust, implying that water ice is widespread underneath the surface. We identified large (1500 square meters) ice-rich patches appearing and then vanishing in about 10 days, indicating small-scale heterogeneities on the nucleus. Thin frosts sublimating in a few minutes are observed close to receding shadows, and rapid variations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> are seen on extended areas close to the terminator. These cyclic processes are widespread and lead to continuously, slightly varying surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es.</p>

Sensitive electromechanical sensors using viscoelastic graphene-polymer nanocomposites

Characterization of CRISPR Mutants Targeting Genes Modulating Pectin Degradation in Ripening Tomato
<p>Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a globally important crop with an economic value in the tens of billions of dollars, and a significant supplier of essential vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals in the human diet. Shelf life is a key quality trait related to alterations in cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es and remodeling of the fruit cell walls. Studies with transgenic tomato plants undertaken over the last 20 years have indicated that a range of pectin-degrading enzymes are involved in cell wall remodeling. These studies usually involved silencing of only a single gene and it has proved difficult to compare the effects of silencing these genes across the different experimental systems. Here we report the generation of CRISPR-based mutants in the ripening-related genes encoding the pectin-degrading enzymes pectate lyase (PL), polygalacturonase 2a (PG2a), and β-galactanase (TBG4). Comparison of the physio<strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong></span></strong>es of the fruits from a range of <i>PL</i>, <i>PG2a</i>, and <i>TBG4</i> CRISPR lines demonstrated that only mutations in <i>PL</i> resulted in firmer fruits, although mutations in <i>PG2a</i> and <i>TBG4</i> influenced fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> and weight. Pectin localization, distribution, and solubility in the pericarp cells of the CRISPR mutant fruits were investigated using the monoclonal antibody probes LM19 to deesterified homogalacturonan, INRA-RU1 to rhamnogalacturonan I, LM5 to β-1,4-galactan, and LM6 to arabinan epitopes, respectively. The data indicate that PL, PG2a, and TBG4 act on separate cell wall domains and the importance of cellulose microfibril-associated pectin is reflected in its increased occurrence in the different mutant lines.</p>

Plasma Membrane-Type Aquaporins from Marine Diatoms Function as CO<sub>2</sub>/NH<sub>3</sub> Channels and Provide Photoprotection
<p>Aquaporins (AQPs) are ubiquitous water channels that facilitate the transport of many small molecules and may play multiple vital roles in aquatic environments. In particular, mechanisms to maintain transmembrane fluxes of important small molecules have yet to be studied in marine photoautotrophic organisms. Here, we report the occurrence of multiple AQPs with differential cellular localizations in marine diatoms, an important group of oceanic primary producers. The AQPs play a role in mediating the permeability of membranes to CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>. In silico surveys revealed the presence of five AQP orthologs in the pennate diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> and two in the centric diatom <i>Thalassiosira pseudonana</i>. GFP fusions of putative AQPs displayed clear localization to the plasma membrane (PtAGP1 and PtAQP2), the chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum (CER; PtAGP1 and PtAQP3), and the tonoplast (PtAQP5) in <i>P. tricornutum</i>. In <i>T. pseudonana</i>, GFP-AQP fusion proteins were found on the vacuole membrane (TpAQP1) and CER (TpAQP2). Transcript levels of both <i>PtAQP1</i> and <i>PtAQP2</i> were highly induced by ammonia, while only <i>PtAQP2</i> was induced by high (1%[v/v]) CO<sub>2</sub>. Constitutive overexpression of GFP-tagged PtAQP1 and PtAQP2 significantly increased CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> permeability in <i>P. tricornutum</i>, strongly indicating that these AQPs function in regulating CO<sub>2</sub>/NH<sub>3</sub> permeability in the plasma membrane and/or CER. Cells carrying GFP-tagged PtAQP1 and PtAQP2 had higher nonphotochemical quenching under high light relative to that of wild-type cells, suggesting that these AQPs are involved in photoprotection. These AQPs may facilitate the efflux of NH<sub>3</sub>, preventing the uncoupling effect of high intracellular ammonia concentrations.</p>

Polyamines Regulate Strawberry Fruit Ripening by Abscisic Acid, Auxin, and Ethylene<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Polyamines (PAs) participate in many plant growth and developmental processes, including fruit ripening. However, it is not clear whether PAs play a role in the ripening of strawberry (<i>Fragaria ananassa</i>), a model nonclimacteric plant. Here, we found that the content of the PA spermine (Spm) increased more sharply after the onset of fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation than did that of the PAs putrescine (Put) or spermidine (Spd). Spm dominance in ripe fruit resulted from abundant transcripts of a strawberry <i>S</i>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-Met decarboxylase gene (<i>FaSAMDC</i>), which encodes an enzyme that generates a residue needed for PA biosynthesis. Exogenous Spm and Spd promoted fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation, while exogenous Put and a SAMDC inhibitor inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. Based on transcriptome data, up- and down-regulation of <i>FaSAMDC</i> expression promoted and inhibited ripening, respectively, which coincided with changes in several physiological parameters and their corresponding gene transcripts, including firmness, anthocyanin content, sugar content, polyamine content, auxin (indole-3-acetic acid [IAA]) content, abscisic acid (ABA) content, and ethylene emission. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we found that FaSAMDC also had a high enzymatic activity with a <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 1.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup> <sc>m</sc>. In conclusion, PAs, especially Spm, regulate strawberry fruit ripening in an ABA-dominated, IAA-participating, and ethylene-coordinated manner, and FaSAMDC plays an important role in ripening.</p>

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts

The cleavable N-terminal transit peptide (TP) of chloroplast preproteins contains all the information required for import into chloroplasts through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of whether and how the physico<strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong></span></strong>es of preproteins affect TP-mediated import into chloroplasts has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient translocation through the chloroplast envelope membranes for proteins containing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or proteins prone to aggregation. By contrast, the translocation of soluble proteins through the chloroplast envelope membranes is less dependent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate protein translocation into chloroplasts; instead, these mutant TPs led to protein mistargeting to the chloroplast envelope membranes or nonspecific protein aggregation during import into chloroplasts. The mistargeting of TMD-containing proteins caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which preprotein translocation is compromised. We propose that the physico<strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong></span></strong>es of chloroplast proteins affect protein translocation through the chloroplast envelope, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient translocation of TMD-containing proteins.</p>

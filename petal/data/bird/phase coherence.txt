Second-scale nuclear spin coherence time of ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K molecules
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence, the stability of the relative phase between quantum states, is central to quantum mechanics and its applications. For ultracold dipolar molecules at sub-microkelvin temperatures, internal states with robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence are predicted to offer rich prospects for quantum many-body physics and quantum information processing. We report the observation of stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence between nuclear spin states of ultracold fermionic sodium-potassium (NaK) molecules in the singlet rovibrational ground state. Ramsey spectroscopy reveals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence times on the scale of 1 second; this enables high-resolution spectroscopy of the molecular gas. Collisional shifts are shown to be absent down to the 100-millihertz level. This work opens the door to the use of molecules as a versatile quantum memory and for precision measurements on dipolar quantum matter.</p>

Observation of an environmentally insensitive solid-state spin defect in diamond

Color centers in diamond are a promising approach, with the potential to combine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence of atoms with the scalability of a solid-state platform. We report a color center that shows insensitivity to environmental de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence caused by phonons and electric field noise: the neutral charge state of silicon vacancy (SiV<sup>0</sup>). Through careful materials engineering, we achieved >80% conversion of implanted silicon to SiV<sup>0</sup>. SiV<sup>0</sup> exhibits spin-lattice relaxation times approaching 1 minute and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence times approaching 1 second. Its optical properties are very favorable, with ~90% of its emission into the zero-phonon line and near–transform-limited optical linewidths.

Coherent, atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenide superlattices with engineered strain
<p>Epitaxy forms the basis of modern electronics and optoelectronics. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent atomically thin superlattices in which different transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers—despite large lattice mismatches—are repeated and laterally integrated without dislocations within the monolayer plane. Grown by an omnidirectional epitaxy, these superlattices display fully matched lattice constants across heterointerfaces while maintaining an isotropic lattice structure and triangular symmetry. This strong epitaxial strain is precisely engineered via the nanoscale supercell dimensions, thereby enabling broad tuning of the optical properties and producing photoluminescence peak shifts as large as 250 millielectron volts. We present theoretical models to explain this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent growth and the energetic interplay governing the ripple formation in these strained monolayers. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent superlattices provide building blocks with targeted functionalities at the atomically thin limit.</p>

Coherent band excitations in CePd<sub>3</sub>: A comparison of neutron scattering and ab initio theory
<p>In common with many strongly correlated electron systems, intermediate valence compounds are believed to display a crossover from a high-temperature regime of in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ently fluctuating local moments to a low-temperature regime of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent hybridized bands. We show that inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of CePd<sub>3</sub> provides a benchmark for ab initio calculations based on dynamical mean field theory. The magnetic response is strongly momentum dependent thanks to the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent f-electron bands at low temperature, with an amplitude that is strongly enhanced by local particle-hole interactions. The agreement between experiment and theory shows that we have a robust first-principles understanding of the temperature dependence of f-electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence.</p>

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-phonon coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-phonon coupling affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.</p>

Submillihertz magnetic spectroscopy performed with a nanoscale quantum sensor
<p>Precise timekeeping is critical to metrology, forming the basis by which standards of time, length, and fundamental constants are determined. Stable clocks are particularly valuable in spectroscopy because they define the ultimate frequency precision that can be reached. In quantum metrology, the qubit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence time defines the clock stability, from which the spectral linewidth and frequency precision are determined. We demonstrate a quantum sensing protocol in which the spectral precision goes beyond the sensor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence time and is limited by the stability of a classical clock. Using this technique, we observed a precision in frequency estimation scaling in time <i>T</i> as <i>T</i><sup>–3/2</sup> for classical oscillating fields. The narrow linewidth magnetometer based on single spins in diamond is used to sense nanoscale magnetic fields with an intrinsic frequency resolution of 607 microhertz, which is eight orders of magnitude narrower than the qubit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence time.</p>

Demonstration of an ac Josephson junction laser

We use one of the fundamental aspects of superconductivity, the ac Josephson effect, to demonstrate a laser made from a Josephson junction strongly coupled to a multimode superconducting cavity. A dc voltage bias applied across the junction provides a source of microwave photons, and the circuit’s nonlinearity allows for efficient down-conversion of higher-order Josephson frequencies to the cavity’s fundamental mode. The simple fabrication and operation allows for easy integration with a range of quantum devices, allowing for efficient on-chip generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent microwave photons at low temperatures.</p>

Suppressing relaxation in superconducting qubits by quasiparticle pumping
<p>Dynamical error suppression techniques are commonly used to improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence in quantum systems. They reduce dephasing errors by applying control pulses designed to reverse erroneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent evolution driven by environmental noise. However, such methods cannot correct for irreversible processes such as energy relaxation. We investigate a complementary, stochastic approach to reducing errors: Instead of deterministically reversing the unwanted qubit evolution, we use control pulses to shape the noise environment dynamically. In the context of superconducting qubits, we implement a pumping sequence to reduce the number of unpaired electrons (quasiparticles) in close proximity to the device. A 70% reduction in the quasiparticle density results in a threefold enhancement in qubit relaxation times and a comparable reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence variability.</p>

Phylogeny-Based Systematization of Arabidopsis Proteins with Histone H1 Globular Domain
<p>H1 (or linker) histones are basic nuclear proteins that possess an evolutionarily conserved nucleosome-binding globular domain, GH1. They perform critical functions in determining the accessibility of chromatin DNA to trans-acting factors. In most metazoan species studied so far, linker histones are highly heterogenous, with numerous nonallelic variants cooccurring in the same cells. The phylogenetic relationships among these variants as well as their structural and functional properties have been relatively well established. This contrasts markedly with the rather limited knowledge concerning the phylogeny and structural and functional roles of an unusually diverse group of GH1-containing proteins in plants. The dearth of information and the lack of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent phylogeny-based nomenclature of these proteins can lead to misunderstandings regarding their identity and possible relationships, thereby hampering plant chromatin research. Based on published data and our in silico and high-throughput analyses, we propose a systematization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent nomenclature of GH1-containing proteins of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> [L.] Heynh) that will be useful for both the identification and structural and functional characterization of homologous proteins from other plant species.</p>

Chemically reversible isomerization of inorganic clusters
<p>Structural transformations in molecules and solids have generally been studied in isolation, whereas intermediate systems have eluded characterization.

The clusters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ently interconvert over an ~1–electron volt energy barrier with a 140–milli–electron volt shift in their excitonic energy gaps. There is a diffusionless, displacive reconfiguration of the inorganic core (solid-solid transformation) with first order (isomerization-like) transformation kinetics. Driven by a distortion of the ligand-binding motifs, the presence of hydroxyl species changes the surface energy via physisorption, which determines “phase” stability in this system. This reaction possesses essential characteristics of both solid-solid transformations and molecular isomerizations and bridges these disparate length scales.</p>

The Little Ice Age and 20th-century deep Pacific cooling

The long memory of the ocean suggests that these historical surface anomalies are associated with ongoing deep-ocean temperature adjustments. Combining an ocean model with modern and paleoceanographic data leads to a prediction that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to the cooling going into the Little Ice Age, whereas temperature trends in the surface ocean and deep Atlantic reflect modern warming. This prediction is corroborated by temperature changes identified between the HMS Challenger expedition of the 1870s and modern hydrography. The implied heat loss in the deep ocean since 1750 CE offsets one-fourth of the global heat gain in the upper ocean.</p>

Quantum metasurface for multiphoton interference and state reconstruction

Observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent elastic scattering of neutrinos off nuclei has eluded detection for four decades, even though its predicted cross section is by far the largest of all low-energy neutrino couplings. This mode of interaction offers new opportunities to study neutrino properties and leads to a miniaturization of detector size, with potential technological applications. We observed this process at a 6.7σ confidence level, using a low-background, 14.6-kilogram CsI[Na] scintillator exposed to the neutrino emissions from the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Characteristic signatures in energy and time, predicted by the standard model for this process, were observed in high signal-to-background conditions. Improved constraints on nonstandard neutrino interactions with quarks are derived from this initial data set.</p>

Two-dimensional sp<sup>2</sup> carbon–conjugated covalent organic frameworks
<p>We synthesized a two-dimensional (2D) crystalline covalent organic framework (sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF) that was designed to be fully π-conjugated and constructed from all sp<sup>2</sup> carbons by C=C condensation reactions of tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene and 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile. The C=C linkages topologically connect pyrene knots at regular intervals into a 2D lattice with π conjugations extended along both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions and develop an eclipsed layer framework rather than the more conventionally obtained disordered structures. The sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF is a semiconductor with a discrete band gap of 1.9 electron volts and can be chemically oxidized to enhance conductivity by 12 orders of magnitude. The generated radicals are confined on the pyrene knots, enabling the formation of a paramagnetic carbon structure with high spin density. The sp<sup>2</sup> carbon framework induces ferromagnetic phase transition to develop spin-spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence and align spins unidirectionally across the material.</p>

Coherent imaging of an attosecond electron wave packet
<p>Electrons detached from atoms or molecules by photoionization carry information about the quantum state from which they originate, as well as the continuum states into which they are released. Generally, the photoelectron momentum distribution is composed of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent sum of angular momentum components, each with an amplitude and phase. Here we show, by using photoionization of neon, that a train of attosecond pulses synchronized with an infrared laser field can be used to disentangle these angular momentum components. Two-color, two-photon ionization via a Stark-shifted intermediate state creates an almost pure f-wave with a magnetic quantum number of zero. Interference of the f-wave with a spherically symmetric s-wave provides a holographic reference that enables phase-resolved imaging of the f-wave.</p>

Bragg coherent diffractive imaging of single-grain defect dynamics in polycrystalline films
<p>Polycrystalline material properties depend on the distribution and interactions of their crystalline grains. In particular, grain boundaries and defects are crucial in determining their response to external stimuli. A long-standing challenge is thus to observe individual grains, defects, and strain dynamics inside functional materials. Here we report a technique capable of revealing grain heterogeneity, including strain fields and individual dislocations, that can be used under operando conditions in reactive environments: grain Bragg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent diffractive imaging (gBCDI). Using a polycrystalline gold thin film subjected to heating, we show how gBCDI resolves grain boundary and dislocation dynamics in individual grains in three-dimensional detail with 10-nanometer spatial and subangstrom displacement field resolution. These results pave the way for understanding polycrystalline material response under external stimuli and, ideally, engineering particular functions.</p>

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation
<p>The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear optical responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear optical processes is high-harmonic generation (HHG) originating from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent electron motion induced by an intense light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in graphene excited by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser excitation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions.</p>

Transition from turbulent to coherent flows in confined three-dimensional active fluids
<p>Transport of fluid through a pipe is essential for the operation of macroscale machines and microfluidic devices. Conventional fluids only flow in response to external pressure. We demonstrate that an active isotropic fluid, composed of microtubules and molecular motors, autonomously flows through meter-long three-dimensional channels. We establish control over the magnitude, velocity profile, and direction of the self-organized flows and correlate these to the structure of the extensile microtubule bundles. The inherently three-dimensional transition from bulk-turbulent to confined-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent flows occurs concomitantly with a transition in the bundle orientational order near the surface and is controlled by a scale-invariant criterion related to the channel profile. The nonequilibrium transition of confined isotropic active fluids can be used to engineer self-organized soft machines.</p>

Large, valley-exclusive Bloch-Siegert shift in monolayer WS<sub>2</sub>
<p>Coherent interaction with off-resonance light can be used to shift the energy levels of atoms, molecules, and solids. The dominant effect is the optical Stark shift, but there is an additional contribution from the so-called Bloch-Siegert shift that has eluded direct and exclusive observation in solids. We observed an exceptionally large Bloch-Siegert shift in monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) under infrared optical driving. By controlling the light helicity, we could confine the Bloch-Siegert shift to occur only at one valley, and the optical Stark shift at the other valley, because the two effects obey opposite selection rules at different valleys. Such a large and valley-exclusive Bloch-Siegert shift allows for enhanced control over the valleytronic properties of two-dimensional materials.</p>

Using Ramsey interferometry, we studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent evolution of the resonantly interacting Bose gas, and we show here that it cannot be explained by only pairwise correlations.

Strong coupling of a single electron in silicon to a microwave photon

Isotopic purification has enabled quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence times on the order of seconds, thereby placing silicon at the forefront of efforts to create a solid-state quantum processor. We demonstrate strong coupling of a single electron in a silicon double quantum dot to the photonic field of a microwave cavity, as shown by the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting. Strong coupling of a quantum dot electron to a cavity photon would allow for long-range qubit coupling and the long-range entanglement of electrons in semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom
<p>Integrated nonreciprocal optical components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagation direction, are key for routing signals in photonic circuits. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum optical circulator operated by a single atom. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interaction between the atom and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the atom controls the operation direction of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level. This enables, for example, photon number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable integrated optical circuits.</p>

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The dynamics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of wave packets. However, the rapidity of electron dynamics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of electron wave packets in the time domain. Using spectrally resolved electron interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photoelectron wave packet created through a Fano autoionizing resonance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference wave packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant wave packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing resonance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission dynamics governed by electron correlation, as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent control over structured electron wave packets.</p>

A coherent Ising machine for 2000-node optimization problems
<p>The analysis and optimization of complex systems can be reduced to mathematical problems collectively known as combinatorial optimization. Many such problems can be mapped onto ground-state search problems of the Ising model, and various artificial spin systems are now emerging as promising approaches. However, physical Ising machines have suffered from limited numbers of spin-spin couplings because of implementations based on localized spins, resulting in severe scalability problems. We report a 2000-spin network with all-to-all spin-spin couplings. Using a measurement and feedback scheme, we coupled time-multiplexed degenerate optical parametric oscillators to implement maximum cut problems on arbitrary graph topologies with up to 2000 nodes. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent Ising machine outperformed simulated annealing in terms of accuracy and computation time for a 2000-node complete graph.</p>

Microresonator soliton dual-comb spectroscopy
<p>Measurement of optical and vibrational spectra with high resolution provides a way to identify chemical species in cluttered environments and is of general importance in many fields. Dual-comb spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful approach for acquiring nearly instantaneous Raman and optical spectra with unprecedented resolution. Spectra are generated directly in the electrical domain, without the need for bulky mechanical spectrometers. We demonstrate a miniature soliton-based dual-comb system that can potentially transfer the approach to a chip platform. These devices achieve high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence pulsed mode locking. They also feature broad, reproducible spectral envelopes, an essential feature for dual-comb spectroscopy. Our work shows the potential for integrated spectroscopy with high signal-to-noise ratios and fast acquisition rates.</p>

Multisite phosphorylation by MAPK
<p>Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in signal transduction networks. Phosphorylation alters protein function by regulating enzymatic activity, stability, cellular localization, or binding partners. Over three-quarters of human proteins may be phosphorylated, with many targeted at multiple sites. Such multisite phosphorylation substantially increases the scope for modulating protein function—a protein with <i>n</i> phosphorylation sites has the potential to exist in 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> distinct phosphorylation states, each of which could, in theory, display modified functionality. Proteins can be substrates for several protein kinases, thereby integrating distinct signals to provide a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent biological response. However, they can also be phosphorylated at multiple sites by a single protein kinase to promote a specific functional output that can be reversed by dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases. On page 233 of this issue, Mylona <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal an unexpected role for multisite phosphorylation, whereby a protein kinase progressively phosphorylates sites on a transcription factor to promote and then subsequently limit its activity independently of dephosphorylation.</p>

A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring diagram of cellular function
<p>We generated a global genetic interaction network for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive network maps genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent sets of genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.</p>

Evidence for the Regulation of Gynoecium Morphogenesis by <i>ETTIN</i> via Cell Wall Dynamics
<p><i>ETTIN</i> (<i>ETT</i>) is an atypical member of the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR family of transcription factors that plays a crucial role in tissue patterning in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium. Though recent insights have provided valuable information on ETT’s interactions with other components of auxin signaling, the biophysical mechanisms linking ETT to its ultimate effects on gynoecium morphology were until now unknown. Here, using techniques to assess cell-wall dynamics during gynoecium growth and development, we provide a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent body of evidence to support a model in which ETT controls the elongation of the valve tissues of the gynoecium through the positive regulation of pectin methylesterase (PME) activity in the cell wall. This increase in PME activity results in an increase in the level of demethylesterified pectins and a consequent reduction in cell wall stiffness, leading to elongation of the valves. Though similar biophysical mechanisms have been shown to act in the stem apical meristem, leading to the expansion of organ primordia, our findings demonstrate that regulation of cell wall stiffness through the covalent modification of pectin also contributes to tissue patterning within a developing plant organ.</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural selection, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural selection on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. It obtains information about divergence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and divergence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.</p>

Extracellular Matrix Proteomics Reveals Interplay of Aggrecan and Aggrecanases in Vascular Remodeling of Stented Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling contributes to in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Despite its important clinical implications, little is known about ECM changes post–stent implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Bare-metal and drug-eluting stents were implanted in pig coronary arteries with an overstretch under optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence tomography guidance. Stented segments were harvested 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-stenting for proteomics analysis of the media and neointima.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 151 ECM and ECM-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. After stent implantation, proteins involved in regulating calcification were upregulated in the neointima of drug-eluting stents. The earliest changes in the media were proteins involved in inflammation and thrombosis, followed by changes in regulatory ECM proteins. By day 28, basement membrane proteins were reduced in drug-eluting stents in comparison with bare-metal stents. In contrast, the large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was increased. Aggrecanases of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family contribute to the catabolism of vascular proteoglycans. An increase in ADAMTS-specific aggrecan fragments was accompanied by a notable shift from <i>ADAMTS1</i> and <i>ADAMTS5</i> to <i>ADAMTS4</i> gene expression after stent implantation. Immunostaining in human stented coronary arteries confirmed the presence of aggrecan and aggrecan fragments, in particular, at the contacts of the stent struts with the artery. Further investigation of aggrecan presence in the human vasculature revealed that aggrecan and aggrecan cleavage were more abundant in human arteries than in human veins. In addition, aggrecan synthesis was induced on grafting a vein into the arterial circulation, suggesting an important role for aggrecan in vascular plasticity. Finally, lack of ADAMTS-5 activity in mice resulted in an accumulation of aggrecan and a dilation of the thoracic aorta, confirming that aggrecanase activity regulates aggrecan abundance in the arterial wall and contributes to vascular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant differences were identified by proteomics in the ECM of coronary arteries after bare-metal and drug-eluting stent implantation, most notably an upregulation of aggrecan, a major ECM component of cartilaginous tissues that confers resistance to compression. The accumulation of aggrecan coincided with a shift in <i>ADAMTS</i> gene expression. This study provides the first evidence implicating aggrecan and aggrecanases in the vascular injury response after stenting.</p></sec>

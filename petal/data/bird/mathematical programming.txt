Cash for carbon: A randomized trial of payments for ecosystem services to reduce deforestation
<p>We evaluated a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> of payments for ecosystem services in Uganda that offered forest-owning households annual payments of 70,000 Ugandan shillings per hectare if they conserved their forest. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> was implemented as a randomized controlled trial in 121 villages, 60 of which received the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in land area covered by trees, measured by classifying high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that tree cover declined by 4.2% during the study period in treatment villages, compared to 9.1% in control villages. We found no evidence that enrollees shifted their deforestation to nearby land. We valued the delayed carbon dioxide emissions and found that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> benefit is 2.4 times as large as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> costs.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of the Arabidopsis Replication Timing Program
<p>Eukaryotes use a temporally regulated process, known as the replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>, to ensure that their genomes are fully and accurately duplicated during S phase. Replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s are predictive of genomic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of chromatin organization. Although replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to genome sequence and chromatin structure. We used the thymidine analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the genome-wide replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified genomic regions that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and correlated these regions with genomic features and with data for chromatin state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis chromosome arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric regions replicate late. Early and mid-replicating regions are gene-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late regions are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of chromatin states across the different times is complex, with each replication time corresponding to a mixture of states. Early and mid-replicating sequences interact with each other and not with late sequences, but early regions are more accessible than mid regions. The replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite genomic organization with early/mid-replicating regions and late regions forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated largely by chromatin accessibility.</p>

SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE1 Links DNA Damage Response to Organ Regeneration
<p>In Arabidopsis, DNA damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death is limited to the meristematic stem cell niche and its early descendants. The significance of this cell-type-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death is unclear. Here, we demonstrate in roots that it is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med destruction of the mitotically compromised stem cell niche that triggers its regeneration, enabling growth recovery. In contrast to wild-type plants, <i>sog1</i> plants, which are defective in damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death, maintain the cell identities and stereotypical structure of the stem cell niche after irradiation, but these cells fail to undergo cell division, terminating root growth. We propose DNA damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death is employed by plants as a developmental response, contrasting with its role as an anticarcinogenic response in animals. This role in plants may have evolved to restore the growth of embryos after the accumulation of DNA damage in seeds.</p>

Reconfigurable system for automated optimization of diverse chemical reactions
<p>Chemical synthesis generally requires labor-intensive, sometimes tedious trial-and-error <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ization of reaction conditions. Here, we describe a plug-and-play, continuous-flow chemical synthesis system that mitigates this challenge with an integrated combination of hardware, software, and analytics. The system software controls the user-selected reagents and unit operations (reactors and separators), processes reaction analytics (high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, vibrational spectroscopy), and conducts automated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>izations. The capabilities of this system are demonstrated in high-yielding implementations of C-C and C-N cross-coupling, olefination, reductive amination, nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S<sub>N</sub>Ar), photoredox catalysis, and a multistep sequence. The graphical user interface enables users to initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>izations, monitor progress remotely, and analyze results. Subsequent users of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ized procedure need only download an electronic file, comparable to a smartphone application, to implement the protocol on their own apparatus.</p>

Human-in-the-loop optimization of exoskeleton assistance during walking

Suboptimal Acclimation of Photosynthesis to Light in Wheat Canopies<sup>[CC-BY]</sup>
<p>Photosynthetic acclimation (photoacclimation) is the process whereby leaves alter their morphology and/or biochemistry to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ize photosynthetic efficiency and productivity according to long-term changes in the light environment. The three-dimensional architecture of plant canopies imposes complex light dynamics, but the drivers for photoacclimation in such fluctuating environments are poorly understood. A technique for high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction was combined with ray tracing to simulate a daily time course of radiation profiles for architecturally contrasting field-grown wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) canopies. An empirical model of photoacclimation was adapted to predict the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al distribution of photosynthesis according to the fluctuating light patterns throughout the canopies. While the photoacclimation model output showed good correlation with field-measured gas-exchange data at the top of the canopy, it predicted a lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al light-saturated rate of photosynthesis at the base. Leaf Rubisco and protein contents were consistent with the measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al light-saturated rate of photosynthesis. We conclude that, although the photosynthetic capacity of leaves is high enough to exploit brief periods of high light within the canopy (particularly toward the base), the frequency and duration of such sunflecks are too small to make acclimation a viable strategy in terms of carbon gain. This sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al acclimation renders a large portion of residual photosynthetic capacity unused and reduces photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency at the canopy level, with further implications for photosynthetic productivity. It is argued that (1) this represents an untapped source of photosynthetic potential and (2) canopy nitrogen could be lowered with no detriment to carbon gain or grain protein content.</p>

Multicellular Transcriptional Analysis of Mammalian Heart Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The inability of the adult mammalian heart to regenerate following injury represents a major barrier in cardiovascular medicine. In contrast, the neonatal mammalian heart retains a transient capacity for regeneration, which is lost shortly after birth. Defining the molecular mechanisms that govern regenerative capacity in the neonatal period remains a central goal in cardiac biology. Here, we assemble a transcriptomic framework of multiple cardiac cell populations during postnatal development and following injury, which enables comparative analyses of the regenerative (neonatal) versus nonregenerative (adult) state for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, leukocytes, and endothelial cells from infarcted and noninfarcted neonatal (P1) and adult (P56) mouse hearts were isolated by enzymatic dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting at day 3 following surgery. RNA sequencing was performed on these cell populations to generate the transcriptome of the major cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. To complement our transcriptomic data, we also surveyed the epigenetic landscape of cardiomyocytes during postnatal maturation by performing deep sequencing of accessible chromatin regions by using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin from purified mouse cardiomyocyte nuclei (P1, P14, and P56).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Profiling of cardiomyocyte and nonmyocyte transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s uncovered several injury-responsive genes across regenerative and nonregenerative time points.

Furthermore, adult leukocytes and fibroblasts were characterized by the expression of a proliferative gene expression network following infarction, which mirrored the neonatal state.

<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Geospatial methods using mathematical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ization to identify clusters of cardiac arrests and prioritize public locations for defibrillator deployment have not been studied. Our objective was to develop such a method and test its performance against a population-guided approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>All public location cardiac arrests in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from December 16, 2005, to July 15, 2010, and all automated external defibrillator (AED) locations registered with Toronto Emergency Medical Services as of September 2009 were plotted geographically. Current AED coverage was quantified by determining the number of cardiac arrests occurring within 100 m of a registered AED. Clusters of cardiac arrests without a registered AED within 100 m were identified. With the use of mathematical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ization techniques, cardiac arrest coverage improvements were computed and shown to be superior to results from a population-guided deployment method. There were 1310 eligible public location cardiac arrests and 1669 registered AEDs. Of the eligible cardiac arrests, 304 were within 100 m of at least 1 registered AED (23% coverage). The average distance from a cardiac arrest to the closest AED was 281 m.

TSLP signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells programs a pathogenic T helper 2 cell state
<p>Pathogenic T helper 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) cells, which produce increased amounts of the cytokines interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13, promote allergic disorders, including asthma. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine secreted by epithelial and innate immune cells, stimulates such pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 cell responses. We found that TSLP signaling in mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells initiated transcriptional changes associated with T<sub>H</sub>2 cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ming. IL-4 signaling amplified and stabilized the genomic response of T cells to TSLP, which increased the frequency of T cells producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Furthermore, the TSLP- and IL-4–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med T<sub>H</sub>2 cells had a pathogenic phenotype, producing greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 and other proinflammatory cytokines than did T<sub>H</sub>2 cells stimulated with IL-4 alone. TSLP-mediated T<sub>H</sub>2 cell induction involved distinct molecular pathways, including activation of the transcription factor STAT5 through the kinase JAK2 and repression of the transcription factor BCL6. Mice that received wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had exacerbated pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 cell responses upon exposure to house dust mites compared to mice that received TSLP receptor–deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

In human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, TSLP and IL-4 promoted the generation of T<sub>H</sub>2 cells that produced greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13. Compared to healthy controls, asthmatic children showed enhancement of such T cell responses in peripheral blood. Our data support a sequential cytokine model for pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 cell differentiation and provide a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic targeting of TSLP signaling in human allergic diseases.</p>

A compact synthetic pathway rewires cancer signaling to therapeutic effector release
<p>An important goal in synthetic biology is to engineer biochemical pathways to address unsolved biomedical problems. One long-standing problem in molecular medicine is the specific identification and ablation of cancer cells. Here, we describe a method, named Rewiring of Aberrant Signaling to Effector Release (RASER), in which oncogenic ErbB receptor activity, instead of being targeted for inhibition as in existing treatments, is co-opted to trigger therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s. RASER integrates ErbB activity to specifically link oncogenic states to the execution of desired outputs. A complete mathematical model of RASER and modularity in design enable rational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ization and output <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ming. Using RASER, we induced apoptosis and CRISPR-Cas9–mediated transcription of endogenous genes specifically in ErbB-hyperactive cancer cells. Delivery of apoptotic RASER by adeno-associated virus selectively ablated ErbB-hyperactive cancer cells while sparing ErbB-normal cells. RASER thus provides a new strategy for oncogene-specific cancer detection and treatment.</p>

Commensal-specific T cell plasticity promotes rapid tissue adaptation to injury
<p>Barrier tissues are primary targets of environmental stressors and are home to the largest number of antigen-experienced lymphocytes in the body, including commensal-specific T cells.

Thus, in the context of injury and exposure to inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-18, these cells rapidly release type 2 cytokines, thereby acquiring contextual functions. Such acquisition of a type 2 effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> promotes tissue repair. Aberrant type 2 responses can also be unleashed in the context of local defects in immunoregulation.

LTR_retriever: A Highly Accurate and Sensitive Program for Identification of Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons
<p>Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are prevalent in plant genomes. The identification of LTR-RTs is critical for achieving high-quality gene annotation. Based on the well-conserved structure, multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s were developed for the de novo identification of LTR-RTs; however, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s are associated with low specificity and high false discovery rates. Here, we report LTR_retriever, a multithreading-empowered Perl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> that identifies LTR-RTs and generates high-quality LTR libraries from genomic sequences. LTR_retriever demonstrated significant improvements by achieving high levels of sensitivity (91%), specificity (97%), accuracy (96%), and precision (90%) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). LTR_retriever is also compatible with long sequencing reads. With 40k self-corrected PacBio reads equivalent to 4.5× genome coverage in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the constructed LTR library showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. In addition to canonical LTR-RTs with 5′-TG…CA-3′ termini, LTR_retriever also identifies noncanonical LTR-RTs (non-TGCA), which have been largely ignored in genome-wide studies. We identified seven types of noncanonical LTRs from 42 out of 50 plant genomes. The majority of noncanonical LTRs are <i>Copia</i> elements, with which the LTR is four times shorter than that of other <i>Copia</i> elements, which may be a result of their target specificity. Strikingly, non-TGCA <i>Copia</i> elements are often located in genic regions and preferentially insert nearby or within genes, indicating their impact on the evolution of genes and their potential as mutagenesis tools.</p>

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct vegetative and zygotic wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

Diversification of Root Hair Development Genes in Vascular Plants

To understand the extent to which this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> might operate in other plants, we conducted a large-scale comparative analysis of root hair development genes from diverse vascular plants, including eudicots, monocots, and a lycophyte. Combining phylogenetics and transcriptomics, we discovered conservation of a core set of root hair genes across all vascular plants, which may derive from an ancient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for unidirectional cell growth coopted for root hair development during vascular plant evolution. Interestingly, we also discovered preferential diversification in the structure and expression of root hair development genes, relative to other root hair- and root-expressed genes, among these species. These differences enabled the definition of sets of genes and gene functions that were acquired or lost in specific lineages during vascular plant evolution. In particular, we found substantial divergence in the structure and expression of genes used for root hair patterning, suggesting that the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not shared by other species. To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive view of gene expression in a single plant cell type across multiple species.</p>

Optimization of Light-Harvesting Pigment Improves Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>Maximizing light capture by light-harvesting pigment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ization represents an attractive but challenging strategy to improve photosynthetic efficiency. Here, we report that loss of a previously uncharacterized gene, <i>HIGH PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY1</i> (<i>HPE1</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>izes light-harvesting pigments, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>hpe1</i> mutants show faster electron transport and increased contents of carbohydrates. <i>HPE1</i> encodes a chloroplast protein containing an RNA recognition motif that directly associates with and regulates the splicing of target RNAs of plastid genes. HPE1 also interacts with other plastid RNA-splicing factors, including CAF1 and OTP51, which share common targets with HPE1. Deficiency of HPE1 alters the expression of nucleus-encoded chlorophyll-related genes, probably through plastid-to-nucleus signaling, causing decreased total content of chlorophyll (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>) in a limited range but increased chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> ratio. Interestingly, this adjustment of light-harvesting pigment reduces antenna size, improves light capture, decreases energy loss, mitigates photodamage, and enhances photosynthetic quantum yield during photosynthesis. Our findings suggest a novel strategy to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ize light-harvesting pigments that improves photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production in higher plants.</p>

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion pattern (optic flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of optic flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as optic flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant optic flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of optic flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

The Optimal Timing of Stage 2 Palliation for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome

Factors associated with death or heart transplantation were determined for each interval. To account for staged procedures, risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood TFS (the probability of TFS at 3 years given survival to S2P) was calculated using parametric conditional survival analysis.

Histone Methyltransferase G9a Is Required for Cardiomyocyte Homeostasis and Hypertrophy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Correct gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ming of the cardiomyocyte underlies the normal functioning of the heart. Alterations to this can lead to the loss of cardiac homeostasis, triggering heart dysfunction. Although the role of some histone methyltransferases in establishing the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> of postnatal cardiomyocytes during heart development has been shown, the function of this class of epigenetic enzymes is largely unexplored in the adult heart. In this study, we investigated the role of G9a/Ehmt2, a histone methyltransferase that defines a repressive epigenetic signature, in defining the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for cardiomyocyte homeostasis and cardiac hypertrophy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the function of G9a in normal and stressed cardiomyocytes with the use of a conditional, cardiac-specific G9a knockout mouse, a specific G9a inhibitor, and high-throughput approaches for the study of the epigenome (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) and transcriptome (RNA sequencing); traditional methods were used to assess cardiac function and cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that G9a is required for cardiomyocyte homeostasis in the adult heart by mediating the repression of key genes regulating cardiomyocyte function via dimethylation of H3 lysine 9 and interaction with enhancer of zeste homolog 2, the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2, and MEF2C-dependent gene expression by forming a complex with this transcription factor. The G9a-MEF2C complex was found to be required also for the maintenance of heterochromatin needed for the silencing of developmental genes in the adult heart. Moreover, G9a promoted cardiac hypertrophy by repressing antihypertrophic genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Taken together, our findings demonstrate that G9a orchestrates critical epigenetic changes in cardiomyocytes in physiological and pathological conditions, thereby providing novel therapeutic avenues for cardiac pathologies associated with dysregulation of these mechanisms.</p></sec>

Optimizing a Drone Network to Deliver Automated External Defibrillators
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Public access defibrillation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s can improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are rarely available for bystander use at the scene. Drones are an emerging technology that can deliver an AED to the scene of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for bystander use. We hypothesize that a drone network designed with the aid of a mathematical model combining both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ization and queuing can reduce the time to AED arrival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied our model to 53 702 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred in the 8 regions of the Toronto Regional RescuNET between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2014. Our primary analysis quantified the drone network size required to deliver an AED 1, 2, or 3 minutes faster than historical median 911 response times for each region independently. A secondary analysis quantified the reduction in drone resources required if RescuNET was treated as a large coordinated region.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The region-specific analysis determined that 81 bases and 100 drones would be required to deliver an AED ahead of median 911 response times by 3 minutes. In the most urban region, the 90th percentile of the AED arrival time was reduced by 6 minutes and 43 seconds relative to historical 911 response times in the region. In the most rural region, the 90th percentile was reduced by 10 minutes and 34 seconds.

AAA-specific mortality data were retrieved from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. A linear regression analysis was used to estimate the effect on AAA-specific mortality among all men ≥65 years of age for the observed time period. The long-term effects were projected by using a validated Markov model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 302 957 men aged 65 years invited, 84% attended. The prevalence of screening-detected AAA was 1.5%. After a mean of 4.5 years, 29% of patients with AAA had been operated on, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9% (1.3% after open repair and 0.3% after endovascular repair, <i>P</i><0.001). The introduction of screening was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-specific mortality (mean, 4.0% per year of screening, <i>P</i>=0.020).

We assessed the effects of childhood obesity prevention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s on BP in children in developed countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We searched databases up to April 22, 2013, for relevant randomized, controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and natural experiments. Studies were included if they applied a diet or physical activity intervention(s) and were followed for ≥1 year (or ≥6 months for school-based intervention studies); they were excluded if they targeted only overweight/obese subjects or those with a medical condition. In our meta-analysis, intervention effects were calculated for systolic BP and diastolic BP with the use of weighted random-effects models. Of the 23 included intervention studies (involving 18 925 participants), 21 involved a school setting. Our meta-analysis included 19 studies reporting on systolic BP and 18 on diastolic BP. The pooled intervention effect was −1.64 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −2.56 to −0.71; <i>P</i>=0.001) for systolic BP and −1.44 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −2.28 to −0.60; <i>P</i>=0.001) for diastolic BP. The combined diet and physical activity interventions led to a significantly greater reduction in both systolic BP and diastolic BP than the diet-only or physical activity–only intervention. Thirteen interventions (46%) had a similar effect on both adiposity-related outcomes and BP, whereas 11 interventions (39%) showed a significant desirable effect on BP but not on adiposity-related outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Obesity prevention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s have a moderate effect on reducing BP, and those targeting both diet and physical activity seem to be more effective.</p></sec>

Drag, but not buoyancy, affects swim speed in captive Steller sea lions
<p>Swimming at an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al speed is critical for breath-hold divers seeking to maximize the time they can spend foraging underwater. Theoretical studies have predicted that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al swim speed for an animal while transiting to and from depth is independent of buoyancy, but is dependent on drag and metabolic rate. However, this prediction has never been experimentally tested. Our study assessed the effects of buoyancy and drag on the swim speed of three captive Steller sea lions (<i>Eumetopias jubatus</i>) that made 186 dives. Our study animals were trained to dive to feed at fixed depths (10–50 m) under artificially controlled buoyancy and drag conditions. Buoyancy and drag were manipulated using a pair of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes attached to harnesses worn by the sea lions, and buoyancy conditions were designed to fall within the natural range of wild animals (∼12–26% subcutaneous fat). Drag conditions were changed with and without the PVC tubes, and swim speeds were recorded and compared during descent and ascent phases using an accelerometer attached to the harnesses. Generalized linear mixed-effect models with the animal as the random variable and five explanatory variables (body mass, buoyancy, dive depth, dive phase, and drag) showed that swim speed was best predicted by two variables, drag and dive phase (AIC = −139). Consistent with a previous theoretical prediction, the results of our study suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al swim speed of Steller sea lions is a function of drag, and is independent of dive depth and buoyancy.</p>

Aging increases cell-to-cell transcriptional variability upon immune stimulation
<p>Aging is characterized by progressive loss of physiological and cellular functions, but the molecular basis of this decline remains unclear. We explored how aging affects transcriptional dynamics using single-cell RNA sequencing of unstimulated and stimulated naive and effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from young and old mice from two divergent species. In young animals, immunological activation drives a conserved transcriptomic switch, resulting in tightly controlled gene expression characterized by a strong up-regulation of a core activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>, coupled with a decrease in cell-to-cell variability. Aging perturbed the activation of this core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> and increased expression heterogeneity across populations of cells in both species. These discoveries suggest that increased cell-to-cell transcriptional variability will be a hallmark feature of aging across most, if not all, mammalian tissues.</p>

A coherent Ising machine for 2000-node optimization problems

Many such problems can be mapped onto ground-state search problems of the Ising model, and various artificial spin systems are now emerging as promising approaches. However, physical Ising machines have suffered from limited numbers of spin-spin couplings because of implementations based on localized spins, resulting in severe scalability problems. We report a 2000-spin network with all-to-all spin-spin couplings. Using a measurement and feedback scheme, we coupled time-multiplexed degenerate optical parametric oscillators to implement maximum cut problems on arbitrary graph topologies with up to 2000 nodes. Our coherent Ising machine outperformed simulated annealing in terms of accuracy and computation time for a 2000-node complete graph.</p>

The impact of training informal health care providers in India: A randomized controlled trial
<p>Health care providers without formal medical qualifications provide more than 70% of all primary care in rural India.

We report on a randomized controlled trial assessing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> that provided 72 sessions of training over 9 months to 152 informal providers (out of 304). Using standardized patients (“mystery clients”), we assessed clinical practice for three different conditions to which both providers and trainers were blinded during the intervention, representative of the range of conditions that these providers normally diagnose and treat. Training increased correct case management by 7.9 percentage points (14.2%) but did not affect the use of unnecessary medicines and antibiotics. At a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> cost of $175 per trainee, our results suggest that multitopic medical training offers an effective short-run strategy to improve health care.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse polar behaviors in response to directional and nondirectional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic behaviors is well understood, but it is less well understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the polarity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med polarity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in polarization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf polarity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and polar transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of polar auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in plants under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> plants displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type plants; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> plants also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed chlorophyll degradation. Furthermore, under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al conditions, <i>fa</i> plant seed production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> seed yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type seed and no reduction in <i>fa</i> seed. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing plants to accumulate biomass and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and plant biomass combined with delayed chlorophyll degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

A Simple Method for Measuring Apoplast Hydration and Collecting Apoplast Contents
<p>The plant leaf apoplast is a dynamic environment subject to a variety of both internal and external stimuli. In addition to being a conduit for water vapor and gas exchange involved in transpiration and photosynthesis, the apoplast also accumulates many nutrients transported from the soil as well as those produced through photosynthesis. The internal leaf also provides a protective environment for endophytic and pathogenic microbes alike. Given the diverse array of physiological processes occurring in the apoplast, it is expedient to develop methods to study its contents. Many established methods rely on vacuum infiltration of an apoplast wash solution followed by centrifugation. In this study, we describe a refined method <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ized for maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seedling leaves, which not only provides a simple procedure for obtaining apoplast fluid, but also allows direct calculation of apoplast hydration at the time of harvest for every sample. In addition, we describe an abbreviated method for estimating apoplast hydration if the full apoplast extraction is not necessary. Finally, we show the applicability of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ized apoplast extraction procedure for plants infected with the maize pathogen <i>Pantoea stewartii</i> ssp <i>stewartii</i>, including the efficient isolation of bacteria previously residing in the apoplast. The approaches to establishing this method should make it generally applicable to other types of plants.</p>

A Program for Iron Economy during Deficiency Targets Specific Fe Proteins
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plants, utilized in nearly every cellular process. Because the adjustment of uptake under Fe limitation cannot satisfy all demands, plants need to acclimate their physiology and biochemistry, especially in their chloroplasts, which have a high demand for Fe. To investigate if a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> exists for the utilization of Fe under deficiency, we analyzed how hydroponically grown Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) adjusts its physiology and Fe protein composition in vegetative photosynthetic tissue during Fe deficiency. Fe deficiency first affected photosynthetic electron transport with concomitant reductions in carbon assimilation and biomass production when effects on respiration were not yet significant. Photosynthetic electron transport function and protein levels of Fe-dependent enzymes were fully recovered upon Fe resupply, indicating that the Fe depletion stress did not cause irreversible secondary damage. At the protein level, ferredoxin, the cytochrome-<i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, and Fe-containing enzymes of the plastid sulfur assimilation pathway were major targets of Fe deficiency, whereas other Fe-dependent functions were relatively less affected. In coordination, SufA and SufB, two proteins of the plastid Fe-sulfur cofactor assembly pathway, were also diminished early by Fe depletion. Iron depletion reduced mRNA levels for the majority of the affected proteins, indicating that loss of enzyme was not just due to lack of Fe cofactors. SufB and ferredoxin were early targets of transcript down-regulation. The data reveal a hierarchy for Fe utilization in photosynthetic tissue and indicate that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> is in place to acclimate to impending Fe deficiency.</p>

Selinene Volatiles Are Essential Precursors for Maize Defense Promoting Fungal Pathogen Resistance
<p>To ensure food security, maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a model crop for understanding useful traits underlying stress resistance. In contrast to foliar biochemicals, root defenses limiting the spread of disease remain poorly described. To better understand belowground defenses in the field, we performed root metabolomic profiling and uncovered unexpectedly high levels of the sesquiterpene volatile β-selinene and the corresponding nonvolatile antibiotic derivative β-costic acid. The application of metabolite-based quantitative trait locus mapping using biparental populations, genome-wide association studies, and near-isogenic lines enabled the identification of terpene synthase21 (<i>ZmTps21</i>) on chromosome 9 as a β-costic acid pathway candidate gene. Numerous closely examined β-costic acid-deficient inbred lines were found to harbor <i>Zmtps21</i> pseudogenes lacking conserved motifs required for farnesyl diphosphate cyclase activity. For biochemical validation, a full-length <i>ZmTps21</i> was cloned, heterologously expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and demonstrated to cyclize farnesyl diphosphate, yielding β-selinene as the dominant product. Consistent with microbial defense pathways, <i>ZmTps21</i> transcripts strongly accumulate following fungal elicitation. Challenged field roots containing functional <i>ZmTps21</i> alleles displayed β-costic acid levels over 100 μg g<sup>−1</sup> fresh weight, greatly exceeding in vitro concentrations required to inhibit the growth of five different fungal pathogens and rootworm larvae (<i>Diabrotica balteata</i>). In vivo disease resistance assays, using <i>ZmTps21</i> and <i>Zmtps21</i> near-isogenic lines, further support the endogenous antifungal role of selinene-derived metabolites.

Dynamic Cytology and Transcriptional Regulation of Rice Lamina Joint Development
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) leaf angle is determined by lamina joint and is an important agricultural trait determining leaf erectness and, hence, the photosynthesis efficiency and grain yield. Genetic studies reveal a complex regulatory network of lamina joint development; however, the morphological changes, cytological transitions, and underlying transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ming remain to be elucidated. A systemic morphological and cytological study reveals a dynamic developmental process and suggests a common but distinct regulation of the lamina joint. Successive and sequential cell division and expansion, cell wall thickening, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death at the adaxial or abaxial sides form the cytological basis of the lamina joint, and the increased leaf angle results from the asymmetric cell proliferation and elongation. Analysis of the gene expression profiles at four distinct developmental stages ranging from initiation to senescence showed that genes related to cell division and growth, hormone synthesis and signaling, transcription (transcription factors), and protein phosphorylation (protein kinases) exhibit distinct spatiotemporal patterns during lamina joint development. Phytohormones play crucial roles by promoting cell differentiation and growth at early stages or regulating the maturation and senescence at later stages, which is consistent with the quantitative analysis of hormones at different stages. Further comparison with the gene expression profile of <i>leaf inclination1</i>, a mutant with decreased auxin and increased leaf angle, indicates the coordinated effects of hormones in regulating lamina joint. These results reveal a dynamic cytology of rice lamina joint that is fine-regulated by multiple factors, providing informative clues for illustrating the regulatory mechanisms of leaf angle and plant architecture.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete fertility of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ed cell death , producing fertile gametes.

MAP Kinase PrMPK9-1 Contributes to the Self-Incompatibility Response
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) form important signaling modules for a variety of cellular responses in eukaryotic cells. In plants, MAPKs play key roles in growth and development as well as in immunity/stress responses. Pollen-pistil interactions are critical early events regulating pollination and fertilization and involve many signaling events. Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism to prevent self-fertilization and inbreeding in higher plants and also is known to utilize signaling to achieve incompatible pollen rejection. Although several pollen-expressed MAPKs exist, very little is known about their function. We previously identified a pollen-expressed MAPK (p56) from <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> that was rapidly activated during SI; several studies implicated its role in signaling to SI-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death involving a DEVDase. However, to date, the identity of the MAPK involved has been unknown. Here, we have identified and cloned a pollen-expressed <i>P. rhoeas</i> threonine-aspartate-tyrosine (TDY) MAPK, <i>PrMPK9-1</i>. Rather few data relating to the function of TDY MAPKs in plants currently exist. We provide evidence that <i>PrMPK9-1</i> has a cell type-specific function, with a distinct role from <i>AtMPK9</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first study implicating a function for a TDY MAPK in pollen. We show that PrMPK9-1 corresponds to p56 and demonstrate that it is functionally involved in mediating SI in <i>P. rhoeas</i> pollen: PrMPK9-1 is a key regulator for SI in pollen and acts upstream of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death involving actin and activation of a DEVDase. Our study provides an important advance in elucidating functional roles for this class of MAPKs.</p>

Understanding and Manipulating Meiotic Recombination in Plants
<p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of chromosomes, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is homologous recombination, which promotes homologous pairing and generates crossovers (COs) to connect homologous chromosomes until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on chromosomes. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per chromosome pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of chromosome size. Moreover, their positions are not random on chromosomes but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the generation of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.</p>

A Subset of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes Is Essential for Plant Immunity
<p>Of the three classes of enzymes involved in ubiquitination, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) have been often incorrectly considered to play merely an auxiliary role in the process, and few E2 enzymes have been investigated in plants. To reveal the role of E2 in plant innate immunity, we identified and cloned 40 tomato genes encoding ubiquitin E2 proteins. Thioester assays indicated that the majority of the genes encode enzymatically active E2. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 40 tomato E2 enzymes into 13 groups, of which members of group III were found to interact and act specifically with AvrPtoB, a <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> effector that uses its ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity to suppress host immunity. Knocking down the expression of group III E2 genes in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> diminished the AvrPtoB-promoted degradation of the Fen kinase and the AvrPtoB suppression of host immunity-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death. Importantly, silencing group III E2 genes also resulted in reduced pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). By contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death induced by several effector-triggered immunity elicitors was not affected on group III-silenced plants. Functional characterization suggested redundancy among group III members for their role in the suppression of plant immunity by AvrPtoB and in PTI and identified UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING11 (UBC11), UBC28, UBC29, UBC39, and UBC40 as playing a more significant role in PTI than other group III members. Our work builds a foundation for the further characterization of E2s in plant immunity and reveals that AvrPtoB has evolved a strategy for suppressing host immunity that is difficult for the plant to thwart.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

The Transcription Factor ATHB5 Affects GA-Mediated Plasticity in Hypocotyl Cell Growth during Seed Germination
<p>Gibberellic acid (GA)-mediated cell expansion initiates the seed-to-seedling transition in plants and is repressed by DELLA proteins. Using digital single-cell analysis, we identified a cellular subdomain within the midhypocotyl, whose expansion drives the final step of this developmental transition under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al conditions. Using network inference, the transcription factor ATHB5 was identified as a genetic factor whose localized expression promotes GA-mediated expansion specifically within these cells. Both this protein and its putative growth-promoting target <i>EXPANSIN3</i> are repressed by DELLA, and coregulated at single-cell resolution during seed germination. The cellular domains of hormone sensitivity were explored within the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) embryo by putting seeds under GA-limiting conditions and quantifying cellular growth responses. The middle and upper hypocotyl have a greater requirement for GA to promote cell expansion than the lower embryo axis. Under these conditions, germination was still completed following enhanced growth within the radicle and lower axis. Under GA-limiting conditions, the <i>athb5</i> mutant did not show a phenotype at the level of seed germination, but it did at a cellular level with reduced cell expansion in the hypocotyl relative to the wild type. These data reveal that the spatiotemporal cell expansion events driving this transition are not determinate, and the conditional use of GA-ATHB5-mediated hypocotyl growth under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al conditions may be used to optionally support rapid seedling growth. This study demonstrates that multiple genetic and spatiotemporal cell expansion mechanisms underlie the seed to seedling transition in Arabidopsis.</p>

Phytoglobins Improve Hypoxic Root Growth by Alleviating Apical Meristem Cell Death
<p>Hypoxic root growth in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is influenced by the expression of phytoglobins (<i>ZmPgbs</i>). Relative to the wild type, suppression of <i>ZmPgb1.1</i> or <i>ZmPgb1.2</i> inhibits the growth of roots exposed to 4% oxygen, causing structural abnormalities in the root apical meristems. These effects were accompanied by increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), possibly through the transcriptional induction of four <i>Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs</i>. TUNEL-positive nuclei in meristematic cells indicated the involvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death (PCD) in the process. These cells also accumulated nitric oxide and stained heavily for ethylene biosynthetic transcripts. A sharp increase in the expression level of several 1-aminocyclopropane synthase (<i>ZmAcs2</i>, <i>ZmAcs6</i>, and <i>ZmAcs7</i>), 1-aminocyclopropane oxidase (<i>Aco15</i>, <i>Aco20</i>, <i>Aco31</i>, and <i>Aco35</i>), and ethylene-responsive (<i>ZmErf2</i> and <i>ZmEbf1</i>) genes was observed in hypoxic <i>ZmPgb</i>-suppressing roots, which overproduced ethylene. Inhibiting ROS synthesis with diphenyleneiodonium or ethylene perception with 1-methylcyclopropene suppressed PCD, increased <i>BAX inhibitor-1</i>, an effective attenuator of the death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s in eukaryotes, and restored root growth. Hypoxic roots overexpressing <i>ZmPgbs</i> had the lowest level of ethylene and showed a reduction in ROS staining and TUNEL-positive nuclei in the meristematic cells. These roots retained functional meristems and exhibited the highest growth performance when subjected to hypoxic conditions. Collectively, these results suggest a novel function of Pgbs in protecting root apical meristems from hypoxia-induced PCD through mechanisms initiated by nitric oxide and mediated by ethylene via ROS.</p>

Heterochronic Meiotic Misexpression in an Interspecific Yeast Hybrid
<p>Regulatory changes rapidly accumulate between species, and interspecific hybrids often misexpress genes. Hybrid misexpression, expression levels outside the range of both parental species, can result from <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-acting regulatory changes that interact abnormally in hybrids. Thus, misexpressed genes may contribute to hybrid sterility. However, in the context of a whole organism, misexpression may not result directly from <i>cis–trans</i> interactions but rather indirectly from differences between hybrid and parental abundance of cell types. Here we eliminate the confounding effects of cell types by examining gene expression in a sterile interspecific yeast hybrid during meiosis. We investigated gene expression of the yeasts <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>S. paradoxus</i>, and their hybrid at multiple meiotic stages. Although the hybrid and parents exhibit similar changes in expression levels across meiosis, the hybrid meiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> occurs earlier than either parent. The timing change produces a heterochronic pattern of misexpression during midmeiosis. Coincident with the timing of misexpression, we find a transition from predominantly <i>trans</i>-acting to <i>cis-</i>acting expression divergence and an increase in the number of opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes. However, we find no direct relationship between opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes and misexpression. Contrary to the notion that <i>cis–trans</i> interactions cause misexpression, a heterochronic shift in the normal meiotic gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> produces patterns of misexpression in an yeast hybrid. Our results imply that temporal dynamics of single cell types is important to understanding hybrid misexpression and its relationship to <i>cis–trans</i> interactions.</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from <ext-link>www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an inbred line of <i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>, an allotetraploid crop with great environmental adaptability and outstanding nutritional properties
<p><i>Chenopodium quinoa</i> Willd. (quinoa) originated from the Andean region of South America, and is a pseudocereal crop of the Amaranthaceae family. Quinoa is emerging as an important crop with the potential to contribute to food security worldwide and is considered to be an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al food source for astronauts, due to its outstanding nutritional profile and ability to tolerate stressful environments. Furthermore, plant pathologists use quinoa as a representative diagnostic host to identify virus species. However, molecular analysis of quinoa is limited by its genetic heterogeneity due to outcrossing and its genome complexity derived from allotetraploidy. To overcome these obstacles, we established the inbred and standard quinoa accession Kd that enables rigorous molecular analysis, and presented the draft genome sequence of Kd, using an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ized combination of high-throughput next generation sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 and PacBio RS II sequencers. The <i>de novo</i> genome assembly contained 25 k scaffolds consisting of 1 Gbp with N50 length of 86 kbp. Based on these data, we constructed the free-access Quinoa Genome DataBase (QGDB). Thus, these findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying agronomically important traits of quinoa and the effect of allotetraploidy on genome evolution.</p>

Evaluation of Codon Biology in <i>Citrus</i> and <i>Poncirus trifoliata</i> Based on Genomic Features and Frame Corrected Expressed Sequence Tags
<p><i>Citrus</i>, as one of the globally important fruit trees, has been an object of interest for understanding genetics and evolutionary process in fruit crops. Meta-analyses of 19 <i>Citrus</i> species, including 4 globally and economically important <i>Citrus sinensis</i>, <i>Citrus clementina</i>, <i>Citrus reticulata</i>, and 1 <i>Citrus</i> relative <i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>, were performed. We observed that codons ending with A- or T- at the wobble position were preferred in contrast to C- or G- ending codons, indicating a close association with AT richness of <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. The present study postulates a large repertoire of a set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al codons for the <i>Citrus</i> genus and <i>P. trifoliata</i> and demonstrates that GCT and GGT are evolutionary conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al codons. Our observation suggested that mutational bias is the dominating force in shaping the codon usage bias (CUB) in <i>Citrus</i> and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. Correspondence analysis (COA) revealed that the principal axis [axis 1; COA/relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)] contributes only a minor portion (∼10.96%) of the recorded variance. In all analysed species, except <i>P. trifoliata</i>, Gravy and aromaticity played minor roles in resolving CUB. Compositional constraints were found to be strongly associated with the amino acid signatures in <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. Our present analysis postulates compositional constraints in <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i> and plausible role of the stress with GC<sub>3</sub> and coevolution pattern of amino acid.</p>

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based risk factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates adult lipid measures. We assessed and compared the utility of a risk model based solely on nonlaboratory risk factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory risk factors plus lipids for predicting high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study) and followed into adulthood when cIMT was measured (mean follow-up, 23.4 years). Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-risk plasma lipid levels were defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Cholesterol Levels in Children. High cIMT was defined as a study-specific value ≥90th percentile. Age and sex were included in each model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In univariate models, all risk factors except for borderline high and high triglycerides in adolescence were associated with high cIMT in adulthood. In multivariable models (relative risk [95% confidence interval]), male sex (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) remained significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05). The addition of lipids into the nonlaboratory risk model slightly but significantly improved discrimination in predicting high cIMT compared with nonlaboratory-based risk factors only (C statistics for laboratory-based model 0.717 [95% confidence interval, 0.685–0.748] and for nonlaboratory 0.698 [95% confidence interval, 0.667–0.731]; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Nonlaboratory-based risk factors and lipids measured in adolescence independently predicted preclinical atherosclerosis in young adulthood. The addition of lipid measurements to traditional clinic-based risk factor assessment provided a statistically significant but clinically modest improvement on adolescent prediction of high cIMT in adulthood.</p></sec>

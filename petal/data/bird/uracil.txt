Fat controls U
<p>Uridine (U) is a remarkably important molecule that is essential for a number of evolutionary and biological processes. It consists of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyrimidin</span></strong>e-analog uracil, which is linked to a ribose sugar. Uracil itself can be formed abiotically from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyrimidin</span></strong>e, suggesting that this base is a central building block of life. Uridine, by contrast, is a precursor for RNA, thus linking genetic information to the expression of proteins. Importantly, when phosphorylated to uridine triphosphate (UTP), it activates glucose to synthesize glycogen stores and thereby controls glucose metabolism. Uridine also has been implicated in neuron functions and brain processes. On page 1173 of this issue, Deng <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) offer transformative insights into the systemic regulation of circulating uridine and its actions in mammals, with implications for the potential of therapeutic uridine supplementation in general and new precision treatments of metabolic diseases in particular.</p>

Bifurcating electron-transfer pathways in DNA photolyases determine the repair quantum yield
<p>Photolyase is a blue-light–activated enzyme that repairs ultraviolet-induced DNA damage that occurs in the form of cyclobutane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyrimidin</span></strong>e dimers (CPDs) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyrimidin</span></strong>e-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts. Previous studies on microbial photolyases have revealed an electron-tunneling pathway that is critical for the repair mechanism. In this study, we used femtosecond spectroscopy to deconvolute seven electron-transfer reactions in 10 elementary steps in all classes of CPD photolyases. We report a unified electron-transfer pathway through a conserved structural configuration that bifurcates to favor direct tunneling in prokaryotes and a two-step hopping mechanism in eukaryotes. Both bifurcation routes are operative, but their relative contributions, dictated by the reduction potentials of the flavin cofactor and the substrate, determine the overall quantum yield of repair.</p>

The zebrafish orthologue of the human hepatocerebral disease gene <i>MPV17</i> plays pleiotropic roles in mitochondria
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The zebrafish <i>mpv17</i><sup>−/−</sup> mutant shows a severe mitochondrial phenotype with ultrastructural alterations and oxidative phosphorylation impairment. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyrimidin</span></strong>e precursor orotic acid ameliorates <i>mpv17</i><sup>−/−</sup> phenotype and increases mitochondrial DNA content, linking the loss of Mpv17 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyrimidin</span></strong>e <i>de novo</i> synthesis.</p>

The intracellular pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase NT5C3A is a negative epigenetic factor in interferon and cytokine signaling
<p>The enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyrimidin</span></strong>e 5′-nucleotidase (NT5C3A), which mediates nucleotide catabolism, was previously thought to be restricted to blood cells. We showed that expression of the gene encoding NT5C3A was induced by type I interferons (IFNs) in multiple cell types and that NT5C3A suppressed cytokine production through inhibition of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. <i>NT5C3A</i> expression required both an intronic IFN-stimulated response element and the IFN-stimulated transcription factor IRF1. Overexpression of NT5C3A, but not of its catalytic mutants, suppressed IL-8 production by HEK293 cells. Whereas knockdown of <i>NT5C3A</i> enhanced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–stimulated IL-8 production, it reduced the IFN-mediated suppression of <i>Il8</i> expression. Overexpression of <i>NT5C3A</i> increased the abundance of NAD<sup>+</sup> and the activation of the sirtuins SIRT1 and SIRT6, which are NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylases. NT5C3A-stimulated sirtuin activity resulted in deacetylation of histone H3 and the NF-κB subunit RelA (also known as p65), both of which were associated with the proximal region of the <i>Il8</i> promoter, thus repressing the transcription of <i>Il8</i>. Together, these data identify an anti-inflammatory pathway that depends on the catalytic activity of NT5C3A and functions as a negative feedback regulator of inflammatory cytokine signaling.</p>

An adipo-biliary-uridine axis that regulates energy homeostasis
<p>Uridine, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyrimidin</span></strong>e nucleoside present at high levels in the plasma of rodents and humans, is critical for RNA synthesis, glycogen deposition, and many other essential cellular processes. It also contributes to systemic metabolism, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We found that plasma uridine levels are regulated by fasting and refeeding in mice, rats, and humans. Fasting increases plasma uridine levels, and this increase relies largely on adipocytes. In contrast, refeeding reduces plasma uridine levels through biliary clearance. Elevation of plasma uridine is required for the drop in body temperature that occurs during fasting. Further, feeding-induced clearance of plasma uridine improves glucose metabolism. We also present findings that implicate leptin signaling in uridine homeostasis and consequent metabolic control and thermoregulation. Our results indicate that plasma uridine governs energy homeostasis and thermoregulation in a mechanism involving adipocyte-dependent uridine biosynthesis and leptin signaling.</p>

Prospective randomised trial of non-operative <i>versus</i> operative management of olecranon fractures in the elderly
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this prospective randomised controlled trial was to   compare non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative management for acute isolated   displaced fractures of the olecranon in patients aged ≥ 75 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to either non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative management or   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative management with either tension-band wiring or fixation   with a plate. They were reviewed at six weeks, three and six months   and one year after the injury. The primary outcome measure was the   Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score at one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 19 patients were randomised to non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative (n =   8) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative (n = 11; tension-band wiring (n = 9), plate (n =   2)) management. The trial was stopped prematurely as the rate of   complications (nine out of 11, 81.8%) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative group was   considered to be unacceptable. There was, however, no difference   in the mean DASH scores between the groups at all times. The mean   score was 23 (0 to 59.6) in the non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative group and 22 (2.5   to 57.8) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative group, one year after the injury (p =   0.763). There was no significant difference between groups in the   secondary outcome measures of the Broberg and Morrey Score or the   Mayo Elbow Score at any time during the one year following injury   (all    p ≥ 0.05). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data further support the role of primary non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   management of isolated displaced fractures of the olecranon in the   elderly.

How Do Resuscitation Teams at Top-Performing Hospitals for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Succeed?
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is common, and outcomes vary substantially across US hospitals, but reasons for these differences are largely unknown. We set out to better understand how top-performing hospitals organize their resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s to achieve high survival rates for IHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We calculated risk-standardized IHCA survival to discharge rates across American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation registry hospitals between 2012 and 2014. We identified geographically and academically diverse hospitals in the top, middle, and bottom quartiles of survival for IHCA and performed a qualitative study that included site visits with in-depth interviews of clinical and administrative staff at 9 hospitals. With the use of thematic analysis, data were analyzed to identify salient themes of perceived performance by informants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Across 9 hospitals, we interviewed 158 individuals from multiple disciplines including physicians (17.1%), nurses (45.6%), other clinical staff (17.1%), and administration (20.3%). We identified 4 broad themes related to resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s: (1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> design, (2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> composition and roles, (3) communication and leadership during IHCA, and (4) training and education. Resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s at top-performing hospitals demonstrated the following features: dedicated or designated resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s; participation of diverse disciplines as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> members during IHCA; clear roles and responsibilities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> members; better communication and leadership during IHCA; and in-depth mock codes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s at hospitals with high IHCA survival differ from non–top-performing hospitals. Our findings suggest core elements of successful resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s that are associated with better outcomes and form the basis for future work to improve IHCA.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the impact of   intravenous tranexamic acid on the reduction of blood loss, transfusion   rate, and early post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative clinical outcome in total shoulder   arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A randomised, placebo-controlled trial which included 54 patients   undergoing unilateral primary stemless anatomical or stemmed reverse   total shoulder arthroplasty was undertaken. Patients received either   100 ml saline (placebo, n = 27), or 100 ml saline together with   1000 mg of tranexamic acid (TXA, n = 27) intravenously prior to   skin incision and during wound closure. Peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative blood loss   via an intra-articular drain was recorded and total blood loss was   calculated. The post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative transfusion rate was documented.   Assessment of early clinical parameters included the visual analogue   scale for pain (VAS), documentation of haematoma formation and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative blood drainage (placebo: 170 ml <i>versus</i> TXA:   50 ml, p = 0.001) and calculated mean total blood loss (placebo:   1248.2 ml <i>versus</i> TXA: 871.0 ml, p = 0.009) were   significantly lower in the TXA group. No transfusions were necessary   during the study period in either group. Mean VAS for pain significantly   decreased from pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative (VAS 7) to the early post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   period (VAS 1.7, p < 0.001). Significant differences regarding   mean post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative pain between placebo (VAS 2.0) and TXA (VAS   1.3) were detected (p = 0.05). The occurrence of haematomas was   significantly more frequent in the placebo (59.3%, n = 16) than   in the TXA group (25.9%, n = 6, p = 0.027). Whereas only mild haematomas   developed in the TXA group, in the placebo group a total of 22.2%   (n = 6) developed either moderate or severe haematomas.

Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation. The novel method of LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical cut points. For low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we evaluated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation performs better in nonfasting samples than the fixed Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides.

Radiation-Induced DNA Damage in Operators Performing Endovascular Aortic Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Radiation exposure during fluoroscopically guided interventions such as endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is a growing concern for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators. This study aimed to measure DNA damage/repair markers in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators perfoming EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Expression of the DNA damage/repair marker, γ-H2AX and DNA damage response marker, phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM), were quantified in circulating lymphocytes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators during the peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative period of endovascular (infrarenal, branched, and fenestrated) and open aortic repair using flow cytometry. These markers were separately measured in the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators but this time wearing leg lead shielding in addition to upper body protection and compared with those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating with unprotected legs. Susceptibility to radiation damage was determined by irradiating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators’ blood in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>γ-H2AX and pATM levels increased significantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators immediately after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.0003 for both). Only pATM levels increased after infrarenal endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.04). Expression of both markers fell to baseline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators after 24 hours (<i>P</i><0.003 for both). There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM expression after open repair. Leg protection abrogated γ-H2AX and pATM response after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair. The expression of γ-H2AX varied significantly when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators’ blood was exposed to the same radiation dose in vitro (<i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This is the first study to detect an acute DNA damage response in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators performing fluoroscopically guided aortic procedures and highlights the protective effect of leg shielding.

Mode of action of a <i>Drosophila</i> FMRFamide in inducing muscle contraction
<p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a model system for examining the mechanisms of action of neuropeptides. DPKQDFMRFamide was previously shown to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscle fibres in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The present study examined the possible involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor and second messengers in mediating this myotropic effect after removal of the central nervous system. DPKQDFMRFamide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were reduced by 70% and 90%, respectively, in larvae with reduced expression of the <i>Drosophila Fmrf</i> receptor (FR) either ubiquitously or specifically in muscle tissue, compared with the response in control larvae in which expression was not manipulated. No such effect occurred in larvae with reduced expression of this gene only in neurons. The myogenic effects of DPKQDFMRFamide do not appear to be mediated through either of the two <i>Drosophila</i> myosuppressin receptors (<i>DmsR-1</i> and <i>DmsR-2</i>). DPKQDFMRFamide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were not reduced in Ala1 transgenic flies lacking activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamKII), and were not affected by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. Peptide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions in the mutants of the phospholipase C-β (<i>PLC</i>β) gene (<i>norpA</i> larvae) and in IP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants were similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions elicited in control larvae. The peptide failed to increase cAMP and cGMP levels in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscles. Peptide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were not potentiated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and were not antagonized by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent or cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Additionally, exogenous application of arachidonic acid failed to induce myogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions. Thus, DPKQDFMRFamide induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions via a G-protein coupled FMRFamide receptor in muscle cells but does not appear to act via cAMP, cGMP, IP<sub>3</sub>, PLC, CaMKII or arachidonic acid.</p>

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-thickness cartilage loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-thickness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness   cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients   with partial thickness loss achieve a good result we cannot currently   identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful   and misleading.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:475–82.</p></sec>

Revision total knee arthroplasty for failed high tibial osteotomy and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have similar patient-reported outcome measures in a two-year follow-up study
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about the relative outcomes of revision of unicompartmental   knee arthroplasty (UKA) and high tibial osteotomy (HTO) to total   knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study is to compare the   outcomes of revision surgery for the two procedures in terms of   complications, re-revision and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)   at a minimum of two years follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This study was a retrospective review of data from an institutional   arthroplasty registry for cases performed between 2001 and 2014.   A total of 292 patients were identified, of which 217 had a revision   of HTO to TKA, and 75 had revision of UKA to TKA. While mean follow-up   was longer for the HTO group compared with the UKA group, patient   demographics (age, body mass index and Charlson co-morbidity index)   and PROMs (Short Form-36, Oxford Knee Score, Knee Society Score,   both objective and functional) were similar in the two groups prior   to revision surgery.

Association of Pediatric Medical Emergency Teams With Hospital Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Implementation of medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s has been identified as a potential strategy to reduce hospital deaths, because these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s respond to patients with acute physiological decline in an effort to prevent in-hospital cardiac arrest.

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine samples on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine sample between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection during a 17-year follow-up. Sodium intake was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated with a single baseline collection and the average of samples collected during a 1-, 5-, and 15-year follow-up. We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine samples. Average age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. Average 24-hour sodium excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88).

Outcome of the Swedish Nationwide Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Program
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A general abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>, targeting 65-year-old men, has gradually been introduced in Sweden since 2006 and reached nationwide coverage in 2015. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data on the number of invited and examined men, screening-detected AAAs, AAAs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ated on, and surgical outcome were retrieved from all 21 Swedish counties for the years 2006 through 2014. AAA-specific mortality data were retrieved from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. A linear regression analysis was used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate the effect on AAA-specific mortality among all men ≥65 years of age for the observed time period. The long-term effects were projected by using a validated Markov model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 302 957 men aged 65 years invited, 84% attended. The prevalence of screening-detected AAA was 1.5%. After a mean of 4.5 years, 29% of patients with AAA had been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ated on, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9% (1.3% after open repair and 0.3% after endovascular repair, <i>P</i><0.001). The introduction of screening was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-specific mortality (mean, 4.0% per year of screening, <i>P</i>=0.020). The number needed to screen and the number needed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ate on to prevent 1 premature death were 667 and 1.5, respectively. With a total population of 9.5 million, the Swedish national AAA-screening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> was predicted to annually prevent 90 premature deaths from AAA and to gain 577 quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-efficiency ratio was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated to be €7770 per quality-adjusted life-years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Screening 65-year-old men for AAA is an effective preventive health measure and is highly cost-effective in a contemporary setting. These findings confirm the results from earlier randomized controlled trials and model studies in a large population-based setting of the importance for future healthcare decision making.</p></sec>

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s ability   to bear weight, but historically, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative fixation has been associated   with a high rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. In this study, we describe the outcomes   of fixation using modern implants within a strategy of early return   to function.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients treated at our centre with lateral distal femoral   locking plates (LDFLP) between 2009 and 2014 were identified.

Equalisation of leg lengths in total hip arthroplasty for patients with Crowe type-IV developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>There is no consensus about the best method of achieving equal   leg lengths at total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with Crowe   type-IV developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). We reviewed our   experience of a consecutive series of patients who underwent THA   for this indication.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed 78 patients (86 THAs) with Crowe   type-IV DDH, including 64 women and 14 men, with a minimum follow-up   of two years. The mean age at the time of surgery was 52.2 years   (34 to 82). We subdivided Crowe type-IV DDH into two major types   according to the number of dislocated hips, and further categorised   them into three groups according to the occurrence of pelvic obliquity   or spinal curvature.

Contemporary failure aetiologies of the primary, posterior-stabilised total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of revision total knee arthroplasties (TKA) that are   performed is expected to increase. However, previous reports of   the causes of failure after TKA are limited in that they report   the causes at specific institutions, which are often dependent on   referral patterns. Our aim was to report the most common indications   for re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations and revisions in a large series of posterior-stabilised   TKAs undertaken at a single institution, excluding referrals from   elsewhere, which may bias the causes of failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 5098 TKAs which were undertaken between 2000 and 2012   were included in the study. Re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations, revisions with modular   component exchange, and revisions with non-modular component replacement   or removal were identified from the medical records. The mean follow-up   was five years (two to 12).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Kaplan-Meier ten-year survival without a re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation, modular   component revision and non-modular component revision was 95.7%,   99.3% and 95.3%, respectively. The most common indications for a   re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation were: post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative stiffness (58%), delayed wound healing   (21%), and patellar clunk (11%). The indications for isolated modular   component revision were acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   (64%) and instability (36%). The most common indications for non-modular   component revision were chronic PJI (52%), aseptic loosening (17%), periprosthetic   fracture (10%), and instability (10%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative stiffness remains the most common indication for   re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation after TKA. Infection is the most common indication   for modular and non-modular component revision. Aseptic loosening   was not an uncommon cause of failure, however, it was much less   common than in national registry and non-registry data.

Minimally invasive surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to report a retrospective, consecutive   series of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who   were treated with posterior minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with   a mean follow-up of two years (<sc>sd</sc> 1.4; 0.9 to 0 3.7). Our   objectives were to measure the correction of the deformity and record   the peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative morbidity. Special attention was paid to the   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time (ORT), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated blood loss (EBL), length of stay   (LOS) and further complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively collected the data of 70 consecutive patients   with AIS treated with MIS using three incisions and a muscle-splitting   approach by a single surgeon between June 2013 and February 2016   and these were retrospectively reviewed.

Intra-operative digital imaging
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to examine the rate at which the   positioning of the acetabular component, leg length discrepancy   and femoral offset are outside an acceptable range in total hip   arthroplasties (THAs) which either do or do not involve the use   of intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative digital imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective case-control study was undertaken with 50 patients   before and 50 patients after the integration of an intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   digital imaging system in THA.

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

Effect of pre-operative expectations on the outcomes following total shoulder arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>Few studies have evaluated the relationship between patients’   pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative expectations and the outcome of orthopaedic procedures.   Our aim was to determine the effect of expectations on the outcome   after primary anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA).

Activity levels and return to work following total knee arthroplasty in patients under 65 years of age
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about employment following total knee arthroplasty   (TKA). This study aims to identify factors which predict return   to work following TKA in patients of working age in the United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients & Methods</title><p>We prospectively assessed 289 patients (289 TKAs) aged ≤ 65 years   who underwent TKA between 2010 and 2013. There were 148 women. The   following were recorded pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively: age, gender, body mass   index, social deprivation, comorbidities, indication for surgery,   work status and nature of employment, activity level as assessed by   the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score   and Oxford Knee Score (OKS). The intention of patients to return   to work or to retire was not assessed pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.

Predicting dissatisfaction following total knee arthroplasty in patients under 55 years of age
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Risk of revision following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is higher   in patients under 55 years, but little data are reported regarding   non-revision outcomes. This study aims to identify predictors of   dissatisfaction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively assessed 177 TKAs (157 consecutive patients,   99 women, mean age 50 years; 17 to 54) from 2008 to 2013. Age, gender,   implant, indication, body mass index (BMI), social deprivation,   range of movement, Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of osteoarthritis   (OA) and prior knee surgery were recorded. Pre- and post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   Oxford Knee Score (OKS) as well as Short Form-12 physical (PCS)   and mental component scores were obtained.

Trends and risk factors for prolonged opioid use after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate trends in opioid use   after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), to identify predictors   of prolonged use and to compare the rates of opioid use after UKA,   total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We identified 4205 patients who had undergone UKA between 2007   and 2015 from the Humana Inc. administrative claims database. Post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   opioid use for one year post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively was assessed using the   rates of monthly repeat prescription. These were then compared between   patients with and without a specific variable of interest and with   those of patients who had undergone TKA and THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 4205 UKA patients were analysed. Of these, 1362 patients   (32.4%) were users of opioids. Pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative opioid use was the   strongest predictor of prolonged opioid use after UKA. Opioid users   were 1.4 (81.6% <i>versus</i> 57.7%), 3.7 (49.5% <i>versus</i> 13.3%)   and 5.5    (35.8% <i>versus</i> 6.5%) times more likely to be taking   opioids at one, two and three months post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, respectively   (p < 0.05 for all). Younger age and specific comorbidities such   as anxiety/depression, smoking, back pain and substance abuse were   found to significantly increase the rate of repeat prescription   for opioids after UKA.

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the risk of bleeding. Although empirical models have been developed to predict such risks, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011. Empirical stroke and bleeding risks were assessed by using the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS<sub>2</sub>) and Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) scores, respectively. Separately, physicians were asked to categorize their patients’ stroke and bleeding risks: low risk (<3%); intermediate risk (3%–6%); and high risk (>6%). Overall, 72% (n=7251) in ORBIT-AF had high-risk CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores (≥2). However, only 16% were assessed as high stroke risk by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding risk (score ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians. The associations between empirical and physician-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated stroke and bleeding risks were low (weighted Kappa 0.1 and 0.11, respectively). Physicians weighed hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus less significantly than empirical models in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating stroke risk; physicians weighted anemia and dialysis less significantly than empirical models when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating bleeding risks. Anticoagulation use was highest among patients with high stroke risk, assessed by either empirical model or physician <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates. In contrast, physician and empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of bleeding had limited impact on treatment choice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>There is little agreement between provider-assessed risk and empirical scores in AF.

Cash for carbon: A randomized trial of payments for ecosystem services to reduce deforestation
<p>We evaluated a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> of payments for ecosystem services in Uganda that offered forest-owning households annual payments of 70,000 Ugandan shillings per hectare if they conserved their forest. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> was implemented as a randomized controlled trial in 121 villages, 60 of which received the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in land area covered by trees, measured by classifying high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that tree cover declined by 4.2% during the study period in treatment villages, compared to 9.1% in control villages. We found no evidence that enrollees shifted their deforestation to nearby land. We valued the delayed carbon dioxide e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mission</span></strong>s and found that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> benefit is 2.4 times as large as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> costs.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of the Arabidopsis Replication Timing Program
<p>Eukaryotes use a temporally regulated process, known as the replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>, to ensure that their genomes are fully and accurately duplicated during S phase. Replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s are predictive of genomic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of chromatin organization. Although replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to genome sequence and chromatin structure. We used the thymidine analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the genome-wide replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified genomic regions that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and correlated these regions with genomic features and with data for chromatin state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis chromosome arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric regions replicate late. Early and mid-replicating regions are gene-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late regions are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of chromatin states across the different times is complex, with each replication time corresponding to a mixture of states. Early and mid-replicating sequences interact with each other and not with late sequences, but early regions are more accessible than mid regions. The replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite genomic organization with early/mid-replicating regions and late regions forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated largely by chromatin accessibility.</p>

SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE1 Links DNA Damage Response to Organ Regeneration
<p>In Arabidopsis, DNA damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death is limited to the meristematic stem cell niche and its early descendants. The significance of this cell-type-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death is unclear. Here, we demonstrate in roots that it is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med destruction of the mitotically compromised stem cell niche that triggers its regeneration, enabling growth recovery. In contrast to wild-type plants, <i>sog1</i> plants, which are defective in damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death, maintain the cell identities and stereotypical structure of the stem cell niche after irradiation, but these cells fail to undergo cell division, terminating root growth. We propose DNA damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death is employed by plants as a developmental response, contrasting with its role as an anticarcinogenic response in animals. This role in plants may have evolved to restore the growth of embryos after the accumulation of DNA damage in seeds.</p>

Mid-term outcomes of 77 modular radial head prostheses
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Radial head arthroplasty (RHA) may be used in the treatment of   non-reconstructable radial head fractures. The aim of this study   was to evaluate the mid-term clinical and radiographic results of   RHA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 77 RHAs were implanted in 54 men and 23   women with either acute injuries (54) or with traumatic sequelae   (23) of a fracture of the radial head. Four designs of RHA were   used, including the Guepar (Small Bone Innovations (SBi)/Stryker;   36), Evolutive (Aston Medical; 24), rHead RECON (SBi/Stryker; ten)   or rHead STANDARD (SBi/Stryker; 7) prostheses. The mean follow-up   was 74.0 months (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 38.6; 24 to 141).   The indication for further surgery, range of movement, mean Mayo   Elbow Performance (MEP) score, quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (quickDASH) score, osteolysis and positioning of the implant   were also assessed according to the design, and acute or delayed   use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean MEP and quickDASH scores were 90.2 (<sc>sd</sc> 14;   45 to 100), and 14.0 points (<sc>sd</sc> 12; 1.2 to 52.5), respectively. There   were no significant differences between RHA performed in acute or   delayed fashion. There were 30 re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations (19 with, and 11 without   removal of the implant) during the first three post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative years.

Short-stemmed prostheses (16 mm to 22 mm in length) were also associated   with an increased risk of painful loosening (odds ratio 3.54 (1.02   to 12.2), p = 0.045). Radiocapitellar instability was the primary   indication for re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation with retention of the implant (5).

A pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing the efficacy of a femoral nerve block and periarticular infiltration for early pain relief following total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a femoral   nerve block and a periarticular infiltration in the management of   early post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A pragmatic, single centre, two arm parallel group, patient blinded,   randomised controlled trial was undertaken. All patients due for   TKA were eligible. Exclusion criteria included contraindications   to the medications involved in the study and patients with a neurological   abnormality of the lower limb. Patients received either a femoral   nerve block with 75 mg of 0.25% levobupivacaine hydrochloride around   the nerve, or periarticular infiltration with 150 mg of 0.25% levobupivacaine   hydrochloride, 10 mg morphine sulphate, 30 mg ketorolac trometamol   and 0.25 mg of adrenaline all diluted with 0.9% saline to make a   volume of 150 ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 264 patients were recruited and data from 230 (88%)   were available for the primary analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis   of the primary outcome measure of a visual analogue score for pain   on the first post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative day, prior to physiotherapy, was similar   in both groups.

Long-term outcomes of cemented <i>versus</i> cementless humeral components in arthroplasty of the shoulder
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In the initial development of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA),   the humeral component was usually fixed with cement. Cementless   components were subsequently introduced. The aim of this study was   to compare the long-term outcome of cemented and cementless humeral   components in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 cemented humeral components and   3469 cementless components. Patients with the two types of fixation   were matched for nine different covariates using a propensity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with cemented   and cementless components were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral component determined at revision surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative infection and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of survival were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively. Survival without loosening   at 20 years was 98% for cemented components and 92.4% for cementless   components. After propensity score matching including fixation as   determined by the design of the component, humeral loosening was   also found to be significantly higher in the cementless group. Survival   without humeral loosening at 20 years was 98.7% for cemented components   and 91.0% for cementless components. There was no significant difference   in the risk of intra- or post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative fracture. The rate of survival   without deep infection and the mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time were significantly   higher in the cemented group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both types of fixation give rates of long-term survival of >   90%. Cemented components have better rates of survival without loosening   but this should be weighed against increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time and   the risk of bony destruction of the proximal humerus at the time   of revision of a cemented humeral component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:666–73.</p></sec>

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, it was found that 64 components were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was a score of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring system and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular component.   This scoring system provides a clinically useful tool for pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   planning, and the evaluation of the outcome of revision surgery   for patients with loosening of a cementless acetabular component   in the presence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:601–6.</p></sec>

A systematic review of Vancouver B2 and B3 periprosthetic femoral fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of Vancouver   type B2 and B3 fractures by performing a systematic review of the   methods of surgical treatment which have been reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic search was performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and   the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. For inclusion,   studies required a minimum of ten patients with a Vancouver type   B2 and/or ten patients with a Vancouver type B3 fracture, a minimum   mean follow-up of two years and outcomes which were matched to the type   of fracture. Studies were also required to report the rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation   as an outcome measure. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO   database. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 22 studies were included based on the eligibility   criteria, including 343 B2 fractures and 167 B3 fractures. The mean   follow-up ranged from 32 months to 74 months. </p><p>Of 343 Vancouver B2 fractures, the treatment in 298 (86.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and 45 (12.6%) were treated with internal   fixation alone. A total of 37 patients (12.4%) treated with revision   arthroplasty and six (13.3%) treated by internal fixation only underwent   further re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. </p><p>Of 167 Vancouver B3 fractures, the treatment in 160 (95.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and eight (4.8%) were treated with internal   fixation without revision. A total of 23 patients (14.4%) treated   with revision arthroplasty and two (28.6%) treated only with internal   fixation required re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A significant proportion, particularly of B2 fractures, were   treated without revision of the stem. These were associated with   a higher rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. The treatment of B3 fractures without   revision of the stem resulted in a high rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. This   demonstrates the importance of careful evaluation and accurate characterisation   of the fracture at the time of presentation to ensure the correct   management. There is a need for improvement in the reporting of   data in case series recording the outcome of the surgical treatment   of periprosthetic fractures. We have suggested a minimum dataset   to improve the quality of data in studies dealing with these fractures.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):17–25.</p></sec>

Pre-operative functional mobility as an independent determinant of inpatient functional recovery after total knee arthroplasty during three periods that coincided with changes in clinical pathways
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>To investigate whether pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative functional mobility is a   determinant of delayed inpatient recovery of activities (IRoA) after   total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in three periods that coincided with   changes in the clinical pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients (n = 682, 73% women, mean age 70 years, standard   deviation 9) scheduled for TKA between 2009 and 2015 were pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   screened for functional mobility by the Timed-up-and-Go test (TUG)   and De Morton mobility index (DEMMI).

Distribution of Estimated 10-Year Risk of Recurrent Vascular Events and Residual Risk in a Secondary Prevention Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Among patients with clinically manifest vascular disease, the risk of recurrent vascular events is likely to vary. We assessed the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events in a secondary prevention population. We also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated the potential risk reduction and residual risk that can be achieved if patients reach guideline-recommended risk factor targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The SMART score (Second Manifestations of Arterial Disease) for 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death was applied to 6904 patients with vascular disease. The risk score was externally validated in 18 436 patients with various manifestations of vascular disease from the TNT (Treating to New Targets), IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels), and CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) trials. The residual risk at guideline-recommended targets was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated by applying relative risk reductions from meta-analyses to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated risk for targets for systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, and use of antithrombotic agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The external performance of the SMART risk score was reasonable, apart from over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation of risk in patients with 10-year risk >40%. In patients with various manifestations of vascular disease, median 10-year risk of a recurrent major vascular event was 17% (interquartile range, 11%–28%), varying from <10% in 18% to >30% in 22% of the patients. If risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, the residual 10-year risk would be <10% in 47% and >30% in 9% of the patients (median, 11%; interquartile range, 7%–17%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with vascular disease, there is very substantial variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events. If all modifiable risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, half of the patients would have a 10-year risk <10%.

A Kaplan-Meier analysis was undertaken to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four patients (four hips) died and 18 patients (20 hips) were   lost to follow-up within five years. The remaining 252 patients   (286 hips) were followed for a mean of 66.5 months (60 to 84). There   were 144 men (166 hips) and 108 women (120 hips) with a mean age   of 49.7 years (16 to 83) at surgery.

One hip was revised because of   fracture of the ceramic liner, which occurred due to an undetected   malseating of the ceramic liner at the time of surgery. One hip   was revised for a periprosthetic fracture of the femur, and one   hip was treated for periprosthetic joint infection. The six-year survivorship   with re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation for any reason as the endpoint was 99.0% (95%   confidence interval 97.8% to 100%).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The rate of delta ceramic fracture was 0.3% (one of 286).

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteoarthritis   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Our aim was to   investigate the long-term outcome of a consecutive series of patients,   some of whom had anterior knee pain and PFJ OA managed with UKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We assessed the ten-year functional outcomes and 15-year implant   survival of 805 knees (677 patients) following medial mobile-bearing   UKA. The intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative status of the PFJ was documented and, with   the exception of bone loss with grooving to the lateral side, neither   the clinical or radiological state of the PFJ nor the presence of   anterior knee pain were considered a contraindication. The impact   of radiographic findings and anterior knee pain was studied in a   subgroup of 100 knees (91 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no relationship between functional outcomes, at a mean   of ten years, or 15-year implant survival, and pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative anterior   knee pain, or the presence or degree of cartilage loss documented   intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively at the medial patella or trochlea, or radiographic   evidence of OA in the medial side of the PFJ. In 6% of cases there   was full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral side of the patella.   In these cases, the overall ten-year function and 15-year survival   was similar to those without cartilage loss; however they had slightly   more difficulty with descending stairs. Radiographic signs of OA   seen in the lateral part of the PFJ were not associated with a definite   compromise in functional outcome or implant survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ with bone loss and   grooving remains a contraindication to mobile-bearing UKA. Less   severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ and damage to the medial   side, however severe, does not compromise the overall function or   survival, so should not be considered to be a contraindication. However,   if a patient does have full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral   side of the PFJ they may have a slight compromise in their ability   to descend stairs. Pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative anterior knee pain also does not   compromise the functional outcome or survival and should not be   considered to be a contraindication.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:632–9</p></sec>

The stability of the hip after the use of a proximal femoral endoprosthesis for oncological indications
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Instability of the hip is the most common mode of failure after   reconstruction with a proximal femoral arthroplasty (PFA) using   an endoprosthesis after excision of a tumour. Small studies report   improved stability with capsular repair of the hip and other techniques,   but these have not been investigated in a large series of patients.   The aim of this study was to evaluate variables associated with   the patient and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation that affect post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative stability.   We hypothesised an association between capsular repair and stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective cohort study, we identified 527 adult patients   who were treated with a PFA for tumours. Our data included demographics,   the pathological diagnosis, the amount of resection of the abductor   muscles, the techniques of reconstruction and the characteristics   of the implant. We used regression analysis to compare patients   with and without post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 20 patients out of 527 (4%) had instability which   presented at a mean of 35 days (3 to 131) post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. Capsular   repair was not associated with a reduced rate of instability. Bivariate   analysis showed that a posterolateral surgical approach (odds ratio   (OR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.86) and the type   of implant (p = 0.046) had a significant association with reduced   instability; age > 60 years predicted instability (OR 3.17, 95%   CI 1.00 to 9.98). Multivariate analysis showed age > 60 years (OR   5.09, 95% CI 1.23 to 21.07), female gender (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.04   to 2.89), a malignant primary bone tumour (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.06   to 3.95), and benign condition (OR 5.56, 95% CI 1.35 to 22.90),   but not metastatic disease or soft-tissue tumours, predicted instability,   while a posterolateral approach (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.53) was   protective against instability. No instability occurred when a synthetic   graft was used in 70 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Stability of the hip after PFA is influenced by variables associated   with the patient, the pathology, the surgical technique and the   implant. We did not find an association between capsular repair   and improved stability. Extension of the tumour often dictates surgical   technique; however, our results indicate that PFA using a posterolateral   approach with a hemiarthroplasty and synthetic augment for soft-tissue   repair confers the lowest risk of instability. Patients who are   elderly, female, or with a primary benign or malignant bone tumour   should be counselled about an increased risk of instability.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:531–7.</p></sec>

Risk factors for post-operative periprosthetic fractures following primary total hip arthroplasty with a proximally coated double-tapered cementless femoral component
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify patient- and surgery-related   risk factors for sustaining an early periprosthetic fracture following   primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) performed using a double-tapered   cementless femoral component (Bi-Metric femoral stem; Biomet Inc.,   Warsaw, Indiana).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 1598 consecutive hips, in 1441 patients receiving   primary THA between January 2010 and June 2015, were retrospectively   identified. Level of pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative osteoarthritis, femoral Dorr   type and cortical index were recorded. Varus/valgus placement of   the stem and canal fill ratio were recorded post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.

Regression analysis was performed to identify risk   factors for early periprosthetic fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 713 days (1 to 2058). A total of 48 periprosthetic   fractures (3.0%) were identified during the follow-up and median   time until fracture was 16 days, (interquartile range 10 to 31.5).   Patients with femoral Dorr type C had a 5.2 times increased risk   of post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative periprosthetic fracture compared with type B,   while female patients had a near significant two times increased   risk over time for post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dorr type C is an independent risk factor for early periprosthetic   fracture, following THA using a double tapered cementless stem such   as the Bi-Metric.

Can we predict which dysplastic hips will require acetabular augmentation during total hip arthroplasty based on pre-operative radiographs?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an innovative   templating technique could predict the need for acetabular augmentation   during primary total hip arthroplasty for patients with dysplastic   hips.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We developed a simple templating technique to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate acetabular   component coverage at total hip arthroplasty, the True Cup: False   Cup (TC:FC) ratio. We reviewed all patients with dysplastic hips   who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty between 2005 and 2012.   Traditional radiological methods of assessing the degree of acetabular dysplasia   (Sharp’s angle, Tönnis angle, centre-edge angle) as well as the   TC:FC ratio were measured from the pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative radiographs. A   comparison of augmented and non-augmented hips was undertaken to   determine any difference in pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative radiological indices between   the two cohorts. The intra- and inter-observer reliability for all   radiological indices used in the study were also calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 128 cases reviewed, 33 (26%) needed acetabular augmentation.   We found no difference in the median Sharp’s angle (p = 0.10), Tönnis   angle (p = 0.28), or centre-edge angle (p = 0.07) between the two   groups. A lower TC:FC ratio was observed in the augmented group   compared with the non-augmented group (median = 0.66 <i>versus</i> 0.88, p < 0.001).   Intra-observer reliability was found to be high for all radiological   indices analysed (interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.7).   However, inter-observer reliability was more variable and was only   high for the TC: FC ratio (ICC > 0.7).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The TC: FC ratio gives an accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate of acetabular component   coverage.

Proximal femoral replacement in contemporary revision total hip arthroplasty for severe femoral bone loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Loss or absence of proximal femoral bone in revision total hip   arthroplasty (THA) remains a significant challenge. While the main   indication for the use of proximal femoral replacements (PFRs) is   in the treatment of malignant disease, they have a valuable role   in revision THA for loosening, fracture and infection in patients   with bone loss. Our aim was to determine the clinical outcomes,   implant survivorship, and complications of PFRs used in revision   THA for indications other than malignancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review of 44 patients who underwent revision   THA using a PFR between 2000 and 2013 was undertaken. Their mean   age was 79 years (53 to 97); 31 (70%) were women. The bone loss   was classified as Paprosky IIIB or IV in all patients. The mean   follow-up was six years (2 to 12), at which time 22 patients had   died and five were lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean Harris Hip Score improved from 42.8 (25.9 to 82.9) pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   to 68.5 (21.0 to 87.7) post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively (p = 0.0009). A total of   two PFRs had been revised, one for periprosthetic infection eight   years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively and one for aseptic loosening six years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.   The Kaplan-Meier survivorship free of any revision or removal of   an implant was 86% at five years and 66% years at ten years.

While the survivorship   of the implant is good at five years, dislocation continues to be   the most common complication. The judicious use of larger femoral   heads, dual-mobility constructs, or constrained liners may help   to minimise the risk of dislocation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:325–9.</p></sec>

Defining modes of failure after joint-preserving surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Joint-preserving surgery of the hip (JPSH) has evolved considerably   and now includes a number of procedures, including arthroscopy,   surgical dislocation, and redirectional osteotomies of the femur   and acetabulum. There are a number of different factors which lead   to failure of JPSH. Consequently, it is of interest to assess the   various modes of failure in order to continue to identify best practice   and the indications for these procedures. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using a retrospective observational study design, we reviewed   1013 patients who had undergone JPSH by a single surgeon between   2005 and 2015. There were 509 men and 504 women with a mean age   of 39 years (16 to 78). Of the 1013 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations, 783 were arthroscopies,   122 surgical dislocations, and 108 peri-acetabular osteotomies (PAO).   We analysed the overall failure rates and modes of failure. Re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations   were categorised into four groups: Mode 1 was arthritis progression   or organ failure leading to total hip arthroplasty (THA); Mode 2   was an Incorrect diagnosis/procedure; Mode 3 resulted from malcorrection   of femur (type A), acetabulum (type B), or labrum (type C) and Mode 4   resulted from an unintended consequence of the initial surgical   intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, there had been 104 re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations   (10.2%) with a mean patient age of 35.5 years (17 to 64). There   were 64 Mode 1 failures (6.3%) at a mean of 3.2 years following   JPSH with a mean patient age of 46.8 years (18 to 64). There were   17 Mode 2 failures (1.7%) at a mean of 2.2 years post-JPSH with   a mean patient age of 28.9 years (17 to 42) (2% scopes; 1% surgical   dislocations). There were 19 Mode 3 failures (1.9%) at a mean of   2.0 years post-JPSH, with a mean patient age of 29.9 years (18 to   51) (2% scopes; 2% surgical dislocations; 5% PAO). There were 4   Mode 4 failures (0.4%) at a mean of 1.8 years post-JPSH with a mean   patient age of 31.5 years (15 to 43). Using the modified Dindo-Clavien   classification system, the overall complication rate among JPSHs   was 4.2%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While defining the overall re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation and complication rates,   it is important to define the safety and effectiveness of JPSH.

Is computer navigation when used in the surgery of iliosacral pelvic bone tumours safer for the patient?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Due to the complex anatomy of the pelvis, limb-sparing resections   of pelvic tumours achieving adequate surgical margins, can often   be difficult. The advent of computer navigation has improved the   precision of resection of these lesions, though there is little   evidence comparing resection with or without the assistance of navigation.</p><p>Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of navigation-assisted surgery   for the resection of pelvic bone tumours involving the posterior   ilium and sacrum. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using our prospectively updated institutional database, we conducted   a retrospective case control study of 21 patients who underwent   resection of the posterior ilium and sacrum, for the treatment of   a primary sarcoma of bone, between 1987 and 2015. The resection   was performed with the assistance of navigation in nine patients   and without navigation in 12. We assessed the accuracy of navigation-assisted   surgery, as defined by the surgical margin and how this affects   the rate of local recurrence, the disease-free survival and the   effects on peri-and post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative morbidity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the patients was 36.4 years (15 to 66). The mean   size of the tumour was 10.9 cm. In the navigation-assisted group,   the margin was wide in two patients (16.7%), marginal in six (66.7%)   and wide-contaminated in one (11.1%) with no intralesional margin.   In the non-navigated-assisted group; the margin was wide in two   patients (16.7%), marginal in five (41.7%), intralesional in three   (25.0%) and wide-contaminated in two (16.7%). Local recurrence occurred   in two patients in the navigation-assisted group (22.2%) and six   in the non-navigation-assisted group (50.0%).

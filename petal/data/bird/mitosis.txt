Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is a common feature of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e and Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e does not recombine with the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution in this lineage.</p>

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in cancer genomics is identifying “driver” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions from the many neutral “passenger” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions within a given tumor. To identify driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that would otherwise be lost within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 tumor-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were identified on the basis of amino acid conservation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-cancer analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, despite its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional frequency falling within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional noise for this cancer type. The majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric cancer cells harboring LOF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric cancer. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional cancer driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and define the JNK pathway as tumor-suppressive in gastric cancer.</p>

Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional differentiation of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and is thus a crucial step in the process of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which diverged from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es based on comparative analyses of these divergent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e-wide differentiation patterns and phylogenetic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es were extensively differentiated before the divergence of these lineages. In contrast, genetic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al regions exhibiting genetic differentiation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is a ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e termed extra circular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

In addition, desmin, and intercalar disc–related proteins expression were histologically analyzed in explanted cardiac tissue affected by the <i>DES</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion.

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease genetics, and conservation biology. To estimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates and evaluate the effect of selection on new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, we propagated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Genome-Wide Biases in the Rate and Molecular Spectrum of Spontaneous Mutations in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>
<p>The vast diversity in nucleotide composition and architecture among bacterial genomes may be partly explained by inherent biases in the rates and spectra of spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. Bacterial genomes with multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es are relatively unusual but some are relevant to human health, none more so than the causative agent of cholera, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Here, we present the genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion spectra in wild-type and mismatch repair (MMR) defective backgrounds of two <i>Vibrio</i> species, the low-%GC squid symbiont <i>V. fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>V. cholerae</i>, collected under conditions that greatly minimize the efficiency of natural selection. In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have among the lowest rates for base-substitution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (bpsms) and insertion–deletion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (indels) that have been measured, below 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup>/genome/generation. <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion spectra, but both are AT-biased and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion spectra of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion patterns. Bpsm and indel rates varied among genome regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary rates of genes on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e 2, which likely result from weaker purifying selection. More generally, the very low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates of <i>Vibrio</i> species correlate inversely with their immense population sizes and suggest that selection may not only have maximized replication fidelity but also optimized other polygenic traits relative to the constraints of genetic drift.</p>

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.

The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in cancer genomes, providing new insights into how and in what ways cancer can develop and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, genetic errors in cancer cells that reveal basic biological processes gone awry that are required for cancer initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the genetic changes that are present in their tumors (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that cancer genomes harbor many additional “passenger” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (<i>4</i>). Patterns of driver and passenger DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions derived from cancer genomes have provided clues about the different ways that cancer can manifest as a disease of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental carcinogens (for example, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion patterns caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional patterns can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a tumor to develop (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in normal tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions arise in normal tissues but do not necessarily lead to cancer.</p>

Mutation dynamics and fitness effects followed in single cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions have been investigated for more than a century but remain difficult to observe directly in single cells, which limits the characterization of their dynamics and fitness effects. By combining microfluidics, time-lapse imaging, and a fluorescent tag of the mismatch repair system in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we visualized the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in single cells, revealing Poissonian dynamics. Concomitantly, we tracked the growth and life span of single cells, accumulating ~20,000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions genome-wide over hundreds of generations. This analysis revealed that 1% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were lethal; nonlethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions displayed a heavy-tailed distribution of fitness effects and were dominated by quasi-neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions with an average cost of 0.3%. Our approach has enabled the investigation of single-cell individuality in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion fitness costs, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion interactions.</p>

Competing chromosomes explain junk DNA
<p>The vast majority of eukaryotes have two copies of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e and reproduce sexually. Meiosis is a vital process that produces gametes (eggs and sperm) by reducing the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e copies to one; fertilization between egg and sperm restores the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e copy number to two. During female meiosis, one set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es is expelled into a tiny cell called a polar body, whereas the other is segregated into the egg. It is a fundamental tenet of genetics that there is a random, 50% chance for any particular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e to be segregated into the egg versus the polar body. However, cases in which one copy of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is inherited with greater than 50% frequency have been reported in many species (<i>1</i>), but the molecular mechanism of this preferential inheritance has remained obscure. Recent work has indicated that centromeres, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al regions that form attachments to microtubules that mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation during meiosis, compete with each other for inheritance during female meiosis (<i>2</i>). Thus, the essential DNA sequences that mediate accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation are actually “selfish” (or parasitic) genetic elements that have invaded our genome. On page 668 of this issue, Akera <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) provide the most detailed molecular mechanism to date that explains how a parasitic DNA sequence has used the asymmetry of oocyte meiosis to ensure its own inheritance and therefore its spread through populations.</p>

Global Analysis of Gene Expression in Response to Whole-Chromosome Aneuploidy in Hexaploid Wheat
<p>Aneuploidy, a condition of unbalanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e content, represents a large-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion that bears significant relevance to human health and microbe adaptation. As such, extensive studies of aneuploidy have been conducted in unicellular model organisms and cancer cells. Aneuploidy also frequently is associated with plant polyploidization, but its impact on gene expression and its relevance to polyploid genome evolution/functional innovation remain largely unknown. Here, we used a panel of diverse types of whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e aneuploidy of hexaploid wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), all under the common genetic background of cv Chinese Spring, to systemically investigate the impact of aneuploidy on genome-, subgenome-, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e-wide gene expression. Compared with prior findings in haploid or diploid aneuploid systems, we unravel additional and novel features of alteration in global gene expression resulting from the two major impacts of aneuploidy, cis- and trans-regulation, as well as dosage compensation. We show that the expression-altered genes map evenly along each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e, with no evidence for coregulating aggregated expression domains. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and subgenomes in hexaploid wheat are unequal in their responses to aneuploidy with respect to the number of genes being dysregulated. Strikingly, homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es do not differ from nonhomologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es in terms of aneuploidy-induced trans-acting effects, suggesting that the three constituent subgenomes of hexaploid wheat are largely uncoupled at the transcriptional level of gene regulation. Together, our findings shed new insights into the functional interplay between homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and interactions between subgenomes in hexaploid wheat, which bear implications to further our understanding of allopolyploid genome evolution and efforts in breeding new allopolyploid crops.</p>

Histone Lys-to-Met (K-to-M) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions act as gain-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions to inhibit a wide range of histone methyltransferases and are thought to promote tumorigenesis. However, it is largely unknown whether K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions impact organismal development. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a model system, we discovered that a transgene exogenously expressing histone 3 Lys-36 to Met <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion (K36M) acts in a dominant-negative manner to cause global reduction of H3K36 methylation. Remarkably, this dominant repressive activity is dosage-dependent and causes strong developmental perturbations including extreme branching and early flowering by affecting the expression of genes involved in developmental and metabolic processes. Besides the established pathological roles of K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in tumor cells, we demonstrate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical outcome for K-to-M induced H3K36 hypomethylation. This study provides evidence for a conserved dominant-negative inhibitory role of histone K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion across the plant and animal kingdoms. We also highlight the unique ability of K36M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions to alter plant developmental processes leading to severe pleiotropic phenotypes. Finally, our data suggests K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions may provide a useful strategy for altering epigenetic landscapes in organisms where histone methyltransferases are uncharacterized.</p>

Scanning for New BRI1 Mutations via TILLING Analysis
<p>The identification and characterization of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional spectrum for a specific protein can help to elucidate its detailed cellular functions. BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), a multidomain transmembrane receptor-like kinase, is a major receptor of brassinosteroids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Within the last two decades, over 20 different <i>bri1</i> mutant alleles have been identified, which helped to determine the significance of each domain within BRI1. To further understand the molecular mechanisms of BRI1, we tried to identify additional alleles via targeted induced local lesions in genomes. Here, we report our identification of 83 new point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>BRI1</i>, including nine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that exhibit an allelic series of typical <i>bri1</i> phenotypes, from subtle to severe morphological alterations. We carried out biochemical analyses to investigate possible mechanisms of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in affecting brassinosteroid signaling. A number of interesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions have been isolated via this study. For example, <i>bri1-702</i>, the only weak allele identified so far with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in the activation loop, showed reduced autophosphorylation activity. <i>bri1-705</i>, a subtle allele with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in the extracellular portion, disrupts the interaction of BRI1 with its ligand brassinolide and coreceptor BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1. <i>bri1-706</i>, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in the extracellular portion, is a subtle defective mutant. Surprisingly, root inhibition analysis indicated that it is largely insensitive to exogenous brassinolide treatment. In this study, we found that <i>bri1-301</i> possesses kinase activity in vivo, clarifying a previous report arguing that kinase activity may not be necessary for the function of BRI1. These data provide additional insights into our understanding of the early events in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate gene expression in eukaryotes, but their roles in gene expression changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es at the single cell level and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for analyzing individual genes. Here, we comparatively analyzed immunostained metaphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and ChIP-seq of individual genes, which revealed a chromatin basis for biased homoeologous gene expression in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed genes between the two subgenomes. However, intensities per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>ical observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with biased modifications correlated with the greater number of the genes with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e pairs. Two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es displayed different expression levels compared with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local chromatin structure and expression levels for the genes involved. This example of genome-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous genes in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates suggests an approximate constancy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate in insects.</p>

A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion’s effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional tolerance, and evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional effects on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

Female Mice With an XY Sex Chromosome Complement Develop Severe Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a deadly pathology with strong sexual dimorphism. Similar to humans, female mice exhibit far lower incidences of angiotensin II–induced AAAs than males. In addition to sex hormones, the X and Y sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, and their unique complements of genes, may contribute to sexually dimorphic AAA pathology. Here, we defined the effect of female (XX) versus male (XY) sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e complement on angiotensin II–induced AAA formation and rupture in phenotypically female mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Female low-density lipoprotein receptor (<i>Ldlr</i>) deficient mice with an XX or XY sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e complement were infused with angiotensin II for 28 days to induce AAAs. Abdominal aortic lumen diameters were quantified by ultrasound, whereas AAA diameters were quantified at study end point. DNA microarrays were performed on abdominal aortas. To mimic males, female mice were administered a single dose of testosterone as neonates or as adults before angiotensin II infusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Female <i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup> deficient mice with an XX and XY sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e complement had similar sex organ weights and low serum testosterone concentrations. Abdominal aortas from female XY mice selectively expressed Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e genes, whereas genes known to escape X inactivation were higher in XX females. The majority of aortic gene differences in XY versus XX females fell within inflammatory pathways. AAA incidences doubled and aneurysms ruptured in XY females. AAAs from XY females exhibited inflammation, and plasma interleukin-1β concentrations were increased in XY females. Moreover, aortas from XY females had augmented matrix metalloproteinase activity and increased oxidative stress. Last, testosterone exposure applied chronically, or as a single bolus at postnatal day 1, markedly worsened AAA outcomes in XY in comparison with XX adult females.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An XY sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e complement in phenotypic females profoundly influenced aortic gene expression profiles and promoted AAA severity. When XY females were exposed to testosterone, aneurysm rupture rates were striking. Mechanisms for augmented AAA severity in XY females include increased inflammation, augmented matrix metalloproteineases, and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that genes on the sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es regulate aortic vascular biology and contribute to sexual dimorphism of AAAs.

Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 induce hydrocephalus in a catalytically dependent manner
<p>Catalytically activating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>Ptpn11</i>, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause 50% of Noonan syndrome (NS) cases, whereas inactivating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>Ptpn11</i> are responsible for nearly all cases of the similar, but distinct, developmental disorder Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML; formerly called LEOPARD syndrome). However, both types of disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are gain-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions because they cause SHP2 to constitutively adopt an open conformation. We found that the catalytic activity of SHP2 was required for the pathogenic effects of gain-of-function, disease-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions on the development of hydrocephalus in the mouse. Targeted pan-neuronal knockin of a <i>Ptpn11</i> allele encoding the active SHP2 E76K mutant resulted in hydrocephalus due to aberrant development of ependymal cells and their cilia. These pathogenic effects of the E76K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion were suppressed by the additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion C459S, which abolished the catalytic activity of SHP2. Moreover, ependymal cells in NSML mice bearing the inactive SHP2 mutant Y279C were also unaffected. Mechanistically, the SHP2 E76K mutant induced developmental defects in ependymal cells by enhancing dephosphorylation and inhibition of the transcription activator STAT3. Whereas STAT3 activity was reduced in <i>Ptpn11</i><sup><i>E76K/+</i></sup> cells, the activities of the kinases ERK and AKT were enhanced, and neural cell–specific <i>Stat3</i> knockout mice also manifested developmental defects in ependymal cells and cilia. These genetic and biochemical data demonstrate a catalytic-dependent role of SHP2 gain-of-function disease mutants in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus.</p>

Mutated clones are the new normal
<p>Cancers are formed by the expansion of harmful “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional clones,” which are cell populations carrying the same DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. How harmful they are depends on which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ed genes they contain. On page 970 of this issue, Yizhak <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) add to the evidence that normal tissues are not so normal after all. Examining a substantial number of healthy tissues from almost 500 individuals, they found a large number of acquired (somatic) DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions—some of which are typically associated with cancer—and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional clones of macroscopic size, in the absence of cancer pathology. The presence in normal tissues of clonal cell populations, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in cancer-associated genes, is informative about how a tumor evolves from the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion to a benign growth and, finally, to cancer.</p>

Somatic mutant clones colonize the human esophagus with age
<p>The extent to which cells in normal tissues accumulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions throughout life is poorly understood. Some mutant cells expand into clones that can be detected by genome sequencing. We mapped mutant clones in normal esophageal epithelium from nine donors (age range, 20 to 75 years). Somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions accumulated with age and were caused mainly by intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional processes. We found strong positive selection of clones carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in 14 cancer genes, with tens to hundreds of clones per square centimeter. In middle-aged and elderly donors, clones with cancer-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions covered much of the epithelium, with <i>NOTCH1</i> and <i>TP53</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions affecting 12 to 80% and 2 to 37% of cells, respectively. Unexpectedly, the prevalence of <i>NOTCH1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in normal esophagus was several times higher than in esophageal cancers. These findings have implications for our understanding of cancer and aging.</p>

Fertile offspring from sterile sex chromosome trisomic mice
<p>Having the correct number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es is vital for normal development and health. Sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e trisomy affects 0.1% of the human population and is associated with infertility. We show that during reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), fibroblasts from sterile trisomic XXY and XYY mice lose the extra sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e through a phenomenon we term trisomy-biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e loss (TCL).

Sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e loss is comparatively infrequent during mouse XX and XY iPSC generation. TCL also applies to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, generating euploid iPSCs from cells of a Down syndrome mouse model. It can also create euploid iPSCs from human trisomic patient fibroblasts. The findings have relevance to overcoming infertility and other trisomic phenotypes.</p>

Actin protects mammalian eggs against chromosome segregation errors
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation is driven by a spindle that is made of microtubules but is generally thought to be independent of actin. Here, we report an unexpected actin-dependent mechanism that drives the accurate alignment and segregation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es in mammalian eggs. Prominent actin filaments permeated the microtubule spindle in eggs of several mammalian species, including humans. Disrupting actin in mouse eggs led to significantly increased numbers of misaligned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es as well as lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es during meiosis I and II. We found that actin drives accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation by promoting the formation of functional kinetochore fibers, the microtubule bundles that align and segregate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. Thus, actin is essential to prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation errors in eggs, which are a leading cause of miscarriages, infertility, and Down syndrome.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Understanding and Manipulating Meiotic Recombination in Plants
<p>Meiosis is a specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell divis</span></strong>ion, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is homologous recombination, which promotes homologous pairing and generates crossovers (COs) to connect homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>ically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding program depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e size. Moreover, their positions are not random on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the generation of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding programs. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to observe an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental population genetic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions including common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions confer resistance providing a large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional target—we estimate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be estimated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> estimated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously underestimated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may underestimate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously estimated.</p>

A calcium-sensing receptor mutation causing hypocalcemia disrupts a transmembrane salt bridge to activate β-arrestin–biased signaling
<p>The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals through G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> to stimulate cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub>) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling to control extracellular calcium homeostasis. Studies of loss- and gain-of-function <i>CASR</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, which cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1) and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1), respectively, have revealed that the CaSR signals in a biased manner. Thus, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions associated with FHH1 lead to signaling predominantly through the MAPK pathway, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions associated with ADH1 preferentially enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> responses. We report a previously unidentified ADH1-associated R680G CaSR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion, which led to the identification of a CaSR structural motif that mediates biased signaling. Expressing CaSR<sup>R680G</sup> in HEK 293 cells showed that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion increased MAPK signaling without altering Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> responses. Moreover, this gain of function in MAPK activity occurred independently of G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> and was mediated instead by a noncanonical pathway involving β-arrestin proteins. Homology modeling and mutagenesis studies showed that the R680G CaSR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion selectively enhanced β-arrestin signaling by disrupting a salt bridge formed between Arg<sup>680</sup> and Glu<sup>767</sup>, which are located in CaSR transmembrane domain 3 and extracellular loop 2, respectively. Thus, our results demonstrate CaSR signaling through β-arrestin and the importance of the Arg<sup>680</sup>-Glu<sup>767</sup> salt bridge in mediating signaling bias.</p>

Human mutation rate a legacy from our past
<p>Humans should be more like paramecia. That's because their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate is orders of magnitude lower than a human's. Those rates increase when genes involved in copying or repairing DNA stop working correctly. Although some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are good for generating variety that allows organisms to adapt to changing environments, too many can cause disease and birth defects. At a meeting in Tempe, Arizona, researchers documented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates in dozens of species and found that the species's specific rate is inversely related to the so-called "effective population" size. Small populations are less able to get rid of or compensate for genetic changes that increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate. In the past, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates were thought to be so stable that they were "molecular clocks" useful for dating species' divergences. But researchers are now recognizing that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates vary from species to species.</p>

Use of CRISPR-modified human stem cell organoids to study the origin of mutational signatures in cancer
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional processes underlie cancer initiation and progression. Signatures of these processes in cancer genomes may explain cancer etiology and could hold diagnostic and prognostic value. We developed a strategy that can be used to explore the origin of cancer-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional signatures. We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair genes in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion accumulation in organoids deficient in the mismatch repair gene <i>MLH1</i> is driven by replication errors and accurately models the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion profiles observed in mismatch repair–deficient colorectal cancers. Application of this strategy to the cancer predisposition gene <i>NTHL1</i>, which encodes a base excision repair protein, revealed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional footprint (signature 30) previously observed in a breast cancer cohort. We show that signature 30 can arise from germline <i>NTHL1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions.</p>

Control of meiotic pairing and recombination by chromosomally tethered 26<i>S</i> proteasome
<p>During meiosis, paired homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es (homologs) become linked via the synaptonemal complex (SC) and crossovers. Crossovers mediate homolog segregation and arise from self-inflicted double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we identified a role for the proteasome, the multisubunit protease that degrades proteins in the nucleus and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>, in homolog juxtaposition and crossing over. Without proteasome function, homologs failed to pair and instead remained associated with nonhomologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. Although dispensable for noncrossover formation, a functional proteasome was required for a coordinated transition that entails SC assembly between longitudinally organized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e axes and stable strand exchange of crossover-designated DSBs. Notably, proteolytic core and regulatory proteasome particles were recruited to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es by Zip3, the ortholog of mammalian E3 ligase RNF212, and SC protein Zip1 . We conclude that proteasome functions along meiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es are evolutionarily conserved.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of gene expression, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) genes on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these gene families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the genetic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> genes moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the <i>TCP4</i> gene conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> genes, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> genes cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream gene transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

Physical Mapping of Amplified Copies of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Glyphosate-Resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Recent and rapid evolution of resistance to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicides, in several weed species, including common waterhemp (<i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>), poses a serious threat to sustained crop production. We report that glyphosate resistance in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> was due to amplification of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-P synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) gene, which encodes the molecular target of glyphosate. There was a positive correlation between <i>EPSPS</i> gene copies and its transcript expression. We analyzed the distribution of <i>EPSPS</i> copies in the genome of <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> using fluorescence in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and interphase nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis mapped the <i>EPSPS</i> gene to pericentromeric regions of two homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es in glyphosate sensitive <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>. In glyphosate-resistant plants, a cluster of <i>EPSPS</i> genes on the pericentromeric region on one pair of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es was detected. Intriguingly, two highly glyphosate-resistant plants harbored an additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e with several <i>EPSPS</i> copies besides the native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e pair with <i>EPSPS</i> copies. These results suggest that the initial event of <i>EPSPS</i> gene duplication may have occurred because of unequal recombination mediated by repetitive DNA. Subsequently, gene amplification may have resulted via several other mechanisms, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al rearrangements, deletion/insertion, transposon-mediated dispersion, or possibly by interspecific hybridization. This report illustrates the physical mapping of amplified <i>EPSPS</i> copies in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Y Chromosome Analysis of Dingoes and Southeast Asian Village Dogs Suggests a Neolithic Continental Expansion from Southeast Asia Followed by Multiple Austronesian Dispersals
<p>Dogs originated more than 14,000 BP, but the location(s) where they first arose is uncertain. The earliest archeological evidence of ancient dogs was discovered in Europe and the Middle East, some 5–7 millennia before that from Southeast Asia. However, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that most modern dogs derive from Southeast Asia, which has fueled the controversial hypothesis that dog domestication originated in this region despite the lack of supporting archeological evidence. We propose and investigate with Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es an alternative hypothesis for the proximate origins of dogs from Southeast Asia—a massive Neolithic expansion of dogs from this region that largely replaced more primitive dogs to the west and north. Previous attempts to test matrilineal findings with independent patrilineal markers have lacked the necessary genealogical resolution and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate estimates. Here, we used Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e genotypes, composed of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 5 single tandem repeats (STRs), from 338 Australian dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, and village dogs from Island Southeast Asia, along with modern European breed dogs, to estimate the evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates of Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e STRs based on calibration to the independently known age of the dingo population. Dingoes exhibited a unique haplogroup characterized by a single distinguishing SNP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion and 14 STR haplotypes. The age of the European haplogroup was estimated to be only 1.7 times older than that of the dingo population, suggesting an origin during the Neolithic rather than the Paleolithic (as predicted by the Southeast Asian origins hypothesis). We hypothesize that isolation of Neolithic dogs from wolves in Southeast Asia was a key step accelerating their phenotypic transformation, enhancing their value in trade and as cargo, and enabling them to rapidly expand and replace more primitive dogs to the West. Our findings also suggest that dingoes could have arrived in Australia directly from Taiwan, independently of later dispersals of dogs through Thailand to Island Southeast Asia.</p>

Basal aurora kinase B activity is sufficient for histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase
<p>Histone H3 phosphorylation is the hallmark of mitosis deposited by aurora kinase B. Benzo[e]pyridoindoles are a family of potent, broad, ATP-competitive aurora kinase inhibitors. However, benzo[e]pyridoindole C4 only inhibits histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase but not in metaphase. Under the C4 treatment, the cells enter into mitosis with dephosphorylated histone H3, assemble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es normally and progress to metaphase, and then to anaphase. C4 also induces lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e in anaphase but we demonstrated that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e compaction defects are not related to the absence of H3 phosphorylation in prophase. As a result of C4 action, mitosis lasts longer and the cell cycle is slowed down.</p><p>We reproduced the mitotic defects with reduced concentrations of potent pan aurora kinase as well as with a specific aurora B ATP-competitive inhibitor; we therefore propose that histone H3 phosphorylation and anaphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e compaction involve the basal activity of aurora kinase B. Our data suggest that aurora kinase B is progressively activated at mitosis entry and at anaphase onset. The full activation of aurora kinase B by its partners, in prometaphase, induces a shift in the catalytic domain of aurora B that modifies its affinity for ATP. These waves of activation/deactivation of aurora B correspond to different conformations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al complex revealed by FRAP.</p><p>The presence of lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es may have deleterious consequences on the daughter cells and, unfortunately, the situation may be encountered in patients receiving treatment with aurora kinase inhibitors.</p>

Genetic diversity of tumors with mismatch repair deficiency influences anti–PD-1 immunotherapy response
<p>Tumors with mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-d) are characterized by sequence alterations in microsatellites and can accumulate thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. This high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional burden renders tumors immunogenic and sensitive to programmed cell death–1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors. Yet, despite their tumor immunogenicity, patients with MMR-deficient tumors experience highly variable responses, and roughly half are refractory to treatment. We present experimental and clinical evidence showing that the degree of microsatellite instability (MSI) and resultant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional load, in part, underlies the variable response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in MMR-d human and mouse tumors. The extent of response is particularly associated with the accumulation of insertion-deletion (indel) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional load. This study provides a rationale for the genome-wide characterization of MSI intensity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional load to better profile responses to anti–PD-1 immunotherapy across MMR-deficient human cancers.</p>

Genome-wide de novo risk score implicates promoter variation in autism spectrum disorder
<p>Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has facilitated the first genome-wide evaluations of the contribution of de novo noncoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions to complex disorders. Using WGS, we identified 255,106 de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions among sample genomes from members of 1902 quartet families in which one child, but not a sibling or their parents, was affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In contrast to coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, no noncoding functional annotation category, analyzed in isolation, was significantly associated with ASD. Casting noncoding variation in the context of a de novo risk score across multiple annotation categories, however, did demonstrate association with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions localized to promoter regions. We found that the strongest driver of this promoter signal emanates from evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites distal to the transcription start site. These data suggest that de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in promoter regions, characterized by evolutionary and functional signatures, contribute to ASD.</p>

Heterogeneity in efflux pump expression predisposes antibiotic-resistant cells to mutation
<p>Antibiotic resistance is often the result of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that block drug activity; however, bacteria also evade antibiotics by transiently expressing genes such as multidrug efflux pumps. A crucial question is whether transient resistance can promote permanent genetic changes. Previous studies have established that antibiotic treatment can select tolerant cells that then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>e to achieve permanent resistance. Whether these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions result from antibiotic stress or preexist within the population is unclear. To address this question, we focused on the multidrug pump AcrAB-TolC. Using time-lapse microscopy, we found that cells with higher <i>acrAB</i> expression have lower expression of the DNA mismatch repair gene <i>mutS</i>, lower growth rates, and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion frequencies. Thus, transient antibiotic resistance from elevated <i>acrAB</i> expression can promote spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions within single cells.</p>

A mitosis-specific and R loop–driven ATR pathway promotes faithful chromosome segregation
<p>The ataxia telangiectasia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ed and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase is crucial for DNA damage and replication stress responses. Here, we describe an unexpected role of ATR in mitosis. Acute inhibition or degradation of ATR in mitosis induces whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e missegregation. The effect of ATR ablation is not due to altered cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity, DNA damage responses, or unscheduled DNA synthesis but to loss of an ATR function at centromeres. In mitosis, ATR localizes to centromeres through Aurora A–regulated association with centromere protein F (CENP-F), allowing ATR to engage replication protein A (RPA)–coated centromeric R loops. As ATR is activated at centromeres, it stimulates Aurora B through Chk1, preventing formation of lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. Thus, a mitosis-specific and R loop–driven ATR pathway acts at centromeres to promote faithful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation, revealing functions of R loops and ATR in suppressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e instability.</p>

Stem cell divisions, somatic mutations, cancer etiology, and cancer prevention

We studied the relationship between the number of normal stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell divis</span></strong>ions and the risk of 17 cancer types in 69 countries throughout the world. The data revealed a strong correlation (median = 0.80) between cancer incidence and normal stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell divis</span></strong>ions in all countries, regardless of their environment. The major role of R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in cancer etiology was supported by an independent approach, based solely on cancer genome sequencing and epidemiological data, which suggested that R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are responsible for two-thirds of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in human cancers.

Mutational signatures associated with tobacco smoking in human cancer
<p>Tobacco smoking increases the risk of at least 17 classes of human cancer. We analyzed somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and DNA methylation in 5243 cancers of types for which tobacco smoking confers an elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion burdens of multiple distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional signatures, which contribute to different extents in different cancers. One of these signatures, mainly found in cancers derived from tissues directly exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to misreplication of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens. Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional process. Smoking is associated with limited differences in methylation. The results are consistent with the proposition that smoking increases cancer risk by increasing the somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion load, although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in some smoking-related cancer types.</p>

<p>Horseradish (<i>Armoracia rusticana</i>) and watercress (<i>Nasturtium officinale</i>) are economically important cruciferous vegetable species with limited genomic resources. We used comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e painting to identify the extent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al collinearity between horseradish and watercress, and to reconstruct the origin and evolution of the two tetraploid genomes (2<i>n</i> = 4<i>x</i> = 32). Our results show that horseradish and watercress genomes originated from a common ancestral (<i>n</i> = 8) genome, structurally resembling the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype (<i>n</i> = 8), which, however, contained two unique translocation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es (AK6/8 and AK8/6). Except for a 2.4-Mb unequal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e translocation in watercress, both genomes are structurally identical. The structural similarity of the two parental subgenomes might suggest an autotetraploid origin of horseradish and watercress genomes. The subgenome stasis, apart from the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e translocation, indicates that homeologous recombination played a limited role in postpolyploid evolution in both tetraploid genomes. The octoploid genome of one-rowed watercress (<i>N. microphyllum</i>, 2<i>n</i> = 8<i>x</i> = 64), structurally mirroring the tetraploid horseradish and watercress genomes, originated via autopolyploidization from the immediate tetraploid predecessor of watercress or hybridization between this and another now-extinct tetraploid <i>Nasturtium</i> species. These comparative cytogenomic maps in horseradish and watercress represent a first stepping stone for future whole-genome sequencing efforts and genetic improvement of both crop species.</p>

The Major Origin of Seedless Grapes Is Associated with a Missense Mutation in the MADS-Box Gene <i>VviAGL11</i>
<p>Seedlessness is greatly prized by consumers of fresh grapes. While stenospermocarpic seed abortion determined by the <i>SEED DEVELOPMENT INHIBITOR</i> (<i>SDI</i>) locus is the usual source of seedlessness in commercial grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) cultivars, the underlying <i>sdi</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion remains unknown. Here, we undertook an integrative approach to identify the causal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion. Quantitative genetics and fine-mapping in two ‘Crimson Seedless’-derived F1 mapping populations confirmed the major effect of the <i>SDI</i> locus and delimited the <i>sdi</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion to a 323-kb region on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e 18. RNA-sequencing comparing seed traces of seedless and seeds of seeded F1 individuals identified processes triggered during <i>sdi</i>-determined seed abortion, including the activation of salicylic acid-dependent autoimmunity. The RNA-sequencing data set was investigated for candidate genes, and while no evidence for causal cis-acting regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions was detected, deleterious nucleotide changes in coding sequences of the seedless haplotype were predicted in two genes within the <i>sdi</i> fine-mapping interval. Targeted resequencing of the two genes in a collection of 124 grapevine cultivars showed that only the point variation causing the arginine-197-to-leucine substitution in the seed morphogenesis regulator gene <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE11</i> (<i>VviAGL11</i>) was fully linked with stenospermocarpy. The concurrent postzygotic variation identified for this missense polymorphism and seedlessness phenotype in seeded somatic variants of the original stenospermocarpic cultivar supports a causal effect. We postulate that seed abortion caused by this amino acid substitution in VviAGL11 is the major cause of seedlessness in cultivated grapevine. This information can be exploited to boost seedless grape breeding.</p>

Sugar Potentiation of Fatty Acid and Triacylglycerol Accumulation
<p>Photosynthetically derived sugar provides carbon skeletons for lipid biosynthesis. We used mutants of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and the expression of oleogenic factors to investigate relationships among sugar availability, lipid synthesis, and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in leaf tissue. The <i>adg1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion disables the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the first step in starch synthesis, and the <i>suc2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion disables a sucrose/proton symporter that facilitates sucrose loading from leaves into phloem. The <i>adg1suc2</i> double mutant increases glucose plus sucrose content in leaves 80-fold relative to the wild type, total fatty acid (FA) content 1.8-fold to 8.3% dry weight, and TAG more than 10-fold to 1.2% dry weight. The WRINKLED1 transcription factor also accumulates to higher levels in these leaves, and the rate of FA synthesis increases by 58%. Adding <i>tt4</i>, which disables chalcone synthase, had little effect, but adding the <i>tgd1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion, which disables an importer of lipids into plastids to create <i>adg1suc2tt4tgd1</i>, increased total leaf FA to 13.5% dry weight and TAG to 3.8% dry weight, demonstrating a synergistic effect upon combining these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. Combining <i>adg1suc2</i> with the <i>sdp1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion, deficient in the predominant TAG lipase, had little effect on total FA content but increased the TAG accumulation by 66% to 2% dry weight. Expression of the <i>WRINKLED1</i> transcription factor, along with <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> and the <i>OLEOSIN1</i> oil body-associated protein, in the <i>adg1suc2</i> mutant doubled leaf FA content and increased TAG content to 2.3% dry weight, a level 4.6-fold higher than that resulting from expression of the same factors in the wild type.</p>

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis in plants enables the development of high-throughput mutagenesis strategies. By transforming pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were generated with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in 15 of the 18 targeted genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ed genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying targeted genes. Plants with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a collection of lines with targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and should be applicable to any plant transformation system.</p>

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral suppressors of RNA silencing induce developmental defects similar to those caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral suppressor-mediated developmental defects to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental defects in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral suppressors were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral suppressor-mediated developmental defects, using two independent <i>arf8</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral suppressor of silencing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F1 generation, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the phenotype in the F2 generation. However, the loss of phenotype in the F2 generation was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent loss-of-function point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 generations. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental defects caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

Genotype-Dependent and -Independent Calcium Signaling Dysregulation in Human Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Aberrant calcium signaling may contribute to arrhythmias and adverse remodeling in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in sarcomere genes may distinctly alter calcium handling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed gene expression, protein levels, and functional assays for calcium regulatory pathways in human HCM surgical samples with (n=25) and without (n=10) sarcomere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions compared with control hearts (n=8).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Gene expression and protein levels for calsequestrin, L-type calcium channel, sodium-calcium exchanger, phospholamban, calcineurin, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) were similar in HCM samples compared with controls. CaMKII protein abundance was increased only in sarcomere-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion HCM (<i>P</i><0.001). The CaMKII target pT17-phospholamban was 5.5-fold increased only in sarcomere-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion HCM (<i>P</i>=0.01), as was autophosphorylated CaMKII (<i>P</i><0.01), suggestive of constitutive activation. Calcineurin (<i>PPP3CB</i>) mRNA was not increased, nor was <i>RCAN1</i> mRNA level, indicating a lack of calcineurin activation. Furthermore, myocyte enhancer factor 2 and nuclear factor of activated T cell transcription factor activity was not increased in HCM, suggesting that calcineurin pathway activation is not an upstream cause of increased CAMKII protein abundance or activation. <i>SERCA2A</i> mRNA transcript levels were reduced in HCM regardless of genotype, as was sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase 2/phospholamban protein ratio (45% reduced; <i>P</i>=0.03). <sup>45</sup>Ca sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPaseuptake assay showed reduced uptake velocity in HCM regardless of genotype (<i>P</i>=0.01). The cardiac ryanodine receptor was not altered in transcript, protein, or phosphorylated (pS2808, pS2814) protein abundance, and [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding was not different in HCM, consistent with no major modification of the ryanodine receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Human HCM demonstrates calcium mishandling through both genotype-specific and common pathways. Posttranslational activation of the CaMKII pathway is specific to sarcomere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion–positive HCM, whereas sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase 2 abundance and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca uptake are depressed in both sarcomere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion–positive and –negative HCM.</p></sec>

Moving without a purpose: an experimental study of swarm guidance in the Western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>
<p>During reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong>ing, honey bee scouts perform two very important functions. Firstly, they find new nesting locations and return to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong> cluster to communicate their discoveries. Secondly, once the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong> is ready to depart, informed scout bees act as guides, leading the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong> to its final destination. We have previously hypothesised that the two processes, selecting a new nest site and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong> guidance, are tightly linked in honey bees. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong>s can be <i>laissez faire</i> about where they nest, reaching directional consensus prior to lift off seems unnecessary. If, in contrast, it is essential that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong> reaches a precise location, either directional consensus must be near unanimous prior to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong> departure or only a select subgroup of the scouts guide the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong>. Here, we tested experimentally whether directional consensus is necessary for the successful guidance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong>s of the Western honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i> by forcing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong>s into the air prior to the completion of the decision-making process. Our results show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong>s were unable to guide themselves prior to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong> reaching the pre-flight buzzing phase of the decision-making process, even when directional consensus was high. We therefore suggest that not all scouts involved in the decision-making process attempt to guide the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swarm</span></strong>.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator is different from the average plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator
<p>In metals, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al motions of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in magnetic fields, which is manifested by quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in electrical resistivity. This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here, we report a notable exception in an insulator—ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB<sub>12</sub>). The resistivity of YbB<sub>12</sub>, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in metals, exhibits distinct quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations. These unconventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations arise from the insulating bulk, even though the temperature dependence of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lation amplitude follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of metals with a large effective mass. Quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in the magnetic torque are also observed, albeit with a lighter effective mass.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion, varus-valgus angle, translations, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau.

From 100°, femoral external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion was observed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was observed from   140° when sitting cross-legged.

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>latory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and metabolism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion of the planet. Photosynthesis is a key metabolic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of photosynthesis, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from photosynthesis also feeds back to regulate the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by stabilizing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the stability of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator period are thought to adjust the timing of biological activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the dynamic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the dynamic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of biological events. Our data provide insight into how the dynamic period adjustment of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

KinG Is a Plant-Specific Kinesin That Regulates Both Intra- and Intercellular Movement of SHORT-ROOT
<p>Both endogenous plant proteins and viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> proteins associate with microtubules to promote their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> through plasmodesmata. The association of viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> proteins with microtubules facilitates the formation of virus-associated replication complexes, which are required for the amplification and subsequent spread of the virus. However, the role of microtubules in the intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> of plant proteins is less clear. Here we show that the SHORT-ROOT (SHR) protein, which moves between cells in the root to regulate root radial patterning, interacts with a type-14 kinesin, KINESIN G (KinG). KinG is a calponin homology domain kinesin that directly interacts with the SHR-binding protein SIEL (SHR-INTERACING EMBRYONIC LETHAL) and localizes to both microtubules and actin. Since SIEL and SHR associate with endosomes, we suggest that KinG serves as a linker between SIEL, SHR, and the plant cytoskeleton. Loss of KinG function results in a decrease in the intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> of SHR and an increase in the sensitivity of SHR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> to treatment with oryzalin. Examination of SHR and KinG localization and dynamics in live cells suggests that KinG is a nonmotile kinesin that promotes the pausing of SHR-associated endosomes. We suggest a model in which interaction of KinG with SHR allows for the formation of stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> complexes that facilitate the cell-to-cell transport of SHR.</p>

Cylindrical Inclusion Protein of Turnip Mosaic Virus Serves as a Docking Point for the Intercellular Movement of Viral Replication Vesicles
<p>Plant viruses move from the initially infected cell to adjacent cells through plasmodesmata (PDs). To do so, viruses encode dedicated protein(s) that facilitate this process. How viral proteins act together to support the intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> of viruses is poorly defined. Here, by using an infection-free intercellular vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> assay, we investigate the action of CI (cylindrical inclusion) and P3N-PIPO (amino-terminal half of P3 fused to Pretty Interesting Potyviridae open reading frame), the two PD-localized potyviral proteins encoded by <i>Turnip mosaic virus</i> (TuMV), in the intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> of the viral replication vesicles. We provide evidence that CI and P3N-PIPO are sufficient to support the PD targeting and intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> of TuMV replication vesicles induced by 6K2, a viral protein responsible for the generation of replication vesicles. 6K2 interacts with CI but not P3N-PIPO. When this interaction is impaired, the intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> of TuMV replication vesicles is inhibited. Furthermore, in transmission electron microscopy, vesicular structures are observed in connection with the cylindrical inclusion bodies at structurally modified PDs in cells coexpressing 6K2, CI, and P3N-PIPO. CI is directed to PDs through its interaction with P3N-PIPO. We hypothesize that CI serves as a docking point for PD targeting and the intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> of TuMV replication vesicles. This work contributes to a better understanding of the roles of different viral proteins in coordinating the intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> of viral replication vesicles.</p>

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

<p>Insects are among the most agile natural flyers. Hypotheses on their flight control cannot always be validated by experiments with animals or tethered robots. To this end, we developed a programmable and agile autonomous free-flying robot controlled through bio-inspired motion changes of its flapping wings. Despite being 55 times the size of a fruit fly, the robot can accurately mimic the rapid escape maneuvers of flies, including a correcting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yaw</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion toward the escape heading. Because the robot’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yaw</span></strong> control was turned off, we showed that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yaw</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ions result from passive, translation-induced aerodynamic coupling between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yaw</span></strong> torque and the roll and pitch torques produced throughout the maneuver. The robot enables new methods for studying animal flight, and its flight characteristics allow for real-world flight missions.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked lasers, microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin lasers. The recent advent of hybrid photonic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that this silicon-based Brillouin laser enters a regime of dynamics in which optical self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lation produces phonon linewidth narrowing. Our results provide a platform to develop a range of applications for monolithic integration within silicon photonic circuits.</p>

Calibrated mitotic oscillator drives motile ciliogenesis
<p>Cell division and differentiation depend on massive and rapid organelle remodeling. The mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator, centered on the cyclin-dependent kinase 1–anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (CDK1-APC/C) axis, spatiotemporally coordinates this reorganization in dividing cells. Here we discovered that nondividing cells could also implement this mitotic clocklike regulatory circuit to orchestrate subcellular reorganization associated with differentiation. We probed centriole amplification in differentiating mouse-brain multiciliated cells. These postmitotic progenitors fine-tuned mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator activity to drive the orderly progression of centriole production, maturation, and motile ciliation while avoiding the mitosis commitment threshold. Insufficient CDK1 activity hindered differentiation, whereas excessive activity accelerated differentiation yet drove postmitotic progenitors into mitosis. Thus, postmitotic cells can redeploy and ca<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">librat</span></strong>e the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator to uncouple cytoplasmic from nuclear dynamics for organelle remodeling associated with differentiation.</p>

Quantum control of molecular collisions at 1 kelvin
<p>Measurement of vector correlations in molecular scattering is an indispensable tool for mapping out interaction potentials. In a coexpanded supersonic beam, we have studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ionally inelastic process wherein deuterium hydride (HD) (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) collides with molecular deuterium (D<sub>2</sub>) to form HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 1), where <i>v</i> and <i>j</i> are the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ional and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional quantum numbers, respectively. HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) was prepared by Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage, with its bond axis aligned preferentially parallel or perpendicular to the lab-fixed relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veloc</span></strong>ity. The coexpansion brought the collision temperature down to 1 kelvin, restricting scattering to s and p partial waves. Scattering angular distributions showed a dramatic stereodynamic preference (~3:1) for perpendicular versus parallel alignment. The four-vector correlation measured between the initial and final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veloc</span></strong>ities and the initial and final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> vectors of HD provides insight into the strong anisotropic forces present in the collision process.</p>

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The magnetic fields of solar-type stars are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">turbul</span></strong>ent convective layers of stars and have a complex dependency upon stellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion rate. We have performed a set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">turbul</span></strong>ent global simulations that exhibit magnetic cycles varying systematically with stellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and luminosity. We find that the magnetic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">turbul</span></strong>ent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type stars.</p>

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices
<p>Cyclotron motion of charge carriers in metals and semiconductors leads to Landau quantization and magneto-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>latory behavior in their properties. Cryogenic temperatures are usually required to observe these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations. We show that graphene superlattices support a different type of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lation that does not rely on Landau quantization. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that charge carriers experience effectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Our work hints at unexplored physics in Hofstadter butterfly systems at high temperatures.</p>

Elucidation of the Mechanisms of Long-Distance mRNA Movement in a <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>/Tomato Heterograft System
<p>Recent heterograft analyses showed that large-scale messenger RNA (mRNA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> takes place in the phloem, but the number of mobile transcripts reported varies widely. However, our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying large-scale mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> remains limited. In this study, using a <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>/tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) heterograft system and a transgenic approach involving potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>), we found that: (1) the overall mRNA abundance in the leaf is not a good indicator of transcript mobility to the root; (2) increasing the expression levels of nonmobile mRNAs in the companion cells does not promote their mobility; (3) mobile mRNAs undergo degradation during their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong>; and (4) some mRNAs arriving in roots move back to shoots. These results indicate that mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> has both regulated and unregulated components. The cellular origins of mobile mRNAs may differ between herbaceous and woody species. Taken together, these findings suggest that the long-distance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> of mRNAs is a complex process and that elucidating the physiological roles associated with this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> is challenging but remains an important task for future research.</p>

Potato Mop-Top Virus Co-Opts the Stress Sensor HIPP26 for Long-Distance Movement
<p>Virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> proteins facilitate virus entry into the vascular system to initiate systemic infection. The potato mop-top virus (PMTV) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> protein, TGB1, is involved in long-distance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> of both viral ribonucleoprotein complexes and virions. Here, our analysis of TGB1 interactions with host <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> proteins revealed an interaction with a member of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heav</span></strong>y metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein family, HIPP26, which acts as a plasma membrane-to-nucleus signal during abiotic stress. We found that knockdown of <i>NbHIPP26</i> expression inhibited virus long-distance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> but did not affect cell-to-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong>. Drought and PMTV infection up-regulated <i>NbHIPP26</i> gene expression, and PMTV infection protected plants from drought. In addition, <i>NbHIPP26</i> promoter-reporter fusions revealed vascular tissue-specific expression. Mutational and biochemical analyses indicated that NbHIPP26 subcellular localization at the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata was mediated by lipidation (<i>S</i>-acylation and prenylation), as nonlipidated NbHIPP26 was predominantly in the nucleus. Notably, coexpression of NbHIPP26 with TGB1 resulted in a similar nuclear accumulation of NbHIPP26. TGB1 interacted with the carboxyl-terminal CVVM (prenyl) domain of NbHIPP26, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that the TGB1-HIPP26 complex localized to microtubules and accumulated in the nucleolus, with little signal at the plasma membrane or plasmodesmata. These data support a mechanism where interaction with TGB1 negates or reverses NbHIPP26 lipidation, thus releasing membrane-associated NbHIPP26 and redirecting it via microtubules to the nucleus, thereby activating the drought stress response and facilitating virus long-distance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong>.</p>

Circadian, Carbon, and Light Control of Expansion Growth and Leaf Movement
<p>We used Phytotyping<sup>4D</sup> to investigate the contribution of clock and light signaling to the diurnal regulation of rosette expansion growth and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Wild-type plants and clock mutants with a short (<i>lhycca1</i>) and long (<i>prr7prr9</i>) period were analyzed in a T24 cycle and in T-cycles that were closer to the mutants’ period. Wild types also were analyzed in various photoperiods and after transfer to free-running light or darkness. Rosette expansion and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> exhibited a circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lation, with superimposed transients after dawn and dusk. Diurnal responses were modified in clock mutants. <i>lhycca1</i> exhibited an inhibition of growth at the end of night and growth rose earlier after dawn, whereas <i>prr7prr9</i> showed decreased growth for the first part of the light period. Some features were partly rescued by a matching T-cycle, like the inhibition in <i>lhycca1</i> at the end of the night, indicating that it is due to premature exhaustion of starch. Other features were not rescued, revealing that the clock also regulates expansion growth more directly. Expansion growth was faster at night than in the daytime, whereas published work has shown that the synthesis of cellular components is faster in the day than at nighttime. This temporal uncoupling became larger in short photoperiods and may reflect the differing dependence of expansion and biosynthesis on energy, carbon, and water. While it has been proposed that leaf expansion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> are causally linked, we did not observe a consistent temporal relationship between expansion and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong>.</p>

A bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve
<p>The distributed network of receptors, neurons, and synapses in the somatosensory system efficiently processes complex tactile information. We used flexible organic electronics to mimic the functions of a sensory nerve. Our artificial afferent nerve collects pressure information (1 to 80 kilopascals) from clusters of pressure sensors, converts the pressure information into action potentials (0 to 100 hertz) by using ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators, and integrates the action potentials from multiple ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators with a synaptic transistor. Biomimetic hierarchical structures can detect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> of an object, combine simultaneous pressure inputs, and distinguish braille characters. Furthermore, we connected our artificial afferent nerve to motor nerves to construct a hybrid bioelectronic reflex arc to actuate muscles. Our system has potential applications in neurorobotics and neuroprosthetics.</p>

From local collective behavior to global migratory patterns in white storks
<p>Soaring migrant birds exploit columns of rising air (thermals) to cover large distances with minimal energy. Using social information while locating thermals may benefit such birds, but examining collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong>s in wild migrants has been a major challenge for researchers. We investigated the group <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong>s of a flock of 27 naturally migrating juvenile white storks by using high-resolution GPS and accelerometers. Analyzing individual and group <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong>s on multiple scales revealed that a small number of leaders navigated to and explored thermals, whereas followers benefited from their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong>s. Despite this benefit, followers often left thermals earlier and at lower height, and consequently they had to flap considerably more. Followers also migrated less far annually than did leaders. We provide insights into the interactions between freely flying social migrants and the costs and benefits of collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> in natural populations.</p>

Moving in the Anthropocene: Global reductions in terrestrial mammalian movements
<p>Animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> is fundamental for ecosystem functioning and species survival, yet the effects of the anthropogenic footprint on animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong>s have not been estimated across species. Using a unique GPS-tracking database of 803 individuals across 57 species, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong>s of mammals in areas with a comparatively high human footprint were on average one-half to one-third the extent of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong>s in areas with a low human footprint. We attribute this reduction to behavioral changes of individual animals and to the exclusion of species with long-range <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong>s from areas with higher human impact. Global loss of vagility alters a key ecological trait of animals that affects not only population persistence but also ecosystem processes such as predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and disease transmission.</p>

Revealing the subfemtosecond dynamics of orbital angular momentum in nanoplasmonic vortices
<p>The ability of light to carry and deliver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> (OAM) in the form of optical vortices has attracted much interest. The physical properties of light with a helical wavefront can be confined onto two-dimensional surfaces with subwavelength dimensions in the form of plasmonic vortices, opening avenues for thus far unknown light-matter interactions. Because of their extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veloc</span></strong>ity, the ultrafast dynamics of such vortices remained unexplored. Here we show the detailed spatiotemporal evolution of nanovortices using time-resolved two-photon photoemission electron microscopy. We observe both long- and short-range plasmonic vortices confined to deep subwavelength dimensions on the scale of 100 nanometers with nanometer spatial resolution and subfemtosecond time-step resolution. Finally, by measuring the angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veloc</span></strong>ity of the vortex, we directly extract the OAM magnitude of light.</p>

Medicago LINC Complexes Function in Nuclear Morphology, Nuclear Movement, and Root Nodule Symbiosis
<p>Nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> is involved in cellular and developmental processes across eukaryotic life, often driven by Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes, which bridge the nuclear envelope (NE) via the interaction of Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 Homology (KASH) and Sad1/UNC-84 (SUN) proteins. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) LINC complexes are involved in nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> and positioning in several cell types. Observations since the 1950s have described targeted nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> and positioning during symbiosis initiation between legumes and rhizobia, but it has not been established whether these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong>s are functional or incidental. Here, we identify and characterize LINC complexes in the model legume <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. We show that LINC complex characteristics such as NE localization, dependence of KASH proteins on SUN protein binding for NE enrichment, and direct SUN-KASH binding are conserved between plant species. Using a SUN dominant-negative strategy, we demonstrate that LINC complexes are necessary for proper nuclear shaping and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">movement</span></strong> in <i>Medicago</i> root hairs, and are important for infection thread initiation and nodulation.</p>

Synaptotagmin-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum-Plasma Membrane Contact Sites Are Localized to Immobile ER Tubules
<p>The plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is morphologically divided into tubules and sheets, seems to flow continuously as a whole, but locally, mobile and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e regions exist. In eukaryotes, the ER physically and functionally interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) at domains called ER-PM contact sites (EPCSs). Extended synaptotagmin family proteins are concentrated in the cortical ER to form one type of EPCS; however, it is unclear whether the localization of extended synaptotagmin corresponds to the EPCS and where in the cortical ER the EPCSs are formed. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal localization of SYNAPTOTAGMIN1 (SYT1), a synaptotagmin in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), to investigate the precise distribution of SYT1-associated EPCSs in the cortical ER. Three-dimensional imaging using superresolution confocal live imaging microscopy demonstrated that SYT1 was specifically localized to the ER-PM boundary. Time-lapse imaging revealed that SYT1 was distributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e ER tubules, but not to mobile tubules. Moreover, SYT1 was frequently localized to the edges of ER sheets that were transformed into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e ER tubules over time. A lower intracellular calcium ion concentration resulted in an increased EPCS area and disrupted the ER network. Finally, SYT1 deficiency caused a reduction of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e tubules and enlargement of the ER meshes. Taken together, our findings show that SYT1-associated EPCS are distributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e tubules and play an important role in the formation of the tubular ER network. This provides important insight into the relationship between the function and dynamics/morphology of the cortical ER.</p>

Twistable electronics with dynamically rotatable heterostructures
<p>In heterostructures of two-dimensional materials, electronic properties can vary dramatically with relative interlayer angle. This effect makes it theoretically possible to realize a new class of twistable electronics in which properties can be manipulated on demand by means of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion. We demonstrate a device architecture in which a layered heterostructure can be dynamically twisted in situ. We study graphene encapsulated by boron nitride, where, at small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion angles, the device characteristics are dominated by coupling to a long-wavelength moirééé superlattice. The ability to investigate arbitrary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion angle in a single device reveals features of the optical, mechanical, and electronic response in this system not captured in static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion studies. Our results establish the capability to fabricate twistable electronic devices with dynamically tunable properties.</p>

Two-channel model for ultralow thermal conductivity of crystalline Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>
<p>Solids with ultralow thermal conductivity are of great interest as thermal barrier coatings for insulation or thermoelectrics for energy conversion. However, the theoretical limits of lattice thermal conductivity (κ) are unclear. In typical crystals a phonon picture is valid, whereas lowest κ values occur in highly disordered materials where this picture fails and heat is supposedly carried by random walk among uncorrelated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators. Here we identify a simple crystal, Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>, with a calculated phonon κ [0.16 Watts per meter-Kelvin (W/m-K)] one-half that of our measured κ (0.30 W/m-K) at 300 K, approaching disorder κ values, although Raman spectra, specific heat, and temperature dependence of κ reveal typical phonon characteristics. Adding a transport component based on uncorrelated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators explains the measured κ and suggests that a two-channel model is necessary for crystals with ultralow κ.</p>

Enzyme-free nucleic acid dynamical systems
<p>Chemistries exhibiting complex dynamics—from inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators to gene regulatory networks—have been long known but either cannot be reprogrammed at will or rely on the sophisticated enzyme chemistry underlying the central dogma. Can simpler molecular mechanisms, designed from scratch, exhibit the same range of behaviors? Abstract chemical reaction networks have been proposed as a programming language for complex dynamics, along with their systematic implementation using short synthetic DNA molecules. We developed this technology for dynamical systems by identifying critical design principles and codifying them into a compiler automating the design process. Using this approach, we built an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator containing only DNA components, establishing that Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions alone suffice for complex chemical dynamics and that autonomous molecular systems can be designed via molecular programming languages.</p>

Arbitrary spin-to–orbital angular momentum conversion of light
<p>Optical elements that convert the spin angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> (SAM) of light into vortex beams have found applications in classical and quantum optics. These elements—SAM-to–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> (OAM) converters—are based on the geometric phase and only permit the conversion of left- and right-circular polarizations (spin states) into states with opposite OAM. We present a method for converting arbitrary SAM states into total angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> states characterized by a superposition of independent OAM. We designed a metasurface that converts left- and right-circular polarizations into states with independent values of OAM and designed another device that performs this operation for elliptically polarized states. These results illustrate a general material-mediated connection between SAM and OAM of light and may find applications in producing complex structured light and in optical communication.</p>

Chaos-assisted broadband momentum transformation in optical microresonators
<p>The law of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> conservation rules out many desired processes in optical microresonators. We report broadband <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> transformations of light in asymmetric whispering gallery microresonators. Assisted by chaotic motions, broadband light can travel between optical modes with different angular momenta within a few picoseconds. Efficient coupling from visible to near-infrared bands is demonstrated between a nanowaveguide and whispering gallery modes with quality factors exceeding 10 million. The broadband <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> transformation enhances the device conversion efficiency of the third-harmonic generation by greater than three orders of magnitude over the conventional evanescent-wave coupling. The observed broadband and fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> transformation could promote applications such as multicolor lasers, broadband memories, and multiwavelength optical networks.</p>

Rotary and linear molecular motors driven by pulses of a chemical fuel
<p>Many biomolecular motors catalyze the hydrolysis of chemical fuels, such as adenosine triphosphate, and use the energy released to direct motion through information ratchet mechanisms. Here we describe chemically-driven artificial rotary and linear molecular motors that operate through a fundamentally different type of mechanism. The directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion of [2]- and [3]catenane rotary molecular motors and the transport of substrates away from equilibrium by a linear molecular pump are induced by acid-base <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations. The changes simultaneously switch the binding site affinities and the labilities of barriers on the track, creating an energy ratchet. The linear and rotary molecular motors are driven by aliquots of a chemical fuel, trichloroacetic acid. A single fuel pulse generates 360° unidirectional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion of up to 87% of crown ethers in a [2]catenane rotary motor.</p>

The intestinal microbiota regulates body composition through NFIL<bold>3</bold> and the circadian clock
<p>The intestinal microbiota has been identified as an environmental factor that markedly affects energy storage and body-fat accumulation in mammals, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that the microbiota regulates body composition through the circadian transcription factor NFIL3. <i>Nfil3</i> transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lates diurnally in intestinal epithelial cells, and the amplitude of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lation is controlled by the microbiota through group 3 innate lymphoid cells, STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and the epithelial cell circadian clock. NFIL3 controls expression of a circadian lipid metabolic program and regulates lipid absorption and export in intestinal epithelial cells. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how the intestinal microbiota regulates body composition and establish NFIL3 as an essential molecular link among the microbiota, the circadian clock, and host metabolism.</p>

Tuning quantum nonlocal effects in graphene plasmonics
<p>The response of electron systems to electrodynamic fields that change rapidly in space is endowed by unique features, including an exquisite spatial nonlocality. This can reveal much about the materials’ electronic structure that is invisible in standard probes that use gradually varying fields. Here, we use graphene plasmons, propagating at extremely slow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veloc</span></strong>ities close to the electron Fermi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veloc</span></strong>ity, to probe the nonlocal response of the graphene electron liquid. The near-field imaging experiments reveal a parameter-free match with the full quantum description of the massless Dirac electron gas, which involves three types of nonlocal quantum effects: single-particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veloc</span></strong>ity matching, interaction-enhanced Fermi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veloc</span></strong>ity, and interaction-reduced compressibility. Our experimental approach can determine the full spatiotemporal response of an electron system.</p>

Bloch oscillations in the absence of a lattice
<p>The interplay of strong quantum correlations and far-from-equilibrium conditions can give rise to striking dynamical phenomena. We experimentally investigated the quantum motion of an impurity atom immersed in a strongly interacting one-dimensional Bose liquid and subject to an external force. We found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> distribution of the impurity exhibits characteristic Bragg reflections at the edge of an emergent Brillouin zone. Although Bragg reflections are typically associated with lattice structures, in our strongly correlated quantum liquid they result from the interplay of short-range crystalline order and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ic constraints on the many-body scattering processes in the one-dimensional system. As a consequence, the impurity exhibits periodic dynamics, reminiscent of Bloch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations, although the quantum liquid is translationally invariant. Our observations are supported by large-scale numerical simulations.</p>

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within communities can interact to organize their behavior. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the behavior of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm communities undergoing metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations can become coupled through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. Coupling increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their behavior to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

Lipid transport by TMEM24 at ER–plasma membrane contacts regulates pulsatile insulin secretion
<p>Insulin is released by β cells in pulses regulated by calcium and phosphoinositide signaling. Here, we describe how transmembrane protein 24 (TMEM24) helps coordinate these signaling events. We showed that TMEM24 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–anchored membrane protein whose reversible localization to ER-plasma membrane (PM) contacts is governed by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in cytosolic calcium. A lipid-binding module in TMEM24 transports the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] precursor phosphatidylinositol between bilayers, allowing replenishment of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolyzed during signaling. In the absence of TMEM24, calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations are abolished, leading to a defect in triggered insulin release. Our findings implicate direct lipid transport between the ER and the PM in the control of insulin secretion, a process impaired in patients with type II diabetes.</p>

Imaging rotational dynamics of nanoparticles in liquid by 4D electron microscopy
<p>In real time and space, four-dimensional electron microscopy (4D EM) has enabled observation of transient structures and morphologies of inorganic and organic materials. We have extended 4D EM to include liquid cells without the time resolution being limited by the response of the detector. Our approach permits the imaging of the motion and morphological dynamics of a single, same particle on nanometer and ultrashort time scales. As a first application, we studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional dynamics of gold nanoparticles in aqueous solution. A full transition from the conventional diffusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion to superdiffusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and further to a ballistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion was observed with increasing asymmetry of the nanoparticle morphology.

High-resolution lithosphere viscosity and dynamics revealed by magnetotelluric imaging
<p>An accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">viscos</span></strong>ity structure is critical to truthfully modeling lithosphere dynamics. Here, we report an attempt to infer the effective lithospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">viscos</span></strong>ity from a high-resolution magnetotelluric (MT) survey across the western United States. The high sensitivity of MT fields to the presence of electrically conductive fluids makes it a promising proxy for determining mechanical strength variations throughout the lithosphere. We demonstrate how a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">viscos</span></strong>ity structure, approximated from electrical resistivity, results in a geodynamic model that successfully predicts short-wavelength surface topography, lithospheric deformation, and mantle upwelling beneath recent volcanism. We further show that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">viscos</span></strong>ity is physically consistent with and better constrained than that derived from laboratory-based rheology. We conclude that MT imaging provides a practical observational constraint for quantifying the dynamic evolution of the continental lithosphere.</p>

The Coumarin Glucoside, Esculin, Reveals Rapid Changes in Phloem-Transport Velocity in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>The study of phloem transport and its vital roles in long-distance communication and carbon allocation have been hampered by a lack of suitable tools that allow high-throughput, real-time studies. Esculin, a fluorescent coumarin glucoside, is recognized by Suc transporters, including AtSUC2, which loads it into the phloem for translocation to sink tissues. These properties make it an ideal tool for use in live-imaging experiments, where it acts as a surrogate for Suc. Here, we show that esculin is translocated with a similar efficiency to Suc and, because of its ease of application and detection, demonstrate that it is an ideal tool for in vivo studies of phloem transport. We used esculin to determine the effect of different environmental cues on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veloc</span></strong>ity of phloem transport. We provide evidence that fluctuations in cotyledon Suc levels influence phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veloc</span></strong>ity rapidly, supporting the pressure-flow model of phloem transport. Under acute changes in light levels, the phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veloc</span></strong>ity mirrored changes in the expression of <i>AtSUC2</i>. This observation suggests that under certain environmental conditions, transcriptional regulation may affect the abundance of AtSUC2 and thus regulate the phloem transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veloc</span></strong>ity.</p>

Scopoletin 8-Hydroxylase-Mediated Fraxetin Production Is Crucial for Iron Mobilization
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral nutrient and an important factor for the composition of natural plant communities. Low Fe availability in aerated soils with neutral or alkaline pH has led to the evolution of elaborate mechanisms that extract Fe from the soil solution. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), Fe is acquired by an orchestrated strategy that comprises mobilization, chelation, and reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> prior to its uptake. Here, we show that At3g12900, previously annotated as scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H), participates in Fe acquisition by mediating the biosynthesis of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin), a coumarin derived from the scopoletin pathway. S8H is highly induced in roots of Fe-deficient plants both at the transcript and protein levels. Mutants defective in the expression of <i>S8H</i> showed increased sensitivity to growth on pH 7.0 media supplemented with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e source of Fe and reduced secretion of fraxetin. Transgenic lines overexpressing <i>S8H</i> exhibited an opposite phenotype. Homozygous <i>s8h</i> mutants grown on media with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>ized Fe accumulated significantly more scopolin, the storage form of scopoletin, supporting the designated function of S8H in scopoletin hydroxylation. Fraxetin exhibited Fe-reducing properties in vitro with higher rates being observed at neutral relative to acidic pH. Supplementing the media containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>e Fe with fraxetin partially rescued the <i>s8h</i> mutants. In natural Arabidopsis accessions differing in their performance on media containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immobil</span></strong>ized Fe, the amount of secreted fraxetin was highly correlated with growth and Fe and chlorophyll content, indicating that fraxetin secretion is a decisive factor for calcicole-calcifuge behavior (i.e. the ability/inability to thrive on alkaline soils) of plants.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>es the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ions translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

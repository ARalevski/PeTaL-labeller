Outcomes after extensive manual curettage and limited burring for atypical cartilaginous tumour of long bone
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Adjuvant treatment after intralesional curettage for atypical   cartilaginous tumours (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s) of long bones is widely accepted for   extending surgical margins. However, evaluating the isolated effect   of adjuvant treatment is difficult, and it is unclear whether not   using such adjuvants provides poor oncological outcomes. Hence,   we analyzed whether intralesional curettage without cryosurgery   or chemical adjuvants provides poor oncological outcomes in patients   with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 24 patients (nine men, 15 women) (mean age 45 years;   18 to 62) were treated for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s of long bones and followed up for   a median of 66 months (interquartile range 50 to 84).

Nuclear Prohibitin3 Maintains Genome Integrity and Cell Proliferation in the Root Meristem through Minichromosome Maintenance 2
<p>The nucleo-mitochondrial dual-localized proteins can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as gene expression regulators; however, few instances of these proteins have been described in plants. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROHIBITIN 3 (PHB3) is involved in stress responses and developmental processes, but it is unknown how these roles are achieved at the molecular level in the nucleus. In this study, we show that nucleo-mitochondrial PHB3 plays an essential role in regulating genome stability and cell proliferation. <i>PHB3</i> is up-regulated by DNA damage agents, and the stress-induced PHB3 proteins accumulate in the nucleus. Loss of function of <i>PHB3</i> results in DNA damage and defective maintenance of the root stem cell niche. Subsequently, the expression patterns and levels of the root stem cell regulators are altered and down-regulated, respectively. In addition, the <i>phb3</i> mutant shows aberrant cell division and altered expression of cell cycle–related genes, such as <i>CycB1</i> and <i>Cyclin dependent kinase 1</i>. Moreover, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) genes, e.g. <i>MCM2</i>, <i>MCM3</i>, <i>MCM4</i>, <i>MCM5</i>, <i>MCM6</i>, and <i>MCM7</i>, are up-regulated in the <i>phb3</i> mutant. Reducing the <i>MCM2</i> expression level substantially recovers the DNA damage in the <i>phb3</i> mutant and partially rescues the altered cell proliferation and root deficiency of <i>phb3</i> seedlings. PHB3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as a transcriptional coregulator that represses <i>MCM2</i> expression by competitively binding to the promoter E2F–cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing elements with E2Fa so as to modulate primary root growth. Collectively, these findings indicate that nuclear-localized PHB3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as a transcriptional coregulator that suppresses <i>MCM2</i> expression to sustain genome integrity and cell proliferation for stem cell niche maintenance in Arabidopsis.</p>

Revolutionary malaria tests have unexpected downsides
<p>A cheap, simple test has transformed the treatment of malaria, a major childhood killer in poor countries. With a single drop of blood taken from a finger prick, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can diagnose malaria accurately and almost instantly, and the test is so easy to use that volunteers from local communities in remote villages across Africa and Asia now commonly deploy it. Until RDTs became widespread, almost all fevers were treated as if they were malaria, leading to the overuse of the new generation of "wonder drugs," artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which were in danger of being lost to drug resistance. Now, with accurate diagnosis, ACTs can be targeted to those who need them, and the hope has been that patients who don’t have malaria would be treated for the true cause of their fever. But now a huge new study suggests that, along its enormous benefits, the rollout of RDTs has had some unintended—and undesirable—consequences: overprescription of antibiotics, which can exacerbate the rapid rise in antibiotic-resistant infections. What’s more, some patients who did not have malaria were given ACTs anyway, and more troubling, some with malaria were not, leaving them at risk of severe disease or death.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant systemic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two systemic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we char<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>erized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Comp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s systemically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ions of the CRA2 systemic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor systemic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN systemic pathways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

Extracellular ATP Shapes a Defense-Related Transcriptome Both Independently and along with Other Defense Signaling Pathways
<p>ATP is not only an essential metabolite of cellular biochemistry but also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as a signal in the extracellular milieu. In plants, extracellular ATP is monitored by the purinergic receptor P2K1. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as a damage-associated molecular pattern in plants, and its signaling through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various pathogenic microorganisms. Biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens attack plants using different strategies, to which plants respond accordingly with salicylate-based or jasmonate/ethylene-based defensive signaling, respectively. Interestingly, defense mediated by P2K1 is effective against pathogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular ATP signaling and that of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. To address this issue, we analyzed ATP-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the signaling pathways of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate (classic defense hormones) as well as a mutant and an overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor. We found that P2K1 function is crucial for faithful ATP-induced transcriptional changes and that a subset of genes is more responsive in the P2K1 overexpression line. We also found that more than half of the ATP-responsive genes required signaling by one or more of the pathways for the classical defense hormones, with the jasmonate-based signaling being more critical than others. By contrast, the other ATP-responsive genes were unaffected by deficiencies in signaling for any of the classical defense hormones. These ATP-responsive genes were highly enriched for defense-related Gene Ontology terms. We further tested the ATP-induced genes in knockout mutants of transcription f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ors, demonstrating that MYCs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing downstream of the jasmonate receptor complex and calmodulin-binding transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivators are nuclear transducers of P2K1-mediated extracellular ATP signaling.</p>

The RopGEF2-ROP7/ROP2 Pathway Activated by phyB Suppresses Red Light-Induced Stomatal Opening<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Circadian rhythm of stomatal aperture is mainly regulated by light/darkness. Blue and red light induce stomatal opening through different mechanisms that are mediated by special receptors. ROP2, a member of Rho GTPase family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>), has been found to negatively regulate light-induced stomatal opening. However, the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>or (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ion of RopGEFs-ROPs. Here, we showed that RopGEF2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ed as a negative regulator in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated red light-induced stomatal opening. Meanwhile, ROP7, another member of ROP family, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing redundantly with ROP2, was regulated by RopGEF2 in this process. RopGEF2 inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ed with ROP7 and ROP2 and enhanced their intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates. Furthermore, the direct inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ions between phyB and RopGEF2 were detected in vitro and in plants, and phyB enhanced the GEF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity of RopGEF2 toward both ROP7 and ROP2 under light. In addition, RopGEF4 functioned redundantly with RopGEF2 in red light-induced stomatal opening by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivating both ROP7 and ROP2, and <i>RopGEF2</i>/<i>RopGEF4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ed genetically downstream of <i>phyB</i>; however, the GEF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity of RopGEF4 was not directly enhanced by phyB. These results revealed that red light-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivated phyB enhances the GEF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivities of RopGEF2 and RopGEF4 directly or indirectly, and then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivate both ROP7 and ROP2 in guard cells. The negative mechanism triggered by phyB prevents the excessive stomatal opening under red light.</p>

Heterochronic Meiotic Misexpression in an Interspecific Yeast Hybrid
<p>Regulatory changes rapidly accumulate between species, and interspecific hybrids often misexpress genes. Hybrid misexpression, expression levels outside the range of both parental species, can result from <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing regulatory changes that inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> abnormally in hybrids. Thus, misexpressed genes may contribute to hybrid sterility. However, in the context of a whole organism, misexpression may not result directly from <i>cis–trans</i> inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ions but rather indirectly from differences between hybrid and parental abundance of cell types. Here we eliminate the confounding effects of cell types by examining gene expression in a sterile interspecific yeast hybrid during meiosis. We investigated gene expression of the yeasts <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>S. paradoxus</i>, and their hybrid at multiple meiotic stages. Although the hybrid and parents exhibit similar changes in expression levels across meiosis, the hybrid meiotic program occurs earlier than either parent. The timing change produces a heterochronic pattern of misexpression during midmeiosis. Coincident with the timing of misexpression, we find a transition from predominantly <i>trans</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing to <i>cis-</i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing expression divergence and an increase in the number of opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes. However, we find no direct relationship between opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes and misexpression. Contrary to the notion that <i>cis–trans</i> inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ions cause misexpression, a heterochronic shift in the normal meiotic gene expression program produces patterns of misexpression in an yeast hybrid. Our results imply that temporal dynamics of single cell types is important to understanding hybrid misexpression and its relationship to <i>cis–trans</i> inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ions.</p>

Late-phase synthesis of IκBα insulates the TLR4-activated canonical NF-κB pathway from noncanonical NF-κB signaling in macrophages
<p>The nuclear f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>or κB (NF-κB) transcription f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ors coordinate the inflammatory immune response during microbial infection. Pathogenic substances engage canonical NF-κB signaling through the heterodimer RelA:p50, which is subjected to rapid negative feedback by inhibitor of κBα (IκBα). The noncanonical NF-κB pathway is required for the differentiation of immune cells; however, cross-talk between both pathways can occur. Concomitantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivated noncanonical signaling generates p52 from the p100 precursor. The synthesis of p100 is induced by canonical signaling, leading to the formation of the late-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing RelA:p52 heterodimer. This cross-talk prolongs inflammatory RelA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity in epithelial cells to ensure pathogen clearance. We found that the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivated canonical NF-κB signaling pathway is insulated from lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR)–induced noncanonical signaling in mouse macrophage cell lines. Combined computational and biochemical studies indicated that the extent of NF-κB–responsive expression of <i>Nfkbia</i>, which encodes IκBα, inversely correlated with cross-talk. The <i>Nfkbia</i> promoter showed enhanced responsiveness to NF-κB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivation in macrophages compared to that in fibroblasts. We found that this hyperresponsive promoter engaged the RelA:p52 dimer generated during costimulation of macrophages through TLR4 and LTβR to trigger synthesis of IκBα at late time points, which prevented the late-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing RelA cross-talk response. Together, these data suggest that, despite the presence of identical signaling networks in cells of diverse lineages, emergent cross-talk between signaling pathways is subject to cell type–specific regulation. We propose that the insulation of canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways limits the deleterious effects of macrophage-mediated inflammation.</p>

The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR promotes lung adenocarcinoma migration and invasion by stabilizing <i>FAK</i>
<p>Large-scale, genome-wide studies report that RNA binding proteins are altered in cancers, but it is unclear how these proteins control tumor progression. We found that the RNA-editing protein ADAR (adenosine deaminase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing on double-stranded RNA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ed as a facilitator of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) progression through its ability to stabilize transcripts encoding focal adhesion kinase (FAK). In samples from 802 stage I LUAD patients, increased abundance of ADAR at both the mRNA and protein level correlated with tumor recurrence. Knocking down ADAR in LUAD cells suppressed their mesenchymal properties, migration, and invasion in culture. Analysis of gene expression patterns in LUAD cells identified ADAR-associated enrichment of a subset of genes involved in cell migration pathways; among these, <i>FAK</i> is the most notable gene whose expression was increased in the presence of ADAR. Molecular analyses revealed that ADAR posttranscriptionally increased FAK protein abundance by binding to the <i>FAK</i> transcript and editing a specific intronic site that resulted in the increased stabilization of <i>FAK</i> mRNA. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK blocked ADAR-induced invasiveness of LUAD cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic application for LUAD that has a high abundance of ADAR.</p>

The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 promotes T cell adhesion by activating the adaptor protein CrkII in the immunological synapse
<p>The adaptor protein CrkII regulates T cell adhesion by recruiting the guanine nucleotide exchange f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>or C3G, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivator of Rap1. Subsequently, Rap1 stimulates the integrin LFA-1, which leads to T cell adhesion and inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ion with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The adhesion of T cells to APCs is critical for their proper function and education. The interface between the T cell and the APC is known as the immunological synapse. It is char<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>erized by the specific organization of proteins that can be divided into central supramolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivation clusters (c-SMACs) and peripheral SMACs (p-SMACs). Through total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and experiments with supported lipid bilayers, we determined that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivated Rap1 was recruited to the immunological synapse and localized to the p-SMAC. C3G and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ive (dephosphorylated) form of CrkII also localized to the same compartment. In contrast, in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ive (phosphorylated) CrkII was confined to the c-SMAC. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivation of CrkII and its subsequent movement from the c-SMAC to the p-SMAC depended on the phosphatase SHP-1, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ed downstream of the T cell receptor. In the p-SMAC, CrkII recruited C3G, which led to Rap1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivation and LFA-1–mediated adhesion of T cells to APCs. Functionally, SHP-1 was necessary for both the adhesion and migration of T cells. Together, these data highlight a signaling pathway in which SHP-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s through CrkII to reshape the pattern of Rap1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivation in the immunological synapse.</p>

Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells amplify allergic asthma responses
<p>Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are rare airway epithelial cells whose function is poorly understood. Here we show that <i>Ascl1</i>-mutant mice that have no PNECs exhibit severely blunted mucosal type 2 response in models of allergic asthma. PNECs reside in close proximity to group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) near airway branch points. PNECs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> through calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) to stimulate ILC2s and elicit downstream immune responses. In addition, PNECs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> through the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to induce goblet cell hyperplasia.

Giant nonlinear response at a plasmonic nanofocus drives efficient four-wave mixing
<p>Efficient optical frequency mixing typically must accumulate over large inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ion lengths because nonlinear responses in natural materials are inherently weak. This limits the efficiency of mixing processes owing to the requirement of phase matching. Here, we report efficient four-wave mixing (FWM) over micrometer-scale inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ion lengths at telecommunications wavelengths on silicon. We used an integrated plasmonic gap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">waveguid</span></strong>e that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer. The gap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">waveguid</span></strong>e intensifies light by nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometers, thus generating a nonlinear response so strong that efficient FWM accumulates over wavelength-scale distances.

A MYB Triad Controls Primary and Phenylpropanoid Metabolites for Pollen Coat Patterning
<p>The pollen wall is a complex, durable structure essential for plant reproduction. A substantial portion of phenylpropanoids (e.g. flavonols) produced by pollen grain tapetal cells are deposited in the pollen wall. Transcriptional regulation of pollen wall formation has been studied extensively, and a specific regulatory mechanism for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) pollen flavonol biosynthesis has been postulated. Here, metabolome and transcriptome analyses of anthers from mutant and overexpression genotypes revealed that Arabidopsis MYB99, a putative ortholog of the petunia (<i>Petunia hybrida</i>) floral scent regulator ODORANT1 (ODO1), controls the exclusive production of tapetum diglycosylated flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid amides. We discovered that MYB99 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s in a regulatory triad with MYB21 and MYB24, orthologs of emission of benzenoids I and II, which together with ODO1 coregulate petunia scent biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, promoter-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivation assays showed that MYB99 directs precursor supply from the Calvin cycle and oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway in primary metabolism to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis by controlling <i>TRANSKETOLASE2</i> expression. We provide a model depicting the relationship between the Arabidopsis MYB triad and structural genes from primary and phenylpropanoid metabolism and compare this mechanism with petunia scent control. The discovery of orthologous protein triads producing related secondary metabolites suggests that analogous regulatory modules exist in other plants and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> to regulate various branches of the intricate phenylpropanoid pathway.</p>

The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase RHA2b Promotes Degradation of MYB30 in Abscisic Acid Signaling
<p>The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical for plants encountering abiotic stress. We reported previously that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transcription f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>or MYB30 participates in ABA responses via SUMO ligase SAP-MIZ Domain-Containing SIZ1-mediated sumoylation. Here, we show that the RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase RHA2b, which positively regulates ABA signaling, inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ed with and ubiquitinated MYB30 to modulate MYB30 stability through the 26S proteasome pathway. The degradation rate of MYB30 was repressed significantly in the <i>rha2b-1</i> mutant. Phenotypic analyses showed that <i>MYB30</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s genetically downstream of <i>RHA2b</i> in ABA signaling. Substitutions of lysine-283 (K283) and K165 blocked ubiquitination, suggesting that these residues are sites of ubiquitination. K283 residue substitution significantly inhibited the degradation of MYB30 induced by ABA. The K165 site functioned additively with K283 in ABA-induced MYB30 degradation and ABA responses. At the same time, sumoylation protected MYB30 from degradation under cycloheximide and ABA treatment. Compared with MYB30, overexpression of MYB30-SUMO1 partially recovered the ABA sensitivity of <i>siz1-2</i>. But MYB30-SUMO1 exhibited similar localization with MYB30 in nuclei. Overall, our results suggest that RHA2b targets MYB30 for degradation to modulate ABA signaling. Considering that the K283 residue also is the major site for sumoylation, we propose that sumoylation and ubiquitination <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> antagonistically in the ABA response to regulate the stability of MYB30 by occupying the same residue.</p>

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian oscillator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing as a brake. Changes in circadian oscillator period are thought to adjust the timing of biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian oscillator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the dynamic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the dynamic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of biological events. Our data provide insight into how the dynamic period adjustment of circadian oscillators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

Screening for Biologically Annotated Drugs That Trigger Triacylglycerol Accumulation in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i>
<p>Microalgae are a promising feedstock for the production of triacylglycerol (TAG) for a variety of potential applications, ranging from food and human health to biofuels and green chemistry. However, obtaining high TAG yields is challenging. A phenotypic assay for the accumulation of oil droplets was developed to screen a library of 1,200 drugs, annotated with pharmacology information, to select compounds that trigger TAG accumulation in the diatom <i>Phaeod<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ylum tricornutum</i>. Using this screen, we identified 34 molecules <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing in a dose-dependent manner. Previously char<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>erized targets of these compounds include cell division and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five compounds possibly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen that is used in contraceptive pills and known for its ecological imp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as an endocrine disruptor. Ethynylestradiol impaired the production of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, destabilized the gal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>olipid versus phospholipid balance, and triggered the recycling of fatty acids from membrane lipids to TAG. The <i>P. tricornutum</i> transcriptomic response to treatment with ethynylestradiol was consistent with the reallocation of carbon from sterols to acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ion and catabolism of ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regulated cytochrome P450 proteins. A fatty acid elongase, Δ6-ELO-B1, might be involved in the impairment of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid turnover. This phenotypic screen opens new perspectives for the exploration of novel bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ive molecules, potential target genes, and pathways controlling TAG biosynthesis. It also unraveled the sensitivity of diatoms to endocrine disruptors, highlighting an imp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> of anthropogenic pollution on phytoplankton.</p>

Cytokinin Targets Auxin Transport to Promote Shoot Branching
<p>Cytokinin promotes shoot branching by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivating axillary buds, but its mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in this process is unclear. We have shown previously that a hextuple mutant lacking a clade of type-A Arabidopsis Response Regulators (ARRs) known to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> in cytokinin signaling has reduced shoot branching compared with the wild type. Since these proteins typically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as negative regulators of cytokinin signaling, this is an unexpected result. To explore this paradox more deeply, we char<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>erized the effects of loss of function of the type-B ARR, ARR1, which positively regulates cytokinin-induced gene expression. The <i>arr1</i> mutant has increased branching, consistent with a role antagonistic to the type-A ARRs but in apparent conflict with the known positive role for cytokinin in bud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivation. We show that the <i>arr</i> branching phenotypes correlate with increases in stem auxin transport and steady-state levels of the auxin export proteins PIN3 and PIN7 on the plasma membrane of xylem-associated cells in the main stem. Cytokinin treatment results in an increased accumulation of PIN3, PIN7, and the closely related PIN4 within several hours, and loss of <i>PIN3</i>, <i>PIN4</i>, and <i>PIN7</i> can partially rescue the <i>arr1</i> branching phenotype. This suggests that there are multiple signaling pathways for cytokinin in bud outgrowth; one of these pathways regulates PIN proteins in shoots, independently of the canonical signaling function of the <i>ARR</i> genes tested here. A hypothesis consistent with the <i>arr</i> shoot phenotypes is that feedback control of biosynthesis leads to altered cytokinin accumulation, driving cytokinin signaling via this pathway.</p>

Auxin Contributes to the Intraorgan Regulation of Gene Expression in Response to Shade
<p>Plants sense and respond to light via multiple photoreceptors including phytochrome. The decreased ratio of red to far-red light that occurs under a canopy triggers shade-avoidance responses, which allow plants to compete with neighboring plants. The leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as a photoperceptive organ in this response. In this study, we investigated how the shade stimulus is spatially processed within the cotyledon. We performed transcriptome analysis on microtissue samples collected from vascular and nonvascular regions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. In addition, we mechanically isolated and analyzed the vascular tissue. More genes were up-regulated by the shade stimulus in vascular tissues than in mesophyll and epidermal tissues. The genes up-regulated in the vasculature were functionally divergent and included many auxin-responsive genes, suggesting that various physiological/developmental processes might be controlled by shade stimulus in the vasculature. We then investigated the spatial regulation of these genes in the vascular tissues. A small vascular region within a cotyledon was irradiated with far-red light, and the response was compared with that when the whole seedling was irradiated with far-red light. Most of the auxin-responsive genes were not fully induced by the local irradiation, suggesting that perception of the shade stimulus requires that a wider area be exposed to far-red light or that a certain position in the mesophyll and epidermis of the cotyledon be irradiated. This result was consistent with a previous report that auxin synthesis genes are up-regulated in the periphery of the cotyledon. Hence, auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as an important intraorgan signaling f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>or that controls the vascular shade response within the cotyledon.</p>

ALY RNA-Binding Proteins Are Required for Nucleocytosolic mRNA Transport and Modulate Plant Growth and Development
<p>The regulated transport of mRNAs from the cell nucleus to the cytosol is a critical step linking transcript synthesis and processing with translation. However, in plants, only a few of the f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ors that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> in the mRNA export pathway have been functionally char<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>erized. Flowering plant genomes encode several members of the ALY protein family, which function as mRNA export f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ors in other organisms. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ALY1 to ALY4 are commonly detected in root and leaf cells, but they are differentially expressed in reproductive tissue. Moreover, the subnuclear distribution of ALY1/2 differs from that of ALY3/4. ALY1 binds with higher affinity to single-stranded RNA than double-stranded RNA and single-stranded DNA and inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s preferentially with 5-methylcytosine-modified single-stranded RNA. Compared with the full-length protein, the individual RNA recognition motif of ALY1 binds RNA only weakly. ALY proteins inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> with the RNA helicase UAP56, indicating a link to the mRNA export machinery. Consistently, ALY1 complements the lethal phenotype of yeast cells lacking the ALY1 ortholog Yra1. Whereas individual <i>aly</i> mutants have a wild-type appearance, disruption of <i>ALY1</i> to <i>ALY4</i> in <i>4xaly</i> plants causes vegetative and reproductive defects, including strongly reduced growth, altered flower morphology, as well as abnormal ovules and female gametophytes, causing reduced seed production. Moreover, polyadenylated mRNAs accumulate in the nuclei of <i>4xaly</i> cells. Our results highlight the requirement of efficient mRNA nucleocytosolic transport for proper plant growth and development and indicate that ALY1 to ALY4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> partly redundantly in this process; however, differences in expression and subnuclear localization suggest distinct functions.</p>

Multiplex Fluorescent, Activity-Based Protein Profiling Identifies Active α-Glycosidases and Other Hydrolases in Plants
<p>With nearly 140 α-glycosidases in 14 different families, plants are well equipped with enzymes that can break the α-glucosidic bonds in a large diversity of molecules. Here, we introduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity-based protein profiling (ABPP) of α-glycosidases in plants using α-configured cyclophellitol aziridine probes carrying various fluorophores or biotin. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), these probes label members of the GH31 family of glycosyl hydrolases, including endoplasmic reticulum-resident α-glucosidase-II Radial Swelling3/Priority for Sweet Life5 (RSW3/PSL5) and Golgi-resident α-mannosidase-II Hybrid Glycosylation1 (HGL1), both of which trim <i>N</i>-glycans on glycoproteins. We detected the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ive state of extracellular α-glycosidases such as α-xylosidase XYL1, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s on xyloglucans in the cell wall to promote cell expansion, and α-glucosidase AGLU1, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s in starch hydrolysis and can suppress fungal invasion. Labeling of α-glycosidases generates pH-dependent signals that can be suppressed by α-glycosidase inhibitors in a broad range of plant species. To demonstrate its use on a nonmodel plant species, we applied ABPP on saffron crocus (<i>Crocus sativus</i>), a cash crop for the production of saffron spice. Using a combination of biotinylated glycosidase probes, we identified and quantified 67 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ive glycosidases in saffron crocus stigma, of which 10 are differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ive. We also uncovered massive changes in hydrolase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivities in the corms upon infection with <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> using multiplex fluorescence labeling in combination with probes for serine hydrolases and cysteine proteases. These experiments demonstrate the ease with which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ive α-glycosidases and other hydrolases can be analyzed through ABPP in model and nonmodel plants.</p>

Dynamics of Ethylene Production in Response to Compatible Nod Factor
<p>Establishment of symbiotic nitrogen-fixation in legumes is regulated by the plant hormone ethylene, but it has remained unclear whether and how its biosynthesis is regulated by the symbiotic pathway. We established a sensitive ethylene detection system for <i>Lotus japonicus</i> and found that ethylene production increased as early as 6 hours after inoculation with <i>Mesorhizobium loti</i>. This ethylene response was dependent on Nod f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>or production by compatible rhizobia. Analyses of nodulation mutants showed that perception of Nod f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>or was required for ethylene emission, while downstream transcription f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ors including CYCLOPS, NIN, and ERN1 were not required for this response. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivation of the nodulation signaling pathway in spontaneously nodulating mutants was also sufficient to elevate ethylene production. Ethylene signaling is controlled by EIN2, which is duplicated in <i>L. japonicus</i>. We obtained a <i>L. japonicus Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant that exhibits complete ethylene insensitivity and confirms that these two genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> redundantly in ethylene signaling. Consistent with this redundancy, both <i>LjEin2a</i> and <i>LjEin2b</i> are required for negative regulation of nodulation and <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutants are hypernodulating and hyperinfected. We also identified an unexpected role for ethylene in the onset of nitrogen fixation, with the <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant showing severely reduced nitrogen fixation.

Pollen Aperture Factor INP1 Acts Late in Aperture Formation by Excluding Specific Membrane Domains from Exine Deposition
<p>Accurate placement of extracellular materials is a critical part of cellular development. To study how cells achieve this accuracy, we use formation of pollen apertures as a model.

In developing pollen, Arabidopsis <i>INAPERTURATE POLLEN1</i> (INP1) protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as a marker for the preaperture domains, assembling there into three punctate lines. To understand the mechanism of aperture formation, we studied the dynamics of INP1 expression and localization and its relationship with the membrane domains at which it assembles. We found that INP1 assembly occurs after meiotic cytokinesis at the interface between the plasma membrane and the overlying callose wall, and requires the normal callose wall formation. Sites of INP1 localization coincide with positions of protruding membrane ridges in proximity to the callose wall. Our data suggest that INP1 is a late-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>or involved in keeping specific membrane domains next to the callose wall to prevent formation of exine at these sites.</p>

The E3 Ligase TaSAP5 Alters Drought Stress Responses by Promoting the Degradation of DRIP Proteins
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants growing under normal conditions, DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) is present at low levels because it is ubiquitinated and destabilized by DREB2A INTER<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ING PROTEIN1 (DRIP1) and DRIP2 through 26S proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Drought stress counter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s the ubiquitination and proteolysis of DREB2A, thus allowing the accumulation of sufficient amounts of DREB2A protein to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivate downstream gene expression. The mechanisms leading to drought stress-mediated DREB2A accumulation are still unclear. Here, we report that the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) TaSAP5 protein, which contains an A20/AN1 domain, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate DRIP degradation and thus increase DREB2A protein levels.

TaSAP5 can inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> with and ubiquitinate TaDRIP, as well as AtDRIP1 and AtDRIP2, leading to their subsequent degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway. Consistent with this, <i>TaSAP5</i> overexpression enhances DRIP degradation and increases the levels of DREB2A protein and its downstream targets.

The imp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> of environmental NO needs to be addressed.

Here, using the <i>Phaeod<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ylum</i> Pt1 strain, 2E,4E-decadienal supplied in the micromolar concentration range led to a nonspecific cell toxicity. We reexamined NO biosynthesis and response in <i>Phaeod<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ylum</i>. NO inhibits cell growth and triggers triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. Feeding experiments indicate that NO is not produced from Arg but via conversion of nitrite by the nitrate reductase. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis shows that NO up-regulates the expression of the plastid nitrite reductase and genes involved in the subsequent incorporation of ammonium into amino acids, via both Gln synthesis and Orn-urea pathway. The phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is also up-regulated, leading to the production of acetyl-CoA, which can feed TAG accumulation upon exposure to NO. Transcriptional reprogramming leading to higher TAG content is balanced with a decrease of monogal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>osyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) in the plastid via posttranslational inhibition of MGDG synthase enzymatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity by NO.

DELLA-GAF1 Complex Is a Main Component in Gibberellin Feedback Regulation of GA20 Oxidase 2

Negative feedback regulation contributes to homeostasis of the GA level. DELLAs are negative regulators of GA signaling and are rapidly degraded in the presence of GAs. DELLAs regulate many target genes, including <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), encoding the GA-biosynthetic enzyme GA 20-oxidase. As DELLAs do not have an apparent DNA-binding motif, transcription f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ors that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> in association with DELLA are necessary for regulating the target genes.

Six-Rowed Spike3 (VRS3) Is a Histone Demethylase That Controls Lateral Spikelet Development in Barley
<p>The complex nature of crop genomes has long prohibited the efficient isolation of agronomically relevant genes. However, recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies provide new ways to accelerate fine-mapping and gene isolation in crops. We used RNA sequencing of allelic <i>six-rowed spike3</i> (<i>vrs3</i>) mutants with altered spikelet development for gene identification and functional analysis in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Variant calling in two allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed that <i>VRS3</i> encodes a putative histone Lys demethylase with a conserved zinc finger and Jumonji C and N domain. Sanger sequencing of this candidate gene in independent allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed a series of mutations in conserved domains, thus confirming our candidate as the <i>VRS3</i> gene and suggesting that the row type in barley is determined epigenetically. Global transcriptional profiling in developing shoot apical meristems of <i>vrs3</i> suggested that VRS3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as a transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivator of the row-type genes <i>VRS1</i> (<i>Hv.HOMEOBOX1</i>) and <i>INTERMEDIUM-C</i> (<i>INT-C</i>; <i>Hv.TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>).

<p>The transcription f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ors LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1), together with the AP1 paralog CAULIFLOWER (CAL), control the onset of flower development in a partially redundant manner. This redundancy is thought to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of a shared set of target genes. However, whether these genes are independently or cooperatively regulated by LFY and AP1/CAL is currently unknown. To better understand the regulatory relationship between LFY and AP1/CAL and to obtain deeper insights into the control of floral initiation, we monitored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity of LFY in the absence of AP1/CAL function. We found that the regulation of several known LFY target genes is unaffected by AP1/CAL perturbation, while others appear to require AP1/CAL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that LFY and AP1/CAL control the expression of some genes in an antagonistic manner. Notably, these include key regulators of floral initiation such as <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>), which had been previously reported to be directly repressed by both LFY and AP1. We show here that <i>TFL1</i> expression is suppressed by AP1 but promoted by LFY. We further demonstrate that LFY has an inhibitory effect on flower formation in the absence of AP1/CAL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity. We propose that LFY and AP1/CAL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as part of an incoherent feed-forward loop, a network motif where two interconnected pathways or transcription f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> in opposite directions on a target gene, to control the establishment of a stable developmental program for the formation of flowers.</p>

A Plant Cryptochrome Controls Key Features of the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Circadian Clock and Its Life Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-binding proteins that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as blue light receptors in b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>eria, fungi, plants, and insects and are components of the circadian oscillator in mammals. Animal and plant cryptochromes are evolutionarily divergent, although the unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas</i> throughout) has both an animal-like cryptochrome and a plant cryptochrome (pCRY; formerly designated CPH1). Here, we show that the pCRY protein accumulates at night as part of a complex. Functional char<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>erization of pCRY was performed based on an insertional mutant that expresses only 11% of the wild-type pCRY level. The <i>pcry</i> mutant is defective for central properties of the circadian clock. In the mutant, the period is lengthened significantly, ultimately resulting in arrhythmicity, while blue light-based phase shifts show large deviations from what is observed in wild-type cells. We also show that pCRY is involved in gametogenesis in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. pCRY is down-regulated in pregametes and gametes, and in the <i>pcry</i> mutant, there is altered transcript accumulation under blue light of the strictly light-dependent, gamete-specific gene <i>GAS28</i>. pCRY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as a negative regulator for the induction of mating ability in the light and for the loss of mating ability in the dark. Moreover, pCRY is necessary for light-dependent germination, during which the zygote undergoes meiosis that gives rise to four vegetative cells. In sum, our data demonstrate that pCRY is a key blue light receptor in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> that is involved in both circadian timing and life cycle progression.</p>

Histone Lysine-to-Methionine Mutations Reduce Histone Methylation and Cause Developmental Pleiotropy
<p>Epigenetic modifications play critical roles in diverse biological processes. Histone Lys-to-Met (K-to-M) mutations <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as gain-of-function mutations to inhibit a wide range of histone methyltransferases and are thought to promote tumorigenesis. However, it is largely unknown whether K-to-M mutations imp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> organismal development. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a model system, we discovered that a transgene exogenously expressing histone 3 Lys-36 to Met mutation (K36M) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s in a dominant-negative manner to cause global reduction of H3K36 methylation. Remarkably, this dominant repressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity is dosage-dependent and causes strong developmental perturbations including extreme branching and early flowering by affecting the expression of genes involved in developmental and metabolic processes. Besides the established pathological roles of K-to-M mutations in tumor cells, we demonstrate a physiological outcome for K-to-M induced H3K36 hypomethylation. This study provides evidence for a conserved dominant-negative inhibitory role of histone K-to-M mutation across the plant and animal kingdoms. We also highlight the unique ability of K36M mutations to alter plant developmental processes leading to severe pleiotropic phenotypes. Finally, our data suggests K-to-M mutations may provide a useful strategy for altering epigenetic landscapes in organisms where histone methyltransferases are unchar<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>erized.</p>

A Palmitic Acid Elongase Affects Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Plastidial Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Levels in Nannochloropsis
<p><i>Nannochloropsis</i> species are oleaginous eukaryotes containing a plastid limited by four membranes, deriving from a secondary endosymbiosis. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, thylakoid lipids, including monogal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>osyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. Fatty acids are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The production of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown process. We identified seven elongases and five desaturases possibly involved in EPA production in <i>Nannochloropsis gaditana</i>. Among the six heterokont-specific saturated FA elongases possibly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing upstream in this pathway, we char<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>erized the highly expressed isoform <i>Δ0-ELO1</i>. Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) showed that NgΔ0-ELO1 could elongate palmitic acid. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> Δ0-elo1 mutants exhibited a reduced EPA level and a specific decrease in MGDG. In NgΔ0-elo1 lines, the impairment of photosynthesis is consistent with a role of EPA-rich MGDG in nonphotochemical quenching control, possibly providing an appropriate MGDG platform for the xanthophyll cycle. Concomitantly with MGDG decrease, the level of triacylglycerol (TAG) containing medium chain FAs increased. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, part of EPA used for MGDG production is therefore biosynthesized by a channeled process initiated at the elongation step of palmitic acid by Δ0-ELO1, thus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing as a committing enzyme for gal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>olipid production. Based on the MGDG/TAG balance controlled by Δ0-ELO1, this study also provides novel prospects for the engineering of oleaginous microalgae for biotechnological applications.</p>

DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) Regulates Cell Walls in the Leaf Epidermis
<p>The plant epidermis is crucial to survival, regulating inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ions with the environment and controlling plant growth. The phytocalpain DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) is a master regulator of epidermal differentiation and maintenance, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing upstream of epidermis-specific transcription f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ors, and is required for correct cell adhesion. It is currently unclear how changes in DEK1 lead to cellular defects in the epidermis and the pathways through which DEK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s. We have combined growth kinematic studies, cell wall analysis, and transcriptional analysis of genes downstream of DEK1 to determine the cause of phenotypic changes observed in DEK1-modulated lines of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We reveal a novel role for DEK1 in the regulation of leaf epidermal cell wall structure. Lines with altered DEK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity have epidermis-specific changes in the thickness and polysaccharide composition of cell walls that likely underlie the loss of adhesion between epidermal cells in plants with reduced levels of DEK1 and changes in leaf shape and size in plants constitutively overexpressing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ive CALPAIN domain of DEK1. Calpain-overexpressing plants also have increased levels of cellulose and pectins in epidermal cell walls, and this is correlated with the expression of several cell wall-related genes, linking transcriptional regulation downstream of DEK1 with cellular effects. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the role of the epidermal cell walls in growth regulation and establish a new role for DEK1 in pathways regulating epidermal cell wall deposition and remodeling.</p>

Gibberellins Regulate Ovule Integument Development by Interfering with the Transcription Factor ATS
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that regulate most plant life cycle aspects, including flowering and fruit development. Here, we demonstrate the implication of GAs in ovule development.

The seeds of the <i>della global</i> mutant, a complete loss-of-function of DELLA, and the <i>ats-1</i> mutant are remarkably similar, with a round shape, a disorganized testa, and viviparism. These defects are the result of an alteration in integuments that fail to fully develop and are shorter than in wild-type plants. <i>ats-1</i> also shows some GA-related phenotypes, for example, higher germination rates and early flowering. In f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>, <i>ats-1</i> has elevated GA levels due to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivation of GA biosynthesis genes, which indicates that ATS inhibits GA biosynthesis. Moreover, DELLAs and ATS proteins inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>, which suggests the formation of a transcriptional complex that regulates the expression of genes involved in integument growth. Therefore, the repression of GA biosynthesis by ATS would result in the stabilization of DELLAs to ensure correct ATS-DELLA complex formation.

Retrotransposon-Mediated Aluminum Tolerance through Enhanced Expression of the Citrate Transporter OsFRDL4
<p>High aluminum (Al) tolerance of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is controlled by multiple tolerance genes, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differential expression of these genes are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ors regulating the expression of <i>OsFRDL4</i>, a gene encoding a citrate efflux transporter involved in Al-induced citrate secretion from the roots. Analysis with chromosome segment substitution lines derived from cv Nipponbare (high <i>OsFRDL4</i> expression) and cv Kasalath (low <i>OsFRDL4</i> expression) revealed that the differential expression of <i>OsFRDL4</i> is responsible for the quantitative trait locus for Al tolerance detected previously on chromosome 1. Comparison of the <i>OsFRDL4</i> gene structure in cv Nipponbare and cv Kasalath showed that there was no difference in the position of the transcriptional start site, but a 1.2-kb insertion showing high similarity to the solo long terminal repeat of the retrotransposon was found in the promoter region of <i>OsFRDL4</i> in cv Nipponbare. This insertion showed higher promoter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity and contained nine cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing elements for ALUMINUM RESISTANCE TRANSCRIPTION F<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>OR1 (ART1). However, this insertion did not alter the spatial expression or cellular localization of OsFRDL4. Furthermore, this insertion was found in most <i>japonica</i> varieties but was largely absent from <i>indica</i> varieties or wild rice species. These results indicate that the 1.2-kb insertion in the <i>OsFRDL4</i> promoter region in <i>japonica</i> subspecies is responsible for their higher expression level of <i>OsFRDL4</i> due to the increased number of cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing elements of ART1. Our results also suggest that this insertion event happened at the initial stage of domestication of <i>japonica</i> subspecies.</p>

Impaired Cyclic Electron Flow around Photosystem I Disturbs High-Light Respiratory Metabolism
<p>The cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (CEF-PSI) increases ATP/NADPH production in the chloroplast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing as an energy balance mechanism. Higher export of reducing power from the chloroplast in CEF-PSI mutants has been correlated with higher mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and protein amount under high-light (HL) conditions. However, in vivo measurements of AOX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity are still required to confirm the ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> role of AOX in dissipating the excess of reductant power from the chloroplast. Here, CEF-PSI single and double mutants were exposed to short-term HL conditions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Chlorophyll fluorescence, in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivities of the cytochrome oxidase (ν<sub>cyt</sub>) and AOX (ν<sub>alt</sub>) pathways, levels of mitochondrial proteins, metabolite profiles, and pyridine nucleotide levels were determined under normal growth and HL conditions. ν<sub>alt</sub> was not increased in CEF-PSI mutants, while AOX capacity was positively correlated with photoinhibition, probably due to a re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ive oxygen species-induced increase of AOX protein. The severe metabolic impairment observed in CEF-PSI mutants, as indicated by the increase in photoinhibition and changes in the levels of stress-related metabolites, can explain their lack of ν<sub>alt</sub> induction. By contrast, ν<sub>cyt</sub> was positively correlated with photosynthetic performance. Correlations with metabolite changes suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> is coordinated with sugar metabolism and stress-related amino acid synthesis. Furthermore, changes in glycine-serine and NADH-NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios were highly correlated to ν<sub>cyt</sub>. Taken together, our results suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as a sink for the excess of electrons from the chloroplast, probably via photorespiratory glycine oxidation, thus improving photosynthetic performance when ν<sub>alt</sub> is not induced under severe HL stress.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease genetics, and conservation biology. To estimate mutation rates and evaluate the effect of selection on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ing to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

The Developmental Brain Gene <i>NPAS3</i> Contains the Largest Number of Accelerated Regulatory Sequences in the Human Genome
<p>To identify the evolutionary genetic novelties that contributed to shape human-specific traits such as the use of a complex language, long-term planning and exceptional learning abilities is one of the ultimate frontiers of modern biology. Evolutionary signatures of functional shifts could be detected by comparing noncoding regions that are highly conserved across mammals or primates and rapidly accumulated nucleotide substitutions only in the lineage leading to humans. As gene loci densely populated with human-accelerated elements (HAEs) are more likely to have contributed to human-specific novelties, we sought to identify the transcriptional units and genomic 1 Mb intervals of the entire human genome carrying the highest number of HAEs. To this end, we took advantage of four available data sets of human genomic accelerated regions obtained through different comparisons and algorithms and performed a meta-analysis of the combined data. We found that the brain developmental transcription f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>or <i>neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3</i> (<i>NPAS3</i>) contains the largest cluster of noncoding-accelerated regions in the human genome with up to 14 elements that are highly conserved in mammals, including primates, but carry human-specific nucleotide substitutions. We then tested the ability of the 14 HAEs identified at the <i>NPAS3</i> locus to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as transcriptional regulatory sequences in a reporter expression assay performed in transgenic zebrafish. We found that 11 out of the 14 HAEs present in <i>NPAS3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as transcriptional enhancers during development, particularly within the nervous system. As <i>NPAS3</i> is known to play a crucial role during mammalian brain development, our results indicate that the high density of HAEs present in the human <i>NPAS3</i> locus could have modified the spatiotemporal expression pattern of <i>NPAS3</i> in the developing human brain and, therefore, contributed to human brain evolution.</p>

Augmentation of Muscle Blood Flow by Ultrasound Cavitation Is Mediated by ATP and Purinergic Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Augmentation of tissue blood flow by therapeutic ultrasound is thought to rely on convective shear.

Microvascular perfusion was evaluated by low-power contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging. In vivo muscle ATP release and in vitro ATP release from endothelial cells or erythrocytes were assessed by a luciferin-luciferase assay. Purinergic signaling pathways were assessed by studying interventions that (1) accelerated ATP degradation; (2) inhibited P2Y receptors, adenosine receptors, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels; or (3) inhibited downstream signaling pathways involving endothelial nitric oxide synthase or prostanoid production (indomethacin). Augmentation in muscle perfusion by ultrasound cavitation was assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 12 subjects with stable sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound cavitation increased muscle perfusion by 7-fold in normal mice, reversed tissue ischemia for up to 24 hours in the murine model of peripheral artery disease, and doubled muscle perfusion in patients with sickle cell disease.

Ultrasound cavitation produced an ≈40-fold focal and sustained increase in ATP, the source of which included both endothelial cells and erythrocytes.

Opposing microtubule motors control motility, morphology and cargo segregation during ER-to-Golgi transport
<p>We recently demonstrated that dynein and kinesin motors drive multiple aspects of endosomal function in mammalian cells. These functions include driving motility, maintaining morphology (notably through providing longitudinal tension to support vesicle fission), and driving cargo sorting. Microtubule motors drive bidirectional motility during traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Here, we have examined the role of microtubule motors in transport carrier motility, morphology, and domain organization during ER-to-Golgi transport. We show that, consistent with our findings for endosomal dynamics, microtubule motor function during ER-to-Golgi transport of secretory cargo is required for motility, morphology, and cargo sorting within vesicular tubular carriers <i>en route</i> to the Golgi. Our data are consistent with previous findings that defined roles for dynein-1, kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-2 in this trafficking step. Our high resolution tracking data identify some intriguing aspects. Depletion of kinesin-1 reduces the number of motile structures seen, which is in line with other findings relating to the role of kinesin-1 in ER export. However, those transport carriers that were produced had a much greater run length suggesting that this motor can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as a brake on anterograde motility. Kinesin-2 depletion did not significantly reduce the number of motile transport carriers but did cause a similar increase in run length. These data suggest that kinesins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong> as negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi transport. Depletion of dynein not only reduced the number of motile carriers formed but also caused tubulation of carriers similar to that seen for sorting nexin-coated early endosomes. Our data indicated that the previously observed anterograde–retrograde polarity of transport carriers in transit to the Golgi from the ER is maintained by microtubule motor function.</p>

Moderate excess of pyruvate augments osteoclastogenesis
<p>Cell differentiation leads to adaptive changes in energy metabolism. Conversely, hyperglycemia induces malfunction of many body systems, including bone, suggesting that energy metabolism reciprocally affects cell differentiation. We investigated how the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, large polykaryons formed through fusion and growth of cells of monocytic origin, is affected by excess of energy substrate pyruvate and how energy metabolism changes during osteoclast differentiation. Surprisingly, small increases in pyruvate (1–2 mM above basal levels) augmented osteoclastogenesis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while larger increases were not effective <i>in vitro</i>. Osteoclast differentiation increased cell mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivity and ATP levels, which were further augmented in energy-rich conditions. Conversely, the inhibition of respiration significantly reduced osteoclast number and size. AMP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivated protein kinase (AMPK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s as a metabolic sensor, which is inhibited in energy-rich conditions. We found that osteoclast differentiation was associated with an increase in AMPK levels and a change in AMPK isoform composition. Increased osteoclast size induced by pyruvate (1 mM above basal levels) was prevented in the presence of AMPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>ivator 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). In keeping, inhibition of AMPK using dorsomorphin or siRNA to AMPKγ increased osteoclast size in control cultures to the level observed in the presence of pyruvate. Thus, we have found that a moderate excess of pyruvate enhances osteoclastogenesis, and that AMPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">act</span></strong>s to tailor osteoclastogenesis to a cell's bioenergetics capacity.</p>

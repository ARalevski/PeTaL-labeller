All-oxide–based synthetic antiferromagnets exhibiting layer-resolved magnetization reversal
<p>Synthesizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong></span></strong>s with correlated oxides has been challenging, owing partly to the markedly degraded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ism of the magnetic layer at nanoscale thicknesses. Here we report on the engineering of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic interlayer exchange coupling (AF-IEC) between ultrathin but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic La<sub>2/3</sub>Ca<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> layers across an insulating CaRu<sub>1/2</sub>Ti<sub>1/2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> spacer. The layer-resolved magnetic switching leads to sharp steplike hysteresis loops with magnetization plateaus depending on the repetition number of the stacking bilayers. The magnetization configurations can be switched at moderate fields of hundreds of oersted. Moreover, the AF-IEC can also be realized with an alternative magnetic layer of La<sub>2/3</sub>Sr<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> that possesses a Curie temperature near room temperature. The findings will add functionalities to devices with correlated-oxide interfaces.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D materials at the nanoscale with single-spin microscopy
<p>The discovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals has generated widespread interest. Making further progress in this area requires quantitative knowledge of the magnetic properties of vdW magnets at the nanoscale. We used scanning single-spin magnetometry based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers to image the magnetization, localized defects, and magnetic domains of atomically thin crystals of the vdW magnet chromium(III) iodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>). We determined the magnetization of CrI<sub>3</sub> monolayers to be ≈16 Bohr magnetons per square nanometer, with comparable values in samples with odd numbers of layers; however, the magnetization vanishes when the number of layers is even. We also found that structural modifications can induce switching between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic interlayer ordering. These results demonstrate the benefit of using single-spin scanning magnetometry to study the magnetism of 2D vdW magnets.</p>

Electrical generation and detection of spin waves in a quantum Hall ferromagnet
<p>Spin waves are collective excitations of magnetic systems. An attractive setting for studying long-lived spin-wave physics is the quantum Hall (QH) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>, which forms spontaneously in clean two-dimensional electron systems at low temperature and in a perpendicular magnetic field. We used out-of-equilibrium occupation of QH edge channels in graphene to excite and detect spin waves in magnetically ordered QH states. Our experiments provide direct evidence for long-distance spin-wave propagation through different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic phases in the <i>N</i> = 0 Landau level, as well as across the insulating canted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic phase. Our results will enable experimental investigation of the fundamental magnetic properties of these exotic two-dimensional electron systems.</p>

Spin-imbalance in a 2D Fermi-Hubbard system
<p>The interplay of strong interactions and magnetic fields gives rise to unusual forms of superconductivity and magnetism in quantum many-body systems. Here, we present an experimental study of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model—a paradigm for strongly correlated fermions on a lattice—in the presence of a Zeeman field and varying doping. Using site-resolved measurements, we revealed anisotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic correlations, a precursor to long-range canted order. We observed nonmonotonic behavior of the local polarization with doping for strong interactions, which we attribute to the evolution from an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic insulator to a metallic phase. Our results pave the way to experimentally mapping the low-temperature phase diagram of the Fermi-Hubbard model as a function of both doping and spin polarization, for which many open questions remain.</p>

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The dynamics of many-body systems spanning condensed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase transitions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose condensates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives condensates across an effectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the condensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.</p>

Chirally coupled nanomagnets
<p>Magnetically coupled nanomagnets have multiple applications in nonvolatile memories, logic gates, and sensors. The most effective couplings have been found to occur between the magnetic layers in a vertical stack. We achieved strong coupling of laterally adjacent nanomagnets using the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This coupling is mediated by chiral domain walls between out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic regions and dominates the behavior of nanomagnets below a critical size. We used this concept to realize lateral exchange bias, field-free current-induced switching between multistate magnetic configurations as well as synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong></span></strong>s, skyrmions, and artificial spin ices covering a broad range of length scales and topologies. Our work provides a platform to design arrays of correlated nanomagnets and to achieve all-electric control of planar logic gates and memory devices.</p>

Phase transitions in a programmable quantum spin glass simulator
<p>Understanding magnetic phases in quantum mechanical systems is one of the essential goals in condensed matter physics, and the advent of prototype quantum simulation hardware has provided new tools for experimentally probing such systems. We report on the experimental realization of a quantum simulation of interacting Ising spins on three-dimensional cubic lattices up to dimensions 8 × 8 × 8 on a D-Wave processor (D-Wave Systems, Burnaby, Canada). The ability to control and read out the state of individual spins provides direct access to several order parameters, which we used to determine the lattice’s magnetic phases as well as critical disorder and one of its universal exponents. By tuning the degree of disorder and effective transverse magnetic field, we observed phase transitions between a paramagnetic, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic, and a spin-glass phase.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D van der Waals crystalline insulators via electron tunneling
<p>Magnetic insulators are a key resource for next-generation spintronic and topological devices. The family of layered metal halides promises varied magnetic states, including ultrathin insulating multiferroics, spin liquids, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>s, but device-oriented characterization methods are needed to unlock their potential. Here, we report tunneling through the layered magnetic insulator CrI<sub>3</sub> as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. We electrically detect the magnetic ground state and interlayer coupling and observe a field-induced metamagnetic transition. The metamagnetic transition results in magnetoresistances of 95, 300, and 550% for bilayer, trilayer, and tetralayer CrI<sub>3</sub> barriers, respectively. We further measure inelastic tunneling spectra for our junctions, unveiling a rich spectrum consistent with collective magnetic excitations (magnons) in CrI<sub>3</sub>.</p>

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures
<p>Magnetic multilayer devices that exploit magnetoresistance are the backbone of magnetic sensing and data storage technologies. Here, we report multiple-spin-filter magnetic tunnel junctions (sf-MTJs) based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which atomically thin chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) acts as a spin-filter tunnel barrier sandwiched between graphene contacts. We demonstrate tunneling magnetoresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for magnetic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures. Using magnetic circular dichroism measurements, we attribute these effects to the intrinsic layer-by-layer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic ordering of the atomically thin CrI<sub>3</sub>. Our work reveals the possibility to push magnetic information storage to the atomically thin limit and highlights CrI<sub>3</sub> as a superlative magnetic tunnel barrier for vdW heterostructure spintronic devices.</p>

Two-dimensional sp<sup>2</sup> carbon–conjugated covalent organic frameworks
<p>We synthesized a two-dimensional (2D) crystalline covalent organic framework (sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF) that was designed to be fully π-conjugated and constructed from all sp<sup>2</sup> carbons by C=C condensation reactions of tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene and 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile. The C=C linkages topologically connect pyrene knots at regular intervals into a 2D lattice with π conjugations extended along both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions and develop an eclipsed layer framework rather than the more conventionally obtained disordered structures. The sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF is a semiconductor with a discrete band gap of 1.9 electron volts and can be chemically oxidized to enhance conductivity by 12 orders of magnitude. The generated radicals are confined on the pyrene knots, enabling the formation of a paramagnetic carbon structure with high spin density. The sp<sup>2</sup> carbon framework induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic phase transition to develop spin-spin coherence and align spins unidirectionally across the material.</p>

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators
<p>Topological phases, like the Haldane phase in spin-1 chains, defy characterization through local order parameters. Instead, nonlocal string order parameters can be employed to reveal their hidden order. Similar diluted magnetic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of spin-charge separation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden magnetic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of nonlocal spin-density correlation functions reveals a hidden finite-range <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic order, a direct consequence of spin-charge separation. Our technique, which measures nonlocal order directly, can be readily extended to higher dimensions to study the complex interplay between magnetic order and density fluctuations.</p>

Control and local measurement of the spin chemical potential in a magnetic insulator
<p>The spin chemical potential characterizes the tendency of spins to diffuse. Probing this quantity could provide insight into materials such as magnetic insulators and spin liquids and aid optimization of spintronic devices. Here we introduce single-spin magnetometry as a generic platform for nonperturbative, nanoscale characterization of spin chemical potentials. We experimentally realize this platform using diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers and use it to investigate magnons in a magnetic insulator, finding that the magnon chemical potential can be controlled by driving the system’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferromagnet</span></strong>ic resonance. We introduce a symmetry-based two-fluid theory describing the underlying magnon processes, measure the local thermomagnonic torque, and illustrate the detection sensitivity using electrically controlled spin injection. Our results pave the way for nanoscale control and imaging of spin transport in mesoscopic systems.</p>

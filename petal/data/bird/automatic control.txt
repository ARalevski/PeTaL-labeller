PGR5-Dependent Cyclic Electron Flow Protects Photosystem I under Fluctuating Light at Donor and Acceptor Sides
<p>In response to a sudden increase in light intensity, plants must cope with absorbed excess photon energy to protect photosystems from photodamage. Under fluctuating light, PSI is severely photodamaged in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>proton gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutant defective in the main pathway of PSI cyclic electron transport (CET). Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) reservation of electron sink capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH production ratio (acceptor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation) and (2) down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> for slowing down the electron flow toward PSI (donor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> backgrounds by introducing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hypersensitivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to luminal acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant background but restricted linear electron transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large electron sink and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>. Thus, donor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

Global Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Heart Failure and Preserved or Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We hypothesized that pulmonary venous hypertension in heart failure (HF) leads to predominate remodeling of pulmonary veins and that the severity of venous remodeling is associated with the severity of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with HF (n=108; 53 preserved and 55 reduced ejection fraction) with PH (HF-PH; pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] ≥40 mm Hg) were compared to normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>s (n=12) and patients with primary pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD; n=17).

Associations between PASP and venous or IV %IT remained significant after adjusting for arterial percent medial thickness and %IT and did not vary by HF type. In patients with right heart catheterization (30 HF-PH, 14 PVOD), similar associations between the transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular remodeling existed, with numerically stronger associations for venous and IV %IT.

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average plant oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> stomatal aperture.

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p>Drought stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced water availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in water-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to drought stress through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of stomatal aperture and water transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the drought tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by drought stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved water use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led drought-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of ABA homeostasis through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> point in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the ABA pathway.</p>

Transcription Factor Interplay between LEAFY and APETALA1/CAULIFLOWER during Floral Initiation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>

However, whether these genes are independently or cooperatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by LFY and AP1/CAL is currently unknown. To better understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory relationship between LFY and AP1/CAL and to obtain deeper insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of floral initiation, we monitored the activity of LFY in the absence of AP1/CAL function. We found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of several known LFY target genes is unaffected by AP1/CAL perturbation, while others appear to require AP1/CAL activity. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that LFY and AP1/CAL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> the expression of some genes in an antagonistic manner. Notably, these include key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of floral initiation such as <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>), which had been previously reported to be directly repressed by both LFY and AP1. We show here that <i>TFL1</i> expression is suppressed by AP1 but promoted by LFY. We further demonstrate that LFY has an inhibitory effect on flower formation in the absence of AP1/CAL activity. We propose that LFY and AP1/CAL act as part of an incoherent feed-forward loop, a network motif where two interconnected pathways or transcription factors act in opposite directions on a target gene, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> the establishment of a stable developmental program for the formation of flowers.</p>

Selective control of up-regulated and down-regulated genes by temporal patterns and doses of insulin
<p>Secretion of insulin transiently increases after eating, resulting in a high circulating concentration. Fasting limits insulin secretion, resulting in a low concentration of insulin in the circulation. We analyzed transcriptional responses to different temporal patterns and doses of insulin in the hepatoma FAO cells and identified 13 up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated and 16 down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated insulin-responsive genes (IRGs). The up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs responded more rapidly than did the down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs to transient stepwise or pulsatile increases in insulin concentration, whereas the down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs were repressed at lower concentrations of insulin than those required to stimulate the up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs. Mathematical modeling of the insulin response as two stages—(i) insulin signaling to transcription and (ii)transcription and mRNA stability—indicated that the first stage was the more rapid stage for the down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs, whereas the second stage of transcription was the more rapid stage for the up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs. A subset of the IRGs that were up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated or down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in the FAO cells was similarly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in the livers of rats injected with a single dose of insulin. Thus, not only can cells respond to insulin but they can also interpret the intensity and pattern of signal to produce distinct transcriptional responses. These results provide insight that may be useful in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes associated with aberrant insulin production or tissue responsiveness.</p>

Modulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> signaling and ion transport by recruitment of kinases and phosphatases mediated by the regulatory protein IRBIT
<p>IRBIT is a multifunctional protein that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>s the activity of various epithelial ion transporters including NBCe1-B. Interaction with IRBIT increases NBCe1-B activity and exposes two cryptic Cl<sup>−</sup>-sensing GXXXP sites that enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of NBCe1-B by intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>). Here, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that IRBIT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led five phosphorylation sites in NBCe1-B that determined both the active conformation of the transporter and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Mutational analysis suggested that the phosphorylation status of Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by IRBIT and determined whether NBCe1 transporters are in active or inactive conformations. The absence of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, or Ser<sup>235</sup> produced NBCe1-B in the conformations pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, or pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup>, respectively. The activity of the pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form was similar to that of IRBIT-activated NBCe1-B, but it was insensitive to inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. The properties of the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form were similar to those of wild-type NBCe1-B, whereas the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup> form was partially active, further activated by IRBIT, but retained inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Furthermore, IRBIT recruited the phosphatase PP1 and the kinase SPAK to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> phosphorylation of Ser<sup>65</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>32</sup>GXXXP<sup>36</sup> motif.

The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under visible and UV-B light. The mode of transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate <i>HY5</i> transcription and also posttranscriptionally modulate HY5 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in visible and UV-B light signal transduction in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> expression is induced by UV-B radiation in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates its transcript levels. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interaction studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no evidence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interaction, and they primarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B radiation, BBX31 promotes the accumulation of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B radiation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating genes involved in photoprotection and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner.

We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root growth inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of root growth and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of root growth response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of Al-induced root growth inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator MYC2 was up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root growth inhibition under Al stress was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root growth inhibition is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.</p>

Feedback regulation of COOLAIR expression controls seed dormancy and flowering time

SUPPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA (SUF4) Supports Gamete Fusion via Regulating Arabidopsis <i>EC1</i> Gene Expression
<p>The <i>EGG CELL1</i> (<i>EC1</i>) gene family of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) comprises five members that are specifically expressed in the egg cell and redundantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> gamete fusion during double fertilization. We investigated the activity of all five <i>EC1</i> promoters in promoter-deletion studies and identified SUF4 (SUPPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA4), a C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> transcription factor, as a direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of the <i>EC1</i> gene expression. In particular, we demonstrated that SUF4 binds to all five Arabidopsis <i>EC1</i> promoters, thus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating their expression. The down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>SUF4</i> in homozygous <i>suf4-1</i> ovules results in reduced <i>EC1</i> expression and delayed sperm fusion, which can be rescued by expressing SUF4-β-glucuronidase under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of the <i>SUF4</i> promoter. To identify more gene products able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate <i>EC1</i> expression together with SUF4, we performed coexpression studies that led to the identification of <i>MOM1</i> (<i>MORPHEUS’ MOLECULE1</i>), a component of a silencing mechanism that is independent of DNA methylation marks.

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer funct</span></strong>ion) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer funct</span></strong>ion reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993.

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have a far worse prognosis than those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). In the intact heart, SSc-PAH exhibits depressed rest and reserve right ventricular (RV) contractility compared with IPAH. We tested whether this disparity involves underlying differences in myofilament function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac myocytes were isolated from RV septal endomyocardial biopsies from patients with SSc-PAH, IPAH, or SSc with exertional dyspnea but no resting PAH (SSc-d); <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> RV septal tissue was obtained from nondiseased donor hearts (6–7 per group). Isolated myocyte passive length-tension and developed tension-calcium relationships were determined and correlated with in vivo RV function and reserve. RV septal fibrosis was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocyte passive stiffness from length-tension relations was similarly increased in IPAH and SSc-PAH compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>, although SSc-PAH biopsies had more interstitial fibrosis. More striking disparities were found between active force-calcium relations. Compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>s, maximal calcium-activated force (F<sub>max</sub>) was 28% higher in IPAH but 37% lower in SSc-PAH. F<sub>max</sub> in SSc-d was intermediate between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> and SSc-PAH. The calcium concentration required for half-maximal force (EC<sub>50</sub>) was similar between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>, IPAH, and SSc-d but lower in SSc-PAH. This disparity disappeared in myocytes incubated with the active catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Myocyte F<sub>max</sub> directly correlated with in vivo RV contractility assessed by end-systolic elastance (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.46, <i>P</i>=0.002) and change in end-systolic elastance with exercise (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.49, <i>P</i>=0.008) and was inversely related with exercise-induced chamber dilation (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.63, <i>P</i><0.002), which also was a marker of depressed contractile reserve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A primary defect in human SSc-PAH resides in depressed sarcomere function, whereas this is enhanced in IPAH. These disparities correlate with in vivo RV contractility and contractile reserve and are consistent with worse clinical outcomes in SSc-PAH. The existence of sarcomere disease before the development of resting PAH in patients with SSc-d suggests that earlier identification and intervention may prove useful.</p></sec>

Patients With Long-QT Syndrome Caused by Impaired <i>hERG</i>-Encoded K<sub>v</sub>11.1 Potassium Channel Have Exaggerated Endocrine Pancreatic and Incretin Function Associated With Reactive Hypoglycemia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Loss-of-function mutations in <i>hERG</i> (encoding the K<sub>v</sub>11.1 voltage-gated potassium channel) cause long-QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) because of prolonged cardiac repolarization. However, K<sub>v</sub>11.1 is also present in pancreatic α and β cells and intestinal L and K cells, secreting glucagon, insulin, and the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide), respectively. These hormones are crucial for glucose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation, and long-QT syndrome may cause disturbed glucose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. We measured secretion of these hormones and cardiac repolarization in response to glucose ingestion in LQT2 patients with functional mutations in <i>hERG</i> and matched healthy participants, testing the hypothesis that LQT2 patients have increased incretin and β-cell function and decreased α-cell function, and thus lower glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Eleven patients with LQT2 and 22 sex-, age-, and body mass index–matched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> participants underwent a 6-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with ECG recording and blood sampling for measurements of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In comparison with matched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> participants, LQT2 patients had 56% to 78% increased serum insulin, serum C-peptide, plasma GLP-1, and plasma GIP responses (<i>P</i>=0.03–0.001) and decreased plasma glucose levels after glucose ingestion (<i>P</i>=0.02) with more symptoms of hypoglycemia (<i>P</i>=0.04).

A MYB Triad Controls Primary and Phenylpropanoid Metabolites for Pollen Coat Patterning
<p>The pollen wall is a complex, durable structure essential for plant reproduction. A substantial portion of phenylpropanoids (e.g. flavonols) produced by pollen grain tapetal cells are deposited in the pollen wall. Transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of pollen wall formation has been studied extensively, and a specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory mechanism for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) pollen flavonol biosynthesis has been postulated.

MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 Controls Cell Fate Transition during Stomatal Development
<p>Stomata on the plant epidermis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> gas and water exchange and are formed by MAPK-dependent processes. Although the contribution of MAP KINASE3 (MPK3) and MPK6 (MPK3/MPK6) to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of stomatal patterning and differentiation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) has been examined extensively, how they are inactivated and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate distinct stages of stomatal development is unknown. Here, we identify a dual-specificity phosphatase, MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1), which promotes stomatal cell fate transition by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>ling MAPK activation at the early stage of stomatal development. Loss of function of <i>MKP1</i> creates clusters of small cells that fail to differentiate into stomata, resulting in the formation of patches of pavement cells. We show that MKP1 acts downstream of YODA (a MAPK kinase kinase) but upstream of MPK3/MPK6 in the stomatal signaling pathway and that MKP1 deficiency causes stomatal signal-induced MAPK hyperactivation in vivo. By expressing MKP1 in the three discrete cell types of stomatal lineage, we further identified that MKP1-mediated deactivation of MAPKs in early stomatal precursor cells directs cell fate transition leading to stomatal differentiation. Together, our data reveal the important role of MKP1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>ling MAPK signaling specificity and cell fate decision during stomatal development.</p>

Regulation of Sucrose Transporters and Phloem Loading in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>Suc transporters (SUTs) play a key role in the allocation and partitioning of photosynthetically fixed carbon in plants. While a function could be assigned to many members of the SUT family, almost no information is available on their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. Here, the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of SUTs in response to various environmental stimuli in the leaves of five dicots (Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>], soybean [<i>Glycine max</i>], potato [<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>], tomato [<i>Solanum</i> <i>lycopersicum</i>], and poplar [<i>Populus</i> spp.]) and four monocots (maize [<i>Zea</i> <i>mays</i>], rice [<i>Oryza sativa</i>], wheat [<i>Triticum aestivum</i>], and barley [<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>]) was investigated. Extensive data on expression of <i>SUT</i>s in relation to changes of environmental conditions were obtained through a global analysis of 168 transcriptomics data sets. Results were validated by quantitative PCR measurements and extended by the measurement of photosynthesis rate and phloem sugar content to draw insight on the correlation of <i>SUT</i> expression and sugar export from leaves. For the apoplasmic phloem loaders, a clear difference in transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation in response to different environmental stimuli was observed. The consistent patterns of <i>SUT</i> expression under abiotic stress indicates which types of SUTs are involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of leaf sugar status and in stress signaling. Furthermore, it is shown that down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of phloem loading is likely to be caused by transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of SUTs, while up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation depends on post-transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. In poplar, expression of <i>PtaSUT4</i> was found to consistently respond to environmental stimuli, suggesting a significant role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of sugar export from leaves in this passive symplasmic phloem loader.</p>

Tissue-Specific Control of the Endocycle by the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome Inhibitors UVI4 and DEL1<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The endocycle represents a modified mitotic cell cycle that in plants is often coupled to cell enlargement and differentiation. Endocycle onset is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led by activity of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting cell-cycle factors for destruction. CELL CYCLE SWITCH52 (CCS52) proteins represent rate-limiting activator subunits of the APC/C. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), mutations in either <i>CCS52A1</i> or <i>CCS52A2</i> activators result in a delayed endocycle onset, whereas their overexpression triggers increased DNA ploidy levels. Here, the relative contribution of the APC/C<sup>CCS52A1</sup> and APC/C<sup>CCS52A2</sup> complexes to different developmental processes was studied through analysis of their negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators, being the ULTRAVIOLET-B-INSENSITIVE4 protein and the DP-E2F-Like1 transcriptional repressor, respectively.

Light Controls Cytokinin Signaling via Transcriptional Regulation of Constitutively Active Sensor Histidine Kinase CKI1
<p>In plants, the multistep phosphorelay (MSP) pathway mediates a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory processes, including those activated by cytokinins. The cross talk between cytokinin response and light has been known for a long time. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between light and cytokinin signaling remains elusive. In the screen for upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators we identified a <i>LONG PALE HYPOCOTYL</i> (<i>LPH</i>) gene whose activity is indispensable for spatiotemporally correct expression of <i>CYTOKININ INDEPENDENT1</i> (<i>CKI1</i>), encoding the constitutively active sensor His kinase that activates MSP signaling. <i>lph</i> is a new allele of <i>HEME OXYGENASE1</i> (<i>HY1</i>) that encodes the key protein in the biosynthesis of phytochromobilin, a cofactor of photoconvertible phytochromes. Our analysis confirmed the light-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the <i>CKI1</i> expression pattern. We show that <i>CKI1</i> expression is under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of phytochrome A (phyA), functioning as a dual (both positive and negative) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of <i>CKI1</i> expression, presumably via the phyA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated transcription factors (TF) PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1. Changes in <i>CKI1</i> expression observed in <i>lph</i>/<i>hy1</i>-<i>7</i> and <i>phy</i> mutants correlate with mis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of MSP signaling, changed cytokinin sensitivity, and developmental aberrations that were previously shown to be associated with cytokinin and/or CKI1 action. Besides that, we demonstrate a novel role of phyA-dependent <i>CKI1</i> expression in the hypocotyl elongation and hook development during skotomorphogenesis. Based on these results, we propose that the light-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>CKI1</i> provides a plausible mechanistic link underlying the well-known interaction between light- and cytokinin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led plant development.</p>

Genome Wide Analysis of Fatty Acid Desaturation and Its Response to Temperature

In developing seeds, this response is largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led by the activities of the microsomal ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acid desaturases, FAD2 and FAD3.

Here, we have characterized the response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed lipids to variation in ambient temperature and found that heat inhibits both ω-6 and ω-3 desaturation in phosphatidylcholine, leading to a proportional change in triacylglycerol composition. Analysis of the 19 parental accessions of the multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population showed that significant natural variation exists in the temperature responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation. A combination of quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using the MAGIC population suggests that ω-6 desaturation is largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led by cis-acting sequence variants in the <i>FAD2</i> 5′ untranslated region intron that determine the expression level of the gene.

Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed coat suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed coat permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating their expression.

A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the rapid-flowering accession Bd21 and the delayed-flowering accession Bd1-1 were grown in a variety of environmental conditions to enable exploration of the genetic architecture of flowering time. A genotyping-by-sequencing approach was used to develop SNP markers for genetic map construction, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> differences in flowering time were identified.

Genetic Dissection of Fe-Dependent Signaling in Root Developmental Responses to Phosphate Deficiency
<p>The inhibition of primary root (PR) growth is a major developmental response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Previous studies have independently uncovered key roles of the LOW PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (LPR1) ferroxidase, the tonoplast-localized ALUMINUM SENSITIVE3 (ALS3)/SENSITIVE TO ALUMINUM RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STAR1) transporter complex, and the SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1; a transcription factor)-ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (ALMT1; a malate transporter) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory module in mediating this response by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>ling iron (Fe) homeostasis in roots, but how these three components interact to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate PR growth under Pi deficiency remains unknown. Here, we dissected genetic relationships among these three key components and found that (1) STOP1, ALMT1, and LPR1 act downstream of ALS3/STAR1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>ling PR growth under Pi deficiency; (2) ALS3/STAR1 inhibits the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway by repressing STOP1 protein accumulation in the nucleus; and (3) STOP1-ALMT1 and LPR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> PR growth under Pi deficiency in an interdependent manner involving the promotion of malate-dependent Fe accumulation in roots. Furthermore, this malate-mediated Fe accumulation depends on external Pi availability. We also performed a detailed analysis of the dynamic changes in the tissue-specific Fe accumulation patterns in the root tips of plants exposed to Pi deficiency. The results indicate that the degree of inhibition of PR growth induced by Pi deficiency is not linked to the level of Fe accumulated in the root apical meristem or the elongation zone. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the root developmental response to Pi deficiency.</p>

ALTERED MERISTEM PROGRAM1 Restricts Shoot Meristem Proliferation and Regeneration by Limiting HD-ZIP III-Mediated Expression of RAP2.6L
<p>Plants show an indeterminate mode of growth by the activity of organ forming stem cell niches in apically positioned meristems. The correct formation and activity of these meristems are a prerequisite for their adaptive development and also allow the maintenance of organogenesis under adverse circumstances such as wounding. Mutation of the putative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Glu carboxypeptidase ALTERED MERISTEM PROGRAM1 (AMP1) results in Arabidopsis plants with enlarged shoot apical meristems, supernumerary stem cell pools, and higher leaf formation rate. AMP1 deficiency also causes exaggerated de novo formation of shoot meristems. The activity of AMP1 has been implicated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of microRNA (miRNA)-dependent translation; however, it is not known how this function contributes to the shoot meristem defects. Here, we show that the transcription factor RAP2.6L is up<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in the Arabidopsis <i>amp1</i> mutant. Overexpression of RAP2.6L in the wild type causes <i>amp1</i> mutant-related phenotypic and molecular defects, including enhanced shoot regeneration in tissue culture. Conversely, inhibition of RAP2.6L in the <i>amp1</i> mutant suppresses stem cell hypertrophy and the regenerative capacity. We further provide evidence that <i>RAP2.6L</i> is under direct transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of miRNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated class III homeodomain-Leu zipper (HD-ZIP III) proteins, key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of shoot meristem development, which overaccumulate in the <i>amp1</i> mutant. Our results reveal a transcription factor module acting downstream of <i>AMP1</i> in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of shoot stem cell niche patterning. By positioning the HD-ZIP III/RAP2.6L module downstream of AMP1 function, we provide a mechanistic link between the role of AMP1 in miRNA-mediated translational repression and shoot stem cell specification.</p>

Auxin Contributes to the Intraorgan Regulation of Gene Expression in Response to Shade
<p>Plants sense and respond to light via multiple photoreceptors including phytochrome. The decreased ratio of red to far-red light that occurs under a canopy triggers shade-avoidance responses, which allow plants to compete with neighboring plants. The leaf acts as a photoperceptive organ in this response. In this study, we investigated how the shade stimulus is spatially processed within the cotyledon. We performed transcriptome analysis on microtissue samples collected from vascular and nonvascular regions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. In addition, we mechanically isolated and analyzed the vascular tissue. More genes were up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by the shade stimulus in vascular tissues than in mesophyll and epidermal tissues. The genes up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in the vasculature were functionally divergent and included many auxin-responsive genes, suggesting that various physiological/developmental processes might be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led by shade stimulus in the vasculature. We then investigated the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of these genes in the vascular tissues. A small vascular region within a cotyledon was irradiated with far-red light, and the response was compared with that when the whole seedling was irradiated with far-red light. Most of the auxin-responsive genes were not fully induced by the local irradiation, suggesting that perception of the shade stimulus requires that a wider area be exposed to far-red light or that a certain position in the mesophyll and epidermis of the cotyledon be irradiated. This result was consistent with a previous report that auxin synthesis genes are up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in the periphery of the cotyledon. Hence, auxin acts as an important intraorgan signaling factor that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>s the vascular shade response within the cotyledon.</p>

Type B Response Regulators Act As Central Integrators in Transcriptional Control of the Auxin Biosynthesis Enzyme TAA1
<p>During embryogenesis and organ formation, establishing proper gradient is critical for auxin function, which is achieved through coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of both auxin metabolism and transport. Expression of auxin biosynthetic genes is often tissue specific and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by environmental signals. However, the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of a key auxin biosynthetic gene, <sc>l</sc>-Tryptophan aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1 (<i>TAA1</i>). A canonical and a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator (ARR) binding site were identified in the promoter and the second intron of <i>TAA1</i>, which were required for its tissue-specific expression. C-termini of a subset of the type B ARRs selectively bind to one or both cis elements and activate the expression of <i>TAA1</i>. We further demonstrated that the ARRs not only mediate the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>TAA1</i> by cytokinins, but also mediate its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation by ethylene, light, and developmental signals. Through direct protein-protein interactions, the transcriptional activity of ARR1 is enhanced by ARR12, DELLAs, and ethylene-insenstive3 (EIN3). Our study thus revealed the ARR proteins act as key node that mediate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of auxin biosynthesis by various hormonal, environmental, and developmental signals through transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the key auxin biosynthesis gene <i>TAA1</i>.</p>

DELLA-GAF1 Complex Is a Main Component in Gibberellin Feedback Regulation of GA20 Oxidase 2
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate many aspects of plant growth and development, including germination, elongation, flowering, and floral development. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">negative feedback</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation contributes to homeostasis of the GA level. DELLAs are negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of GA signaling and are rapidly degraded in the presence of GAs. DELLAs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate many target genes, including <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), encoding the GA-biosynthetic enzyme GA 20-oxidase. As DELLAs do not have an apparent DNA-binding motif, transcription factors that act in association with DELLA are necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating the target genes. Previous studies have identified GAI-ASSOCIATED FACTOR1 (GAF1) as such a DELLA interactor, with which DELLAs act as coactivators, and <i>AtGA20ox2</i> was identified as a target gene of the DELLA-GAF1 complex. In this study, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that four GAF1-binding sites exist in the <i>AtGA20ox2</i> promoter. Using transgenic plants, we further evaluated the contribution of the DELLA-GAF1 complex to GA feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. Mutations in four GAF1-binding sites abolished the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">negative feedback</span></strong> of <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in transgenic plants.

Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering plants, the female gametophyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>s pollen tube reception immediately before fertilization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates seed development immediately after fertilization, although the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>ling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for pollen tube reception by the female gametophyte before fertilization and the initiation of seed development after fertilization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the female gametophyte and in the zygote and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the developing seeds was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old seedlings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in pollen or pollen tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in seeds. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in seeds, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of seed development. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double fertilization and supported the model that a passage through the female gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in seeds and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>s early seed development.</p>

The BABY BOOM Transcription Factor Activates the LEC1-ABI3-FUS3-LEC2 Network to Induce Somatic Embryogenesis
<p>Somatic embryogenesis is an example of induced cellular totipotency, where embryos develop from vegetative cells rather than from gamete fusion. Somatic embryogenesis can be induced in vitro by exposing explants to growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators and/or stress treatments. The BABY BOOM (BBM) and LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) and LEC2 transcription factors are key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of plant cell totipotency, as ectopic overexpression of either transcription factor induces somatic embryo formation from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings without exogenous growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators or stress treatments. Although LEC and BBM proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate the same developmental process, it is not known whether they function in the same molecular pathway. We show that BBM transcriptionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates <i>LEC1</i> and <i>LEC2</i>, as well as the two other <i>LAFL</i> genes, <i>FUSCA3</i> (<i>FUS3</i>) and <i>ABSCISIC ACID</i> <i>INSENSITIVE3</i> (<i>ABI3</i>). LEC2 and ABI3 quantitatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis, while FUS3 and LEC1 are essential for this process. BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis is dose and context dependent, and the context-dependent phenotypes are associated with differential <i>LAFL</i> expression. We also uncover functional redundancy for somatic embryogenesis among other Arabidopsis BBM-like proteins and show that one of these proteins, PLETHORA2, also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates <i>LAFL</i> gene expression.

A PIF1/PIF3-HY5-BBX23 Transcription Factor Cascade Affects Photomorphogenesis
<p>Light signaling plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>ling higher plants’ early developmental process termed as photomorphogenesis. Transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation is a vital mechanism that is orchestrated by transcription factors and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory proteins working in concert to finely tune gene expression. Although many transcription factors/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators have been characterized in the light-signaling pathway, their inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation remains largely unknown. Here, we show that PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3) and PIF1 transcription factors directly bind to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory regions of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and a B-box gene BBX23 and activate their expression in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that BBX23 and its close homolog gene BBX22 play a redundant role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating hypocotyl growth, and that plants overexpressing BBX23 display reduced hypocotyl elongation under red, far-red, and blue light conditions. Intriguingly, BBX23 transcription is inhibited by light, whereas its protein is degraded in darkness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HY5 physically interacts with BBX23, and these two proteins coordinately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate the expression of both light-induced and light-repressed genes. BBX23 is also recruited to the promoter sequences of the light-responsive genes in a partial HY5-dependent manner. Taken together, our study reveals that the transcriptional cascade consisting of PIF1/PIF3, HY5, and BBX23 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>s photomorphogenesis, providing a transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory layer by which plants fine-tune their growth in response to changing light environment.</p>

Predictive Models of Spatial Transcriptional Response to High Salinity

Although our knowledge of how stress responses are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated is accumulating, a genome-wide model of how plant transcription factors (TFs) and cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory elements <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> spatially specific stress response has yet to emerge. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a model, we identified a set of 1,894 putative cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory elements (pCREs) that are associated with high-salinity (salt) up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated genes in the root or the shoot. We used these pCREs to develop computational models that can better predict salt up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated genes in the root and shoot compared with models based on known TF binding motifs. In addition, we incorporated TF binding sites identified via large-scale in vitro assays, chromatin accessibility, evolutionary conservation, and pCRE combinatorial relationships in machine learning models and found that only consideration of pCRE combinations led to better performance in salt up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation prediction in the root and shoot. Our results suggest that the plant organ transcriptional response to high salinity is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by a core set of pCREs and provide a genome-wide view of the cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory code of plant spatial transcriptional responses to environmental stress.</p>

Three Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors Protect Cell Wall Integrity for Arabidopsis Immunity to <i>Botrytis</i>
<p>Infection by necrotrophs is a complex process that starts with the breakdown of the cell wall (CW) matrix initiated by CW-degrading enzymes and results in an extensive tissue maceration. Plants exploit induced defense mechanisms based on biochemical modification of the CW components to protect themselves from enzymatic degradation. The pectin matrix is the main CW target of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, and pectin methylesterification status is strongly altered in response to infection. The methylesterification of pectin is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led mainly by pectin methylesterases (PMEs), whose activity is posttranscriptionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by endogenous protein inhibitors (PMEIs). Here, AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 are identified as functional PMEIs induced in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) during <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. AtPMEI expression is strictly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling, while only AtPMEI11 expression is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led by PME-related damage-associated molecular patterns, such as oligogalacturonides and methanol. The decrease of pectin methylesterification during infection is higher and the immunity to <i>B. cinerea</i> is compromised in <i>pmei10</i>, <i>pmei11</i>, and <i>pmei12</i> mutants with respect to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> plants. A higher stimulation of the fungal oxalic acid biosynthetic pathway also can contribute to the higher susceptibility of <i>pmei</i> mutants. The lack of <i>PMEI</i> expression does not affect hemicellulose strengthening, callose deposition, and the synthesis of structural defense proteins, proposed as CW-remodeling mechanisms exploited by Arabidopsis to resist CW degradation upon <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. We show that PME activity and pectin methylesterification are dynamically modulated by PMEIs during <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. Our findings point to AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 as mediators of CW integrity maintenance in plant immunity.</p>

DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) Regulates Cell Walls in the Leaf Epidermis

The phytocalpain DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) is a master <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of epidermal differentiation and maintenance, acting upstream of epidermis-specific transcription factors, and is required for correct cell adhesion. It is currently unclear how changes in DEK1 lead to cellular defects in the epidermis and the pathways through which DEK1 acts. We have combined growth kinematic studies, cell wall analysis, and transcriptional analysis of genes downstream of DEK1 to determine the cause of phenotypic changes observed in DEK1-modulated lines of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We reveal a novel role for DEK1 in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of leaf epidermal cell wall structure. Lines with altered DEK1 activity have epidermis-specific changes in the thickness and polysaccharide composition of cell walls that likely underlie the loss of adhesion between epidermal cells in plants with reduced levels of DEK1 and changes in leaf shape and size in plants constitutively overexpressing the active CALPAIN domain of DEK1. Calpain-overexpressing plants also have increased levels of cellulose and pectins in epidermal cell walls, and this is correlated with the expression of several cell wall-related genes, linking transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation downstream of DEK1 with cellular effects. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the role of the epidermal cell walls in growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation and establish a new role for DEK1 in pathways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating epidermal cell wall deposition and remodeling.</p>

Molecular Evolution of the Yap/Yorkie Proto-Oncogene and Elucidation of Its Core Transcriptional Program

Precisely how these signaling cassettes were assembled in early animal evolution remains poorly understood, as do the molecular transitions that potentiated the acquisition of their myriad developmental functions.

Based on heterologous functional analysis of evolutionarily distant Yap/Yorkie orthologs, we demonstrate that a structurally distinct interaction interface between Yap/Yorkie and its partner TEAD/Scalloped became fixed in the eumetazoan common ancestor. We then combine transcriptional profiling of tissues expressing phylogenetically diverse forms of Yap/Yorkie with ChIP-seq validation to identify a common downstream gene expression program underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of tissue growth in <i>Drosophila</i>.

Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates affects the response of pH<sub>i</sub> to <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in cells isolated from <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i>. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we simultaneously characterised the pH<sub>i</sub> response in host coral cells and their dinoflagellate symbionts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states under saturating light, with and without the photosynthetic inhibitor DCMU. Each treatment was run under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> (pH 7.8) and CO<sub>2</sub>-acidified seawater conditions (decreasing pH from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of CO<sub>2</sub> addition, by which time the external pH (pH<sub>e</sub>) had declined to 6.8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their pH<sub>i</sub> by 0.5 pH units above <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO<sub>2</sub> addition (0.2 pH unit drop in pH<sub>e</sub>) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0.3–0.4 pH units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the pH<sub>i</sub> of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the pH<sub>i</sub> recovered to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> levels when photsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that photosynthetic activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from cellular acidosis after exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>/low pH.</p>

Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (<i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>)

While experiments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in <i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia desert. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led for non-numerical continuous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density.

In the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> group   the ATD was -0.6 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 7.8) and the CTD was 32.5 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 10.2).   These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001).   The mean HHS and SF-36 scores were 68.4 (<sc>sd</sc> 25.0) and 62.0   (<sc>sd</sc> 27.7) for the DTT group and 73.2 (<sc>sd</sc> 24.2)   and 73.3 (<sc>sd</sc> 21.5) for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> group, respectively.

Vitamin E diffused highly cross-linked polyethylene in total hip arthroplasty at five years
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The objective of this five-year prospective, blinded, randomised   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led trial (RCT) was to compare femoral head penetration into   a vitamin E diffused highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) liner   with penetration into a medium cross-linked polyethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>   liner using radiostereometric analysis. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients scheduled for total hip arthroplasty (THA) were randomised   to receive either the study E1 (32 patients) or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> ArComXL   polyethylene (35 patients). The median age (range) of the overall   cohort was 66 years (40 to 76).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The five-year median (interquartile range) proximal femoral head   penetration into the E1 was -0.05 mm (-0.13 to -0.02) and 0.07 mm   (-0.03 to 0.16) for ArComXL. At three and five years, the penetration   was significantly greater in the ArComXL group compared with the   E1 group (p = 0.029 and p = 0.019, respectively). All patient-reported outcomes   (PROs) improved significantly from the pre-operative interval compared   with those at one year, and remained favourable at five years. There   were no differences between the two groups at any interval.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The five-year results showed that E1 polyethylene does not wear   more than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>, ArComXL.

Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic in total knee arthroplasty; is posterior capsular infiltration worth the risk?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic provides effective   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of pain in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).   There is little information about the added benefits of posterior   capsular infiltration (PCI) using different combinations of local   anaesthetic agents. Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness   of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong> of pain using multimodal infiltration with and without   infiltration of the posterior capsule of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, randomised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led trial of patients scheduled   for unilateral primary TKA, 86 were assigned to be treated with   multimodal infiltration with (Group I) or without (Group II) PCI.   Routine associated analgesia included the use of bupivacaine, morphine,   ketorolac and epinephrine. All patients had spinal anaesthesia and patient-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong></span></strong>led   analgesia (PCA) post-operatively. A visual analogue scale (VAS)   for pain and the use of morphine were recorded 24 hours post-operatively.   Side effects of the infiltration, blood loss, and length of stay   in hospital were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no statistically significant differences between the   groups in relation to: VAS pain scores in the first 24 hours post-operatively   (p = 0.693), the use of morphine in the PCA (p = 0.647), blood loss   (p = 0.625), and length of stay (p = 0.17). There were no neurovascular   complications in either group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic with infiltration   of the posterior capsule did not provide significant added analgesic   benefits or reduce the use of morphine after TKA. Multimodal infiltration   is a satisfactory technique for the management of pain in these   patients without the attendant risks of PCI.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017; 99-B:483–8.</p></sec>

Congenital Heart Defects and Indices of Placental and Fetal Growth in a Nationwide Study of 924 422 Liveborn Infants
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Congenital heart defects (CHDs) have been associated with placental anomalies. The nature and the consequences of this association remain poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the associations between all major subtypes of CHD and placental weight at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>, and the association between placental weight and measures of both overall and cerebral growth in fetuses with CHD, as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included all 924 422 liveborn Danish singletons, 1997 to 2011. CHD was present in 7569. We compared mean differences in placental weight <i>z</i> score between newborns with CHD and newborns without CHD by multivariable linear regression adjusted for potential confounders.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CHD was associated with a mean <i>z</i> score difference of –0.04 (95% confidence interval, –0.07 to –0.02). Some subtypes were associated with smaller placental size at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>: tetralogy of Fallot, –0.45 (95% confidence interval, –0.58 to –0.31); double-outlet right ventricle, –0.48 (95% confidence interval, –0.87 to –0.10); major ventricular septal defects, –0.41 (95% confidence interval, –0.52 to –0.29). Placental weight <i>z</i> score was associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> weight and head circumference <i>z</i> scores in all subtypes. In the 3 mentioned subtypes, the mean deviations from the population mean head circumference and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> weight <i>z</i> scores were reduced by up to 66% with adjustment for placental weight <i>z</i> score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Three subtypes of CHD were associated with lower placental weight, and placental weight was associated with measures of both overall growth and cerebral growth in fetuses with all subtypes of CHD.

Late presentation of developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Despite the presence of screening programmes, infants continue   to present with late developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), the   impact of which is significant. The aim of this study was to assess   infants with late presenting dislocation of the hip despite universal   clinical neonatal and selective ultrasound screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 01 January 1997 to 31 December 2011, a prospective, longitudinal   study was undertaken of a cohort of 64 670 live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>s. Late presenting   dislocation was defined as presentation after three months of age.   Diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound and plain radiography. Patient   demographics, referral type, reason for referral, risk factors (breech   presentation/strong family history) and clinical and radiological   findings were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 31 infants with an irreducible dislocation of the   hip, an incidence of 0.48   (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.68) per 1000 live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>s.   Of these, 18 (0.28 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.44) per 1000 live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>s; 58%)   presented late. All infants had a documented normal newborn clinical   examination and no abnormality reported in the six to eight week   check. Of the 18 late presenting cases 72% (n = 13) had no risk   factors: 16 were referred by GPs and two were late due to administrative   issues (missed appointments).

Sphingosine 1-phosphate stimulates eyelid closure in the developing rat by stimulating EGFR signaling
<p>In many mammals, the eyelids migrate over the eye and fuse during embryogenesis to protect the cornea from damage during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> and early life. Loss-of-function mutations affecting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway cause an eyes-open-at-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> (EOB) phenotype in rodents. We identified an insertional mutation in <i>Spinster homolog 2</i> (<i>Spns2</i>) in a strain of transgenic rats exhibiting the EOB phenotype. Spns2, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) transporter that releases S1P from cells, was enriched at the tip of developing eyelids in wild-type rat embryos. <i>Spns2</i> expression or treatment with S1P or any one of several EGFR ligands rescued the EOB <i>Spns2</i> mutant phenotype in vivo and in tissue explants in vitro and rescued the formation of stress fibers in primary keratinocytes from mutants. S1P signaled through the receptors S1PR1, S1PR2, and S1PR3 to activate extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and EGFR-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1)–c-Jun signaling. S1P also induced the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor MAL in a manner dependent on EGFR signaling. MAL and c-Jun stimulated the expression of the microRNAs <i>miR-21</i> and <i>miR-222</i>, both of which target the metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP3, thus promoting metalloprotease activity. The metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 stimulated EGFR signaling by cleaving a membrane-anchored form of EGF to release the ligand. Our results outline a network by which S1P transactivates EGFR signaling through a complex mechanism involving feedback between several intra- and extracellular molecules to promote eyelid fusion in the developing rat.</p>

Temperature-activated ion channels in neural crest cells confer maternal fever–associated birth defects
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> defects of the heart and face are common, and most have no known genetic cause, suggesting a role for environmental factors. Maternal fever during the first trimester is an environmental risk factor linked to these defects. Neural crest cells are precursor populations essential to the development of both at-risk tissues. We report that two heat-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, TRPV1 and TRPV4, were present in neural crest cells during critical windows of heart and face development. TRPV1 antagonists protected against the development of hyperthermia-induced defects in chick embryos. Treatment with chemical agonists of TRPV1 or TRPV4 replicated hyperthermia-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> defects in chick and zebrafish embryos. To test whether transient TRPV channel permeability in neural crest cells was sufficient to induce these defects, we engineered iron-binding modifications to TRPV1 and TRPV4 that enabled remote and noninvasive activation of these channels in specific cellular locations and at specific developmental times in chick embryos with radio-frequency electromagnetic fields. Transient stimulation of radio frequency–controlled TRP channels in neural crest cells replicated fever-associated defects in developing chick embryos. Our data provide a previously undescribed mechanism for congenital defects, whereby hyperthermia activates ion channels that negatively affect fetal development.</p>

Adult neurogenesis in mammals
<p>The first claim, in the early 1960s, that neurons could be generated in the postnatal mammalian brain was met with considerable skepticism and controversy (<i>1</i>). Over the next 20 years, each subsequent study reporting adult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain was greeted similarly (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). A dogma had been established and accepted by the scientific community: After <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>, no new neurons could be generated. Conceptually, it was thought that the structural composition of the neurons within the brain remained unchangeable after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>. However, the detection of adult neurogenesis in certain regions of the brain suggested that the adult brain exhibits more plasticity than previously thought, and this has implications for concepts of self, memory, and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

Risk of Dementia in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>More children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are surviving to adulthood, and CHD is associated with risk factors for dementia. We compared the risk of dementia in CHD adults to that of the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this cohort study, we used medical registries and a medical record review covering all Danish hospitals to identify adults with CHD diagnosed between 1963 and 2012. These individuals with CHD were followed from January 1, 1981, 30 years of age, or date of first CHD registration (index date for matched members of the general population cohort) until hospital diagnosis of dementia, death, emigration, or end of study (December 31, 2012). For each individual with CHD, we identified 10 members of the general population utilizing the Danish Civil Registration System matched on sex and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> year. We computed cumulative incidences and hazard ratios (HRs) of dementia, adjusting for sex and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cumulative incidence of dementia was 4% by 80 years of age in 10 632 adults with CHD (46% male).

The HR among individuals with CHD without extracardiac defects was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1−1.8). Adults with mild-to-moderate CHD had an HR of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1−2.0), whereas the HR was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2−3.3) for severe CHD, including univentricular hearts.

Diversity, Disparity, and Evolutionary Rate Estimation for Unresolved Yule Trees
<p>The branching structure of biological evolution confers statistical dependencies on phenotypic trait values in related organisms. For this reason, comparative macroevolutionary studies usually begin with an inferred phylogeny that describes the evolutionary relationships of the organisms of interest. The probability of the observed trait data can be computed by assuming a model for trait evolution, such as Brownian motion, over the branches of this fixed tree. However, the phylogenetic tree itself contributes statistical uncertainty to estimates of rates of phenotypic evolution, and many comparative evolutionary biologists regard the tree as a nuisance parameter. In this article, we present a framework for analytically integrating over unknown phylogenetic trees in comparative evolutionary studies by assuming that the tree arises from a continuous-time Markov branching model called the Yule process. To do this, we derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of phylogenetic diversity (PD), which is the sum of branch lengths connecting the species in a clade. We then present a generalization of PD which is equivalent to the expected trait disparity in a set of taxa whose evolutionary relationships are generated by a Yule process and whose traits evolve by Brownian motion. We find expressions for the distribution of expected trait disparity under a Yule tree. Given one or more observations of trait disparity in a clade, we perform fast likelihood-based estimation of the Brownian variance for unresolved clades. Our method does not require simulation or a fixed phylogenetic tree. We conclude with a brief example illustrating Brownian rate estimation for 12 families in the mammalian order Carnivora, in which the phylogenetic tree for each family is unresolved.

Autologous grafting of cryopreserved prepubertal rhesus testis produces sperm and offspring
<p>Testicular tissue cryopreservation is an experimental method to preserve the fertility of prepubertal patients before they initiate gonadotoxic therapies for cancer or other conditions. Here we provide the proof of principle that cryopreserved prepubertal testicular tissues can be autologously grafted under the back skin or scrotal skin of castrated pubertal rhesus macaques and matured to produce functional sperm. During the 8- to 12-month observation period, grafts grew and produced testosterone. Complete spermatogenesis was confirmed in all grafts at the time of recovery. Graft-derived sperm were competent to fertilize rhesus oocytes, leading to preimplantation embryo development, pregnancy, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> of a healthy female baby. Pending the demonstration that similar results are obtained in noncastrated recipients, testicular tissue grafting may be applied in the clinic.</p>

Indonesian fatwa causes immunization rates to drop
<p>A massive vaccination campaign against measles and rubella in Indonesia is in trouble after the Indonesian Ulama Council in Jakarta issued a fatwa declaring the vaccine "<i>haram</i>," or forbidden under Islamic law, because pig components are used in its manufacturing. The council ruled that parents could still have their children vaccinated, given the need to protect public health. But many local clerics and confused parents have decided otherwise: The fatwa has led to a drop in vaccination rates, from 95% during the first phase of the campaign, last year on the island of Java, to 68% in the second phase, now in progress on the remaining islands.

Two Patched molecules engage distinct sites on Hedgehog yielding a signaling-competent complex
<p>Aberrant Hedgehog (HH) signaling leads to various types of cancer and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> defects. N-terminally palmitoylated HH initiates signaling by binding its receptor Patched-1 (PTCH1). A recent 1:1 PTCH1-HH complex structure visualized a palmitate-mediated binding site on HH, which was inconsistent with previous studies that implied a distinct, calcium-mediated binding site for PTCH1 and HH co-receptors. Our 3.5-angstrom resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of native Sonic Hedgehog (SHH-N) in complex with PTCH1 at a physiological calcium concentration reconciles these disparate findings and demonstrates that one SHH-N molecule engages both epitopes to bind two PTCH1 receptors in an asymmetric manner. Functional assays using PTCH1 or SHH-N mutants that disrupt the individual interfaces illustrate that simultaneous engagement of both interfaces is required for efficient signaling in cells.</p>

Staying slim during pregnancy carries a price
<p>Japan’s obsession with slender women may harm unborn children and create long-term health problems for the Japanese population. Already, one in five Japanese women is starting pregnancy underweight, and many scientists have criticized the country’s official guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy as too strict. Now, a new study shows that many pregnant women strive to keep their weight gain below even those targets. This combination of factors has produced an unusually high percentage of low weight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>s, which is likely the reason that the height of the average adult Japanese has declined every year for those born after 1980. The trend could create long-term health problems, scientists warn, and effect longevity. </p>

Noninvasive blood tests for fetal development predict gestational age and preterm delivery
<p>Noninvasive blood tests that provide information about fetal development and gestational age could potentially improve prenatal care. Ultrasound, the current gold standard, is not always affordable in low-resource settings and does not predict spontaneous preterm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>, a leading cause of infant death. In a pilot study of 31 healthy pregnant women, we found that measurement of nine cell-free RNA (cfRNA) transcripts in maternal blood predicted gestational age with comparable accuracy to ultrasound but at substantially lower cost. In a related study of 38 women (23 full-term and 15 preterm deliveries), all at elevated risk of delivering preterm, we identified seven cfRNA transcripts that accurately classified women who delivered preterm up to 2 months in advance of labor. These tests hold promise for prenatal care in both the developed and developing worlds, although they require validation in larger, blinded clinical trials.</p>

Human mutation rate a legacy from our past
<p>Humans should be more like paramecia. That's because their mutation rate is orders of magnitude lower than a human's. Those rates increase when genes involved in copying or repairing DNA stop working correctly. Although some mutations are good for generating variety that allows organisms to adapt to changing environments, too many can cause disease and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> defects. At a meeting in Tempe, Arizona, researchers documented mutation rates in dozens of species and found that the species's specific rate is inversely related to the so-called "effective population" size. Small populations are less able to get rid of or compensate for genetic changes that increase mutation rate. In the past, mutation rates were thought to be so stable that they were "molecular clocks" useful for dating species' divergences. But researchers are now recognizing that mutation rates vary from species to species.</p>

Study undercuts claims of new neurons in adult brains
<p>Over the past 20 years, evidence that adult humans can produce hundreds of new neurons per day has fueled hope that ramping up cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> could be therapeutic. Boosting neurogenesis, researchers speculate, might prevent or treat depression, Alzheimer's disease, and other brain disorders. But a controversial study in <i>Nature </i>this week threatens to dash such hopes by suggesting that the production of neurons declines sharply after early development and grinds to a halt by adulthood. The unsuccessful search for new neurons in adult human and monkey brains is disappointing to many. But skeptics also say that the study left much room for error, and that the debate is far from over.</p>

Glia relay differentiation cues to coordinate neuronal development in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> and specification must be coordinated across the developing brain to generate the neurons that constitute neural circuits. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system to investigate how development is coordinated to establish retinotopy, a feature of all visual systems. Photoreceptors achieve retinotopy by inducing their target field in the optic lobe, the lamina neurons, with a secreted differentiation cue, epidermal growth factor (EGF). We find that communication between photoreceptors and lamina cells requires a signaling relay through glia. In response to photoreceptor-EGF, glia produce insulin-like peptides, which induce lamina neuronal differentiation. Our study identifies a role for glia in coordinating neuronal development across distinct brain regions, thus reconciling the timing of column assembly with that of delayed differentiation, as well as the spatiotemporal pattern of lamina neuron differentiation.</p>

ELABELA deficiency promotes preeclampsia and cardiovascular malformations in mice
<p>Preeclampsia (PE) is a gestational hypertensive syndrome affecting between 5 and 8% of all pregnancies. Although PE is the leading cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality, its molecular etiology is still unclear. Here, we show that ELABELA (ELA), an endogenous ligand of the apelin receptor (APLNR, or APJ), is a circulating hormone secreted by the placenta. <i>Elabela</i> but not <i>Apelin</i> knockout pregnant mice exhibit PE-like symptoms, including proteinuria and elevated blood pressure due to defective placental angiogenesis. In mice, infusion of exogenous ELA normalizes hypertension, proteinuria, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> weight. ELA, which is abundant in human placentas, increases the invasiveness of trophoblast-like cells, suggesting that it enhances placental development to prevent PE. The ELA-APLNR signaling axis may offer a new paradigm for the treatment of common pregnancy-related complications, including PE.</p>

The fading American dream: Trends in absolute income mobility since 1940
<p>We estimated rates of “absolute income mobility”—the fraction of children who earn more than their parents—by combining data from U.S. Census and Current Population Survey cross sections with panel data from de-identified tax records. We found that rates of absolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90% for children born in 1940 to 50% for children born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> cohort would reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that reviving the “American dream” of high rates of absolute mobility would require economic growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribution.</p>

Extensive migration of young neurons into the infant human frontal lobe
<p>The first few months after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>, when a child begins to interact with the environment, are critical to human brain development. The human frontal lobe is important for social behavior and executive function; it has increased in size and complexity relative to other species, but the processes that have contributed to this expansion are unknown. Our studies of postmortem infant human brains revealed a collection of neurons that migrate and integrate widely into the frontal lobe during infancy. Chains of young neurons move tangentially close to the walls of the lateral ventricles and along blood vessels. These cells then individually disperse long distances to reach cortical tissue, where they differentiate and contribute to inhibitory circuits. Late-arriving interneurons could contribute to developmental plasticity, and the disruption of their postnatal migration or differentiation may underlie neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

Evolutionary Dynamics of Abundant Stop Codon Readthrough
<p>Translational stop codon readthrough emerged as a major regulatory mechanism affecting hundreds of genes in animal genomes, based on recent comparative genomics and ribosomal profiling evidence, but its evolutionary properties remain unknown. Here, we leverage comparative genomic evidence across 21 <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes to systematically annotate readthrough genes in the malaria vector <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and to provide the first study of abundant readthrough evolution, by comparison with 20 <i>Drosophila</i> species. Using improved comparative genomics methods for detecting readthrough, we identify evolutionary signatures of conserved, functional readthrough of 353 stop codons in the malaria vector, <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and of 51 additional <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> stop codons, including several cases of double and triple readthrough and of readthrough of two adjacent stop codons. We find that most differences between the readthrough repertoires of the two species arose from readthrough gain or loss in existing genes, rather than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> of new genes or gene death; that readthrough-associated RNA structures are sometimes gained or lost while readthrough persists; that readthrough is more likely to be lost at TAA and TAG stop codons; and that readthrough is under continued purifying evolutionary selection in mosquito, based on population genetic evidence. We also determine readthrough-associated gene properties that predate readthrough, and identify differences in the characteristic properties of readthrough genes between clades. We estimate more than 600 functional readthrough stop codons in mosquito and 900 in fruit fly, provide evidence of readthrough control of peroxisomal targeting, and refine the phylogenetic extent of abundant readthrough as following divergence from centipede.</p>

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> year, sex, and county with 10 control subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden. Follow-up data were collected until 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 21 982 patients (51.6% men) with CHD and 219 816 matched control subjects, 654 and 328 developed AF, respectively. The mean follow-up was 27 years. The risk of developing AF was 21.99 times higher (95% confidence interval, 19.26–25.12) in patients with CHD than control subjects. According to a hierarchical CHD classification, patients with conotruncal defects had the highest risk (hazard ratio, 84.27; 95% confidence interval, 56.86–124.89). At the age of 42 years, 8.3% of all patients with CHD had a recorded diagnosis of AF. Heart failure was the quantitatively most important complication in patients with CHD and AF, with a 10.7% (70 of 654) recorded diagnosis of heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The risk of AF in children and young adults with CHD was 22 times higher than that in matched control subjects. Up to the age of 42 years, 1 of 12 patients with CHD had developed AF, and 1 of 10 patients with CHD with AF had developed heart failure. The patient groups with the most complex congenital defects carried the greatest risk of AF and could be considered for targeted monitoring.</p></sec>

Higher Risk of Vascular Dementia in Myocardial Infarction Survivors
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Increased risk of dementia after myocardial infarction (MI) may be mediated by shared risk factors (eg, atherosclerosis) and post-MI stroke. We examined risk of dementia in 1-year survivors of MI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using Danish medical registries, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study of all patients with first-time MI and a sex-, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> year–, and calendar year–matched general population comparison cohort without MI (1980–2012). Cox regression analysis was used to compute 1- to 35-year adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for dementia, controlled for matching factors and adjusted for comorbidities and socioeconomic status.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 314 911 patients with MI and 1 573 193 matched comparison cohort members randomly sampled from the general population (median age, 70 years; 63% male). After 35 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of all-cause dementia in the MI cohort was 9% (2.8% for Alzheimer disease, 1.6% for vascular dementia, and 4.5% for other dementias). Compared with the general population cohort, MI was not associated with all-cause dementia (aHR, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98–1.03). Risk of Alzheimer disease (aHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.95) and other dementias (aHR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.95–1.01) also approximated unity. However, MI was associated with higher risk of vascular dementia (aHR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.28–1.43), which was substantially strengthened for patients experiencing stroke after MI (aHR, 4.48; 95% CI, 3.29–6.12).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>MI was associated with higher risk of vascular dementia throughout follow-up, and this association was stronger in patients with stroke. The risk of Alzheimer disease and other dementias was not higher in patients with MI.</p></sec>

Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation From Cardiac Procedures and Malignancy Risk in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) are exposed to increasing amounts of low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. Cancer prevalence in this population is higher than in the general population. This study estimates the association between LDIR exposure from cardiac procedures and incident cancer in adult patients with CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population derived from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database. We measured cumulative numbers of LDIR-related cardiac procedures for each patient until 1 year before the time of cancer diagnosis or administrative censoring. To assess the association between LDIR exposure and cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study and matched cancer cases with controls on sex, CHD severity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> year, and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study included 24 833 adult patients with CHD aged 18 to 64 years from 1995 to 2009. In >250 791 person-years of follow-up, 602 cancer cases were observed (median age, 55.4 years). The cumulative incidence of cancer estimated up to 64 years of age was 15.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.2–16.5). Cases had more LDIR-related cardiac procedures than controls (1410 versus 921 per 1000 adult patients with CHD, <i>P</i><0.0001). Cumulative LDIR exposure was independently associated with cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13). Similar results were obtained by using dose estimates for LDIR exposure (OR, 1.10 per 10 mSv; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15) with a possible dose-related response. The effect measure was in the same direction, and the association was persistent for exposure from ≥6 procedures in all sensitivity analyses: after excluding most smoking-related cancer cases (OR, 1.10 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.05–1.16 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.77–5.37), and after applying a 3-year lag period (OR, 1.09 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.03–1.14 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures: 2.58; 95% CI, 1.43–4.69).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based study to analyze and document the association between LDIR-related cardiac procedures and incident cancer in the population of adults with CHD. Confirmations of these findings by prospective studies are needed to reinforce policy recommendations for radiation surveillance in patients with CHD where no regulation currently exists. Physicians ordering and performing cardiac imaging should ensure that exposure is as low as reasonably achievable without sacrificing quality of care.</p></sec>

Multicellular Transcriptional Analysis of Mammalian Heart Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The inability of the adult mammalian heart to regenerate following injury represents a major barrier in cardiovascular medicine. In contrast, the neonatal mammalian heart retains a transient capacity for regeneration, which is lost shortly after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>. Defining the molecular mechanisms that govern regenerative capacity in the neonatal period remains a central goal in cardiac biology. Here, we assemble a transcriptomic framework of multiple cardiac cell populations during postnatal development and following injury, which enables comparative analyses of the regenerative (neonatal) versus nonregenerative (adult) state for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, leukocytes, and endothelial cells from infarcted and noninfarcted neonatal (P1) and adult (P56) mouse hearts were isolated by enzymatic dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting at day 3 following surgery. RNA sequencing was performed on these cell populations to generate the transcriptome of the major cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. To complement our transcriptomic data, we also surveyed the epigenetic landscape of cardiomyocytes during postnatal maturation by performing deep sequencing of accessible chromatin regions by using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin from purified mouse cardiomyocyte nuclei (P1, P14, and P56).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Profiling of cardiomyocyte and nonmyocyte transcriptional programs uncovered several injury-responsive genes across regenerative and nonregenerative time points. However, the majority of transcriptional changes in all cardiac cell types resulted from developmental maturation from neonatal stages to adulthood rather than activation of a distinct regeneration-specific gene program. Furthermore, adult leukocytes and fibroblasts were characterized by the expression of a proliferative gene expression network following infarction, which mirrored the neonatal state. In contrast, cardiomyocytes failed to reactivate the neonatal proliferative network following infarction, which was associated with loss of chromatin accessibility around cell cycle genes during postnatal maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work provides a comprehensive framework and transcriptional resource of multiple cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. Our findings define a regulatory program underpinning the neonatal regenerative state and identify alterations in the chromatin landscape that could limit reinduction of the regenerative program in adult cardiomyocytes.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Health Promotion in Children: Challenges and Opportunities for 2020 and Beyond: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>This document provides a pediatric-focused companion to “Defining and Setting National Goals for Cardiovascular Health Promotion and Disease Reduction: The American Heart Association’s Strategic Impact Goal Through 2020 and Beyond,” focused on cardiovascular health promotion and disease reduction in adults and children. The principles detailed in the document reflect the American Heart Association’s new dynamic and proactive goal to promote cardiovascular health throughout the life course. The primary focus is on adult cardiovascular health and disease prevention, but critical to achievement of this goal is maintenance of ideal cardiovascular health from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> through childhood to young adulthood and beyond. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles and metrics that define cardiovascular health in children for the clinical or research setting, and a balanced and critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the cardiovascular health construct in children and adolescents is provided. Specifically, this document discusses 2 important factors: the promotion of ideal cardiovascular health in all children and the improvement of cardiovascular health metric scores in children currently classified as having poor or intermediate cardiovascular health. Other topics include the current status of cardiovascular health in US children, opportunities for the refinement of health metrics, improvement of health metric scores, and possibilities for promoting ideal cardiovascular health. Importantly, concerns about the suitability of using single thresholds to identify elevated cardiovascular risk throughout the childhood years and the limits of our current knowledge are noted, and suggestions for future directions and research are provided.</p>

Pregnancy Loss and Later Risk of Atherosclerotic Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Pregnancy losses and atherosclerotic disease may be etiologically linked through underlying pathology. We examined whether miscarriage and still<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong> increase later risk of myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, and renovascular hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Among women pregnant at least once between 1977 and 2008, we identified a cohort of women with miscarriages, still<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>s, or live singleton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>s. These women were followed from the end of pregnancy for incident myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, and renovascular hypertension. Using Poisson regression, we estimated incidence rate ratios for each of the outcomes by history of miscarriage and still<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>. Among 1 031 279 women followed for >15 928 900 person-years, we identified 27 98 myocardial infarctions, 40 53 cerebral infarctions, and 1269 instances of renovascular hypertension. Women with still<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>s had 2.69 (95% confidence interval, 2.06–3.50), 1.74 (1.32–2.28), and 2.42 (1.59–3.69) times the rates of myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, and renovascular hypertension, respectively, as women with no still<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">birth</span></strong>s. Compared with women with no miscarriages, women with miscarriages had 1.13 (1.03–1.24), 1.16 (1.07–1.25), and 1.20 (1.05–1.38) times the rates of these same outcomes, respectively; these associations were dose dependent, with each additional miscarriage increasing the rates of myocardial and cerebral infarction and renovascular hypertension by 9% (3% to 16%), 13% (7% to 19%), and 19% (9% to 30%), respectively. Associations were strongest in younger women (<35 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Pregnancy losses were associated with subsequent risks of myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, and renovascular hypertension, consistent with either shared etiology or the initiation of pathological processes by a pregnancy loss leading to atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptation, pl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>t nuclei move centripetally toward the midpl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>e of the leaf blade; thus, the nuclei on both the adaxial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d abaxial sides become positioned at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear positioning implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mech<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>ism underlying this process. Here, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>GUSTIFOLIA (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear positioning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thali<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>a</i>) leaves. Two mut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>ts defective in the positioning of nuclei in the dark were isolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d designated as <i>unusual nuclear positioning1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, nuclei of <i>unp1</i> were positioned at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>ticlinal walls of adaxial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d abaxial mesophyll cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d abaxial pavement cells, whereas the nuclei of <i>unp2</i> were positioned at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>ticlinal walls of mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d pavement cells on both the adaxial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a domin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>t-negative mutation in <i>ACTIN7</i>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutation in <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong></i>. Actin filaments in <i>unp1</i> were fragmented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d pl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>t growth. The mutation in <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong></i> caused aberr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>t positioning of nuclei-associated actin filaments at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>ticlinal walls. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong> was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted physically with pl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>t-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-prop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>one signific<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>tly inhibited dark-induced nuclear positioning. Collectively, these results suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>-DYRKP complex regulates the alignment of actin filaments during centripetal nuclear positioning in leaf cells.</p>

Genome sequence of <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314
<p>Awamori is a traditional distilled beverage made from steamed Thai-Indica rice in Okinawa, Jap<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>. For brewing the liquor, two microbes, local kuro (black) koji mold <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d awamori yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> are involved. In contrast, that yeasts are used for eth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>ol fermentation throughout the world, a characteristic of Jap<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>ese fermentation industries is the use of <i>Aspergillus</i> molds as a source of enzymes for the maceration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d saccharification of raw materials. Here we report the draft genome of a kuro (black) koji mold, <i>A. luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314 (RIB 2604). The total length of nonredund<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>t sequences was nearly 34.7 Mb, comprising approximately 2,300 contigs with 16 telomere-like sequences. In total, 11,691 genes were predicted to encode proteins. Most of the housekeeping genes, such as tr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>scription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d <i>N</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d <i>O</i>-glycosylation system, were conserved with respect to <i>Aspergillus niger</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong> alternative oxidase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d acid-stable α-amylase regarding citric acid production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d fermentation at a low pH as well as a unique glutamic peptidase were also found in the genome.

An entirely automated method to score DSS-induced colitis in mice by digital image analysis of pathology slides
<p>The DSS (dextr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong> sulfate sodium) model of colitis is a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Microscopic symptoms include loss of crypt cells from the gut lining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d infiltration of inflammatory cells into the colon. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong> experienced pathologist requires several hours per study to score histological ch<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>ges in selected regions of the mouse gut. In order to increase the efficiency of scoring, Definiens Developer software was used to devise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong> entirely automated method to qu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>tify histological ch<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>ges in the whole H&E slide. When the algorithm was applied to slides from historical drug-discovery studies, automated scores classified 88% of drug c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>didates in the same way as pathologists’ scores. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>other automated image <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>alysis method was developed to qu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>tify colon-infiltrating macrophages, neutrophils, B cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d T cells in immunohistochemical stains of serial sections of the H&E slides.

A Critical Appraisal of Aspirin in Secondary Prevention
<p>Aspirin represents the <i>sine qua non</i> for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>tiplatelet pharmacotherapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases because of its well-established role in secondary prevention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d its widespread availability <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d affordability. Historical studies, conducted in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong> era that bears little resembl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>ce to contemporary clinical practice, demonstrated large reductions in thrombotic risk when aspirin was compared with placebo, thus forming the evidence base promulgated in practice guidelines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d recommendations. P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors have mostly been studied in addition to aspirin; dual-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>tiplatelet therapy proved superiority compared with aspirin monotherapy for the prevention of ischemic events, despite increased bleeding risks. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong> alternative approach currently under investigation includes evaluation of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>tiplatelet therapy with P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors alone versus dual-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>tiplatelet therapy after acute coronary syndromes or coronary stent impl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>tation. As the availability of more effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>tiplatelet agents increases, it is time to revisit the existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d long-st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>ding paradigm supporting aspirin use for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events. Ongoing trials will provide new evidence whether the less-is-more strategy is justified.</p>

Association Between Physician Follow-Up and Outcomes of Care After Chest Pain Assessment in High-Risk Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Assessment of chest pain is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits in developed countries.

Multivariable proportional hazard models were constructed to adjust for potential confounding between physici<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong> groups (cardiologist, PCP, or none). Among 56767 included patients, 17% were evaluated by cardiologists, 58% were evaluated by PCPs alone, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d 25% had no physici<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong> follow-up.

The highest rates of diagnostic testing, medical therapy, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an</span></strong>d coronary revascularization were seen among patients treated by cardiologists.

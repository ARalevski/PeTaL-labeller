A molecular perovskite solid solution with piezoelectricity stronger than lead zirconate titanate
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ic materials produce electricity when strained, making them ideal for different types of sensing applications. The most effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ic materials are ceramic solid solutions in which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ic effect is optimized at what are termed morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs). Ceramics are not ideal for a variety of applications owing to some of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechanical properti</span></strong>es. We synthesized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ic materials from a molecular perovskite (TMFM)<i><sub>x</sub></i>(TMCM)<sub>1–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>CdCl<sub>3</sub> solid solution (TMFM, trimethylfluoromethyl ammonium; TMCM, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium, 0 ≤ <i>x</i> ≤ 1), in which the MPB exists between monoclinic and hexagonal phases. We found a composition for which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ic coefficient <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> is ~1540 picocoulombs per newton, comparable to high-performance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ic ceramics. The material has potential applications for wearable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ic devices.</p>

Giant piezoelectricity of Sm-doped Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> single crystals
<p>High-performance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ics benefit transducers and sensors in a variety of electromechanical applications. The materials with the highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ic charge coefficients (<i>d</i><sub>33</sub>) are relaxor-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> crystals, which were discovered two decades ago. We successfully grew Sm-doped Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> (Sm-PMN-PT) single crystals with even higher <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> values ranging from 3400 to 4100 picocoulombs per newton, with variation below 20% over the as-grown crystal boule, exhibiting good property uniformity. We characterized the Sm-PMN-PT on the atomic scale with scanning transmission electron microscopy and made first-principles calculations to determine that the giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ic properties arise from the enhanced local structural heterogeneity introduced by Sm<sup>3+</sup> dopants. Rare-earth doping is thus identified as a general strategy for introducing local structural heterogeneity in order to enhance the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>icity of relaxor ferroelectric crystals.</p>

An organic-inorganic perovskite ferroelectric with large piezoelectric response
<p>Molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ics are highly desirable for their easy and environment-friendly processing, light weight, low processing temperature, and mechanical flexibility. However, although 136 years have passed since the discovery in 1880 of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ic effect, molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ics with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ic coefficient <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> comparable with piezoceramics such as barium titanate (BTO; ~190 picocoulombs per newton) have not been found. We show that trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese(II), an organic-inorganic perovskite ferroelectric crystal processed from aqueous solution, has a large <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> of 185 picocoulombs per newton and a high phase-transition temperature of 406 kelvin (K) (16 K above that of BTO). This makes it a competitive candidate for medical, micromechanical, and biomechanical applications.</p>

Flexo-photovoltaic effect
<p>It is highly desirable to discover photovoltaic mechanisms that enable enhanced efficiency of solar cells. Here we report that the bulk photovoltaic effect, which is free from the thermodynamic Shockley-Queisser limit but usually manifested only in noncentrosymmetric (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ic or ferroelectric) materials, can be realized in any semiconductor, including silicon, by mediation of flexoelectric effect. We used either an atomic force microscope or a micrometer-scale indentation system to introduce strain gradients, thus creating very large photovoltaic currents from centrosymmetric single crystals of strontium titanate, titanium dioxide, and silicon. This strain gradient–induced bulk photovoltaic effect, which we call the flexo-photovoltaic effect, functions in the absence of a p-n junction. This finding may extend present solar cell technologies by boosting the solar energy conversion efficiency from a wide pool of established semiconductors.</p>

Quantum acoustics with superconducting qubits
<p>Mechanical objects have important practical applications in the fields of quantum information and metrology as quantum memories or transducers for measuring and connecting different types of quantum systems. The field of electromechanics is in pursuit of a robust and highly coherent device that couples motion to nonlinear quantum objects such as superconducting qubits. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a high-frequency bulk acoustic wave resonator that is strongly coupled to a superconducting qubit using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">piezoelectr</span></strong>ic transduction with a cooperativity of 260. We measure qubit and mechanical coherence times on the order of 10 microseconds. Our device requires only simple fabrication methods and provides controllable access to a multitude of phonon modes. We demonstrate quantum control and measurement on gigahertz phonons at the single-quantum level.</p>

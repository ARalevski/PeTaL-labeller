CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart disease is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV disease (MVD), the cellular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart disease valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es including arginase-1 and resistin-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–1. Conditionally deleting the vascular cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart disease. We define key inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that drive MVD in this model, including Syk, TNF, interleukin-6, very late antigen–4, and vascular cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–1.</p></sec>

Probing and imaging spin interactions with a magnetic single-molecule sensor
<p>Magnetic single atoms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are receiving intensifying research focus because of their potential as the smallest possible memory, spintronic, and qubit elements. Scanning probe microscopes used to study these systems have benefited greatly from new techniques that use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e-functionalized tips to enhance spatial and spectroscopic resolutions and enable new sensing capabilities. We demonstrate a microscopy technique that uses a magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e, Ni(cyclopentadienyl)<sub>2</sub>, adsorbed at the apex of a scanning probe tip, to sense exchange interactions with another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e adsorbed on a Ag(110) surface in a continuously tunable fashion in all three spatial directions. We further used the probe to image contours of exchange interaction strength, revealing angstrom-scale regions where the quantum states of two magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es strongly mix. Our results pave the way for new nanoscale imaging capabilities based on magnetic single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e sensors.</p>

Observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K + <sup>40</sup>K collisions
<p>Resonances in ultracold collisions involving heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are difficult to simulate theoretically and have proven challenging to detect. Here we report the observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold collisions between potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K) atoms and sodium-23–potassium-40 (<sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in the rovibrational ground state.

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the diffusion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average diffusion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e imaging analysis, we found that the diffusion of receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average diffusion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a biological system with small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical biology. Small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es identified in screens designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

Synthetic transcription elongation factors license transcription across repressive chromatin

The resulting models accurately predicted odor intensity and pleasantness and also successfully predicted 8 among 19 rated semantic descriptors (“garlic,” “fish,” “sweet,” “fruit,” “burnt,” “spices,” “flower,” and “sour”). Regularized linear models performed nearly as well as random forest–based ones, with a predictive accuracy that closely approaches a key theoretical limit.

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

Covalent inhibitors of EGFR family protein kinases induce degradation of human Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) pseudokinase in cancer cells
<p>A major challenge associated with biochemical and cellular analysis of pseudokinases is a lack of target-validated small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e compounds with which to probe function. Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with a diverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There is substantial evidence that human TRIB2 promotes survival and drug resistance in solid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutic target. The unusual TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-rich C-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminal tail, which also supports its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases. We found that TRIB2 is a target of previously described small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e protein kinase inhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinase domains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Using a thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB2-binding compounds within the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and used a drug repurposing approach to classify compounds that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB2 in vitro. TRIB2 destabilizing agents, including the covalent drug afatinib, led to rapid TRIB2 degradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signaling and survival. Our data reveal new drug leads for the development of TRIB2-degrading compounds, which will also be invaluable for unraveling the cellular mechanisms of TRIB2-based signaling. Our study highlights that small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–induced protein down-regulation through drug “off-targets” might be relevant for other inhibitors that serendipitously target pseudokinases.</p>

Educated natural killer cells show dynamic movement of the activating receptor NKp46 and confinement of the inhibitory receptor Ly49A
<p>Educated natural killer (NK) cells have inhibitory receptors specific for self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es and kill cancer cells more efficiently than do NK cells that do not have such receptors (hyporesponsive NK cells). The mechanism behind this functional empowerment through education has so far not been fully described. In addition, distinctive phenotypic markers of educated NK cells at the single-cell level are lacking. We developed a refined version of the image mean square displacement (iMSD) method (called iMSD carpet analysis) and used it in combination with single-particle tracking to characterize the dynamics of the activating receptor NKp46 and the inhibitory receptor Ly49A on resting educated versus hyporesponsive murine NK cells. Most of the NKp46 and Ly49A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es were restricted to microdomains; however, individual NKp46 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es resided in these domains for shorter periods and diffused faster on the surface of educated, compared to hyporesponsive, NK cells. In contrast, the movement of Ly49A was more constrained in educated NK cells compared to hyporesponsive NK cells. Either disrupting the actin cytoskeleton or adding cholesterol to the cells prohibited activating signaling, suggesting that the dynamics of receptor movements within the cell membrane are critical for the proper activation of NK cells. The faster and more dynamic movement of NKp46 in educated NK cells may facilitate a swifter response to interactions with target cells.</p>

RhoB controls the Rab11-mediated recycling and surface reappearance of LFA-1 in migrating T lymphocytes
<p>The regulation of cell adhesion and motility is complex and requires the intracellular trafficking of integrins to and from sites of cell adhesion, especially in fast-moving cells such as leukocytes. The Rab family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) is essential for vesicle transport, and vesicles mediate intracellular integrin trafficking. We showed that RhoB regulates the vesicular transport of the integrin LFA-1 along the microtubule network in migrating T lymphocytes. Impairment in RhoB function resulted in the accumulation of both LFA-1 and the recycling endosomal marker Rab11 at the rear of migrating T lymphocytes and decreased the association between these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es. T lymphocytes lacking functional RhoB exhibited impaired recycling and subsequently decreased surface amounts of LFA-1, leading to reduced T cell adhesion and migration mediated by the cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–1). We propose that vesicle-associated RhoB is a regulator of the Rab11-mediated recycling of LFA-1 to the cell surface, an event that is necessary for T lymphocyte motility.</p>

Nematic-to-columnar mesophase transition by in situ supramolecular polymerization
<p>Disk- and rod-shaped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are incompatible in coassembly, as the former tend to stack one-dimensionally whereas the latter tend to align in parallel.

Bioenergetics through thick and thin
<p>The cells in all biological systems are composed of a limited number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar constituents, mainly proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids.

In recent years, and with the advent of advanced lipidomics techniques, we have learned that “a lipid is a lipid is a lipid” is simply not true, and that the lipid composition of membranes can have profound effects on the behavior and activity of its resident <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong></span></strong>es.

Regulating the femtosecond excited-state lifetime of a single molecule
<p>The key to controlling reactions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es induced with the current of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip is the ultrashort intermediate excited ionic state. The initial condition of the excited state is set by the energy and position of the injected current; thereafter, its dynamics determines the reaction outcome. We show that a STM can directly and controllably influence the excited-state dynamics. For the STM-induced desorption of toluene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es from the Si(111)-7x7 surface, as the tip approaches the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e, the probability of manipulation drops by two orders of magnitude. A two-channel quenching of the excited state is proposed, consisting of an invariant surface channel and a tip height–dependent channel. We conclude that picometer tip proximity regulates the lifetime of the excited state from 10 femtoseconds to less than 0.1 femtoseconds.</p>

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms
<p>Chemical reactions typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants. Going beyond this paradigm, we combined exactly two atoms in a single, controlled reaction. The experimental apparatus traps two individual laser-cooled atoms [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in separate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociation forms an excited-state NaCs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e. The discovery of previously unseen resonances near the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar dissociation threshold and measurement of collision rates are enabled by the tightly trapped ultracold sample of atoms. As laser-cooling and trapping capabilities are extended to more elements, the technique will enable the study of more diverse, and eventually more complex, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in an isolated environment, as well as synthesis of designer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es for qubits.</p>

Real-space and real-time observation of a plasmon-induced chemical reaction of a single molecule
<p>Plasmon-induced chemical reactions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es adsorbed on metal nanostructures are attracting increased attention for photocatalytic reactions. However, the mechanism remains controversial because of the difficulty of direct observation of the chemical reactions in the plasmonic field, which is strongly localized near the metal surface.

A cryofuge for cold-collision experiments with slow polar molecules

ATP as a biological hydrotrope
<p>Hydrotropes are small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that solubilize hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in aqueous solutions. Typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es and differ from classical surfactants in that they have low cooperativity of aggregation and work at molar concentrations. Here, we show that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has properties of a biological hydrotrope. It can both prevent the formation of and dissolve previously formed protein aggregates. This chemical property is manifested at physiological concentrations between 5 and 10 millimolar. Therefore, in addition to being an energy source for biological reactions, for which micromolar concentrations are sufficient, we propose that millimolar concentrations of ATP may act to keep proteins soluble. This may in part explain why ATP is maintained in such high concentrations in cells.</p>

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals
<p>Multiple human diseases ensue from a hereditary or acquired deficiency of iron-transporting protein function that diminishes transmembrane iron flux in distinct sites and directions. Because other iron-transport proteins remain active, labile iron gradients build up across the corresponding protein-deficient membranes. Here we report that a small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e natural product, hinokitiol, can harness such gradients to restore iron transport into, within, and/or out of cells. The same compound promotes gut iron absorption in DMT1-deficient rats and ferroportin-deficient mice, as well as hemoglobinization in DMT1- and mitoferrin-deficient zebrafish. These findings illuminate a general mechanistic framework for small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–mediated site- and direction-selective restoration of iron transport. They also suggest that small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that partially mimic the function of missing protein transporters of iron, and possibly other ions, may have potential in treating human diseases.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Phloem Transport of the Receptor DWARF14 Protein Is Required for Full Function of Strigolactones<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The cell-to-cell transport of signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es is essential for multicellular organisms to coordinate the action of their cells. Recent studies identified DWARF14 (D14) as a receptor of strigolactones (SLs), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that act as plant hormones and inhibit shoot branching. Here, we demonstrate that <i>RAMOSUS3</i>, a pea ortholog of <i>D14</i>, works as a graft-transmissible signal to suppress shoot branching. In addition, we show that D14 protein is contained in phloem sap and transported through the phloem to axillary buds in rice. SLs are not required for the transport of D14 protein. Disruption of D14 transport weakens the suppression of axillary bud outgrowth of rice. Taken together, we conclude that the D14 protein works as an intercellular signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e to fine-tune SL function. Our findings provide evidence that the intercellular transport of a receptor can regulate the action of plant hormones.</p>

Thus, these adhesins can attach to their target with exceptionally resilient mechanostability, virtually independent of peptide side chains.</p>

Molecular structure of human P-glycoprotein in the ATP-bound, outward-facing conformation
<p>The multidrug transporter permeability (P)–glycoprotein is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–binding cassette exporter responsible for clinical resistance to chemotherapy. P-glycoprotein extrudes toxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es and drugs from cells through ATP-powered conformational changes. Despite decades of effort, only the structures of the inward-facing conformation of P-glycoprotein are available. Here we present the structure of human P-glycoprotein in the outward-facing conformation, determined by cryo–electron microscopy at 3.4-angstrom resolution. The two nucleotide-binding domains form a closed dimer occluding two ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es. The drug-binding cavity observed in the inward-facing structures is reorientated toward the extracellular space and compressed to preclude substrate binding. This observation indicates that ATP binding, not hydrolysis, promotes substrate release. The structure evokes a model in which the dynamic nature of P-glycoprotein enables translocation of a large variety of substrates.</p>

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate immunity, a large part of which consists of one type of immune cell—the neutrophil. Neutrophils form the largest group of immune cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> neutrophils daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of toxic chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another neutrophil defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying neutrophils mix their nuclear DNA with toxic components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in the surrounding environment. This process is called NETosis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying genetic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this immobilization on NETs, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cytotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es on the NET-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming immune complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of NETs has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together degrade freshly formed NETs. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal immunopathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</p>

MHC I and MHC II clasp the peptides in a binding groove consisting of two antiparallel α helices that overlay an eight-stranded β sheet.

On page 672 of this issue, Terakawa <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) describe an activity associated with a protein complex called condensin that has the potential to answer this.

<p>Thermodynamic bulk measurements of binding reactions rely on the validity of the law of mass action and the assumption of a dilute solution. Yet, important biological systems such as allosteric ligand-receptor binding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong></span></strong>ar crowding, or misfolded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es may not follow these assumptions and may require a particular reaction model. Here we introduce a fluctuation theorem for ligand binding and an experimental approach using single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e force spectroscopy to determine binding energies, selectivity, and allostery of nucleic acids and peptides in a model-independent fashion. A similar approach could be used for proteins. This work extends the use of fluctuation theorems beyond uni<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar folding reactions, bridging the thermodynamics of small systems and the basic laws of chemical equilibrium.</p>

Spectroscopic snapshots of the proton-transfer mechanism in water
<p>The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high proton mobility in water as a sequence of proton transfers along a hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) network. However, the vibrational spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk water. Here we report how the much simpler vibrational spectra of cold, composition-selected heavy water clusters, D<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>, can be exploited to capture clear markers that encode the collective reaction coordinate along the proton-transfer event. By complexing the solvated hydronium “Eigen” cluster [D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>] with increasingly strong H-bond acceptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es (D<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO, and D<sub>2</sub>O), we are able to track the frequency of every O-D stretch vibration in the complex as the transferring hydron is incrementally pulled from the central hydronium to a neighboring water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e.</p>

Asymmetric synthesis of batrachotoxin: Enantiomeric toxins show functional divergence against Na<sub>V</sub>
<p>The steroidal neurotoxin (−)-batrachotoxin functions as a potent agonist of voltage-gated sodium ion channels (Na<sub>V</sub>s). Here we report concise asymmetric syntheses of the natural (−) and non-natural (+) antipodes of batrachotoxin, as well both enantiomers of a C-20 benzoate–modified derivative. Electrophysiological characterization of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es against Na<sub>V</sub> subtypes establishes the non-natural toxin enantiomer as a reversible antagonist of channel function, markedly different in activity from (−)-batrachotoxin. Protein mutagenesis experiments implicate a shared binding side for the enantiomers in the inner pore cavity of Na<sub>V</sub>. These findings motivate and enable subsequent studies aimed at revealing how small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that target the channel inner pore modulate Na<sub>V</sub> dynamics.</p>

Molecular force spectroscopy with a DNA origami–based nanoscopic force clamp
<p>Forces in biological systems are typically investigated at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e level with atomic force microscopy or optical and magnetic tweezers, but these techniques suffer from limited data throughput and their requirement for a physical connection to the macroscopic world. We introduce a self-assembled nanoscopic force clamp built from DNA that operates autonomously and allows massive parallelization. Single-stranded DNA sections of an origami structure acted as entropic springs and exerted controlled tension in the low piconewton range on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar system, whose conformational transitions were monitored by single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e Förster resonance energy transfer. We used the conformer switching of a Holliday junction as a benchmark and studied the TATA-binding protein–induced bending of a DNA duplex under tension. The observed suppression of bending above 10 piconewtons provides further evidence of mechanosensitivity in gene regulation.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Isoprene Acts as a Signaling Molecule in Gene Networks Important for Stress Responses and Plant Growth
<p>Isoprene synthase converts dimethylallyl diphosphate to isoprene and appears to be necessary and sufficient to allow plants to emit isoprene at significant rates. Isoprene can protect plants from abiotic stress but is not produced naturally by all plants; for example, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) do not produce isoprene. It is typically present at very low concentrations, suggesting a role as a signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e; however, its exact physiological role and mechanism of action are not fully understood. We transformed Arabidopsis with a <i>Eucalyptus globulus isoprene synthase</i>. The regulatory mechanisms of photosynthesis and isoprene emission were similar to those of native emitters, indicating that regulation of isoprene emission is not specific to isoprene-emitting species. Leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were enhanced by isoprene, which also had a marked positive effect on hypocotyl, cotyledon, leaf, and inflorescence growth in Arabidopsis. By contrast, leaf and stem growth was reduced in tobacco engineered to emit isoprene. Expression of genes belonging to signaling networks or associated with specific growth regulators (e.g. gibberellic acid that promotes growth and jasmonic acid that promotes defense) and genes that lead to stress tolerance was altered by isoprene emission. Isoprene likely executes its effects on growth and stress tolerance through direct regulation of gene expression. Enhancement of jasmonic acid-mediated defense signaling by isoprene may trigger a growth-defense tradeoff leading to variations in the growth response. Our data support a role for isoprene as a signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e.</p>

Leaf Endoplasmic Reticulum Bodies Identified in Arabidopsis Rosette Leaves Are Involved in Defense against Herbivory
<p>ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived organelles specific to the order Brassicales and are thought to function in plant defense against insects and pathogens. ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es are generally classified into two types: constitutive ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es in the epidermal cells of seedlings, and wound-inducible ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es in rosette leaves. Herein, we reveal a third type of ER body found in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette leaves and designate them “leaf ER<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es” (L-ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es). L-ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es constitutively occurred in specific cells of the rosette leaves: marginal cells, epidermal cells cove<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> the midrib, and giant pavement cells. The distribution of L-ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es was closely associated with the expression profile of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NAI1, which is responsible for constitutive ER-body formation. L-ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es were seldom observed in <i>nai1</i> mutant leaves, indicating that NAI1 is involved in L-ER body formation. Confocal imaging analysis revealed that L-ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es accumulated two types of β-glucosidases: PYK10, the constitutive ER-body β-glucosidase; and BETA-GLUCOSIDASE18 (BGLU18), the wound-inducible ER-body β-glucosidase. Combined with the absence of L-ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es in the <i>bglu18 pyk10</i> mutant, these results indicate that BGLU18 and PYK10 are the major components of L-ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es. A subsequent feeding assay with the terrestrial isopod <i>Armadillidium vulgare</i> revealed that <i>bglu18 pyk10</i> leaves were severely damaged as a result of herbivory. In addition, the <i>bglu18 pyk10</i> mutant was defective in the hydrolysis of 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate These results suggest that L-ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es are involved in the production of defensive compound(s) from 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate that protect Arabidopsis leaves against herbivory attack.</p>

Close-range remote sensing of Saturn’s rings during Cassini’s ring-grazing orbits and Grand Finale
<p>Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s are an accessible exemplar of an astrophysical disk, tracing the Saturn system’s dynamical processes and history. We present close-range remote-sensing observations of the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s from the Cassini spacecraft. We find detailed sculpting of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s by embedded masses, and banded texture belts throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s. Saturn-orbiting streams of material impact the F <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>. There are fine-scaled correlations among optical depth, spectral properties, and temperature in the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>, but anticorrelations within strong density waves in the A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>. There is no spectral distinction between plateaux and the rest of the C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>, whereas the region outward of the Keeler gap is spectrally distinct from nearby regions. These results likely indicate that radial stratification of particle physical properties, rather than compositional differences, is responsible for producing these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> structures.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Capacity of Mitochondria in Microsporophylls May Function in Cycad Thermogenesis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> thermogenesis is a widespread phenomenon in cycads and may function to promote volatile emissions that affect pollinator behavior. Given their large population size and intense and durable heat-producing effects, cycads are important organisms for comprehensive studies of plant thermogenesis. However, knowledge of mitochondrial morphology and function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> thermogenesis is limited. Therefore, we investigated these mitochondrial properties in the thermogenic cycad species <i>Cycas revoluta</i>. Male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s generated heat even in cool weather conditions. Female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s produced heat, but to a lesser extent than male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s. Ultrastructural analyses of the two major tissues of male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s, microsporophylls and microsporangia, revealed the existence of a population of mitochondria with a distinct morphology in the microsporophylls. In these cells, we observed large mitochondria (cross-sectional area of 2 μm<sup>2</sup> or more) with a uniform matrix density that occupied >10% of the total mitochondrial volume. Despite the size difference, many nonlarge mitochondria (cross-sectional area <2 μm<sup>2</sup>) also exhibited a shape and a matrix density similar to those of large mitochondria. Alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and expression levels in microsporophylls were much higher than those in microsporangia. The <i>AOX</i> genes expressed in male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s revealed two different <i>AOX</i> complementary DNA sequences: <i>CrAOX1</i> and <i>CrAOX2</i>. The expression level of <i>CrAOX1</i> mRNA in the microsporophylls was 100 times greater than that of <i>CrAOX2</i> mRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that distinctive mitochondrial morphology and CrAOX1-mediated respiration in microsporophylls might play a role in cycad <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> thermogenesis.</p>

A Family of NAI2-Interacting Proteins in the Biogenesis of the ER Body and Related Structures
<p>Plants produce different types of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles that accumulate and transport proteins, lipids, and metabolites. In the Brassicales, a distinct ER-derived structure called the ER body is found throughout the epidermis of cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. NAI2 is a key factor for ER body formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Homologs of NAI2 are found only in the Brassicales and therefore may have evolved specifically to enable ER body formation. Here, we report that three related Arabidopsis NAI2-interacting proteins (NAIP1, NAIP2, and NAIP3) play a critical role in the biogenesis of ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es and related structures. Analysis using GFP fusions revealed that all three NAIPs are components of the ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es found in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. Genetic analysis with <i>naip</i> mutants indicates that they have a critical and redundant role in ER body formation. NAIP2 and NAIP3 are also components of other vesicular structures likely derived from the ER that are formed independent of NAI2 and are present not only in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots, but also in the rosettes. Thus, while NAIP1 is a specialized ER body component, NAIP2 and NAIP3 are components of different types of ER-derived structures. Analysis of chimeric NAIP proteins revealed that their N-terminal domains play a major role in the functional specialization between NAIP1 and NAIP3. Unlike NAI2, NAIPs have homologs in all plants; therefore, NAIP-containing ER structures, from which the ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es in the Brassicales may have evolved, are likely to be present widely in plants.</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> photoreceptor classes for colour vision, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> classes. Screening pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack screening pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> classes to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s are better suited than human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Genetic Interactions between PEROXIN12 and Other Peroxisome-Associated Ubiquitination Components
<p>Most eukaryotic cells require peroxisomes, organelles housing fatty acid β-oxidation and other critical metabolic reactions. Peroxisomal matrix proteins carry peroxisome-targeting signals that are recognized by one of two receptors, PEX5 or PEX7, in the cytosol. After delive<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> the matrix proteins to the organelle, these receptors are removed from the peroxisomal membrane or matrix. Receptor retrotranslocation not only facilitates further rounds of matrix protein import but also prevents deleterious PEX5 retention in the membrane. Three peroxisome-associated ubiquitin-protein ligases in the Really Interesting New Gene (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>) family, PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12, facilitate PEX5 retrotranslocation. However, the detailed mechanism of receptor retrotranslocation remains unclear in plants. We identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>pex12</i> Glu-to-Lys missense allele that conferred severe peroxisomal defects, including impaired β-oxidation, inefficient matrix protein import, and decreased growth. We compared this <i>pex12-1</i> mutant to other peroxisome-associated ubiquitination-related mutants and found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> peroxin mutants displayed elevated PEX5 and PEX7 levels, supporting the involvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> peroxins in receptor ubiquitination in Arabidopsis. Also, we observed that disruption of any Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> peroxin led to decreased PEX10 levels, as seen in yeast and mammals. Peroxisomal defects were exacerbated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> peroxin double mutants, suggesting distinct roles of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> peroxins. Finally, reducing function of the peroxisome-associated ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme PEX4 restored PEX10 levels and partially ameliorated the other molecular and physiological defects of the <i>pex12-1</i> mutant. Future biochemical analyses will be needed to determine whether destabilization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> peroxin complex observed in <i>pex12-1</i> stems from PEX4-dependent ubiquitination on the pex12-1 ectopic Lys residue.</p>

Thyroid hormone signaling specifies cone subtypes in human retinal organoids
<p>The mechanisms underlying specification of neuronal subtypes within the human nervous system are largely unknown. The blue (S), green (M), and red (L) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s of the retina enable high-acuity daytime and color vision. To determine the mechanism that controls S versus L/M fates, we studied the differentiation of human retinal organoids. Organoids and retinas have similar distributions, expression profiles, and morphologies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> subtypes. S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s are specified first, followed by L/M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s, and thyroid hormone signaling controls this temporal switch. Dynamic expression of thyroid hormone–degrading and –activating proteins within the retina ensures low signaling early to specify S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s and high signaling late to produce L/M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s. This work establishes organoids as a model for determining mechanisms of human development with promising utility for therapeutics and vision repair.</p>

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings
<p>Saturn has a sufficiently strong dipole magnetic field to trap high-energy charged particles and form radiation belts, which have been observed outside its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s. Whether stable radiation belts exist near the planet and inward of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s was previously unknown. The Cassini spacecraft’s Magneto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong> Imaging Instrument obtained measurements of a radiation belt that lies just above Saturn’s dense atmo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong> and is decoupled from the rest of the magneto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong> by the planet’s A- to C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s. The belt extends across the D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> and comprises protons produced through cosmic ray albedo neutron decay and multiple charge-exchange reactions. These protons are lost to atmospheric neutrals and D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> dust. Strong proton depletions that map onto features on the D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> indicate a highly structured and diverse dust environment near Saturn.</p>

Ecophysiological variables influencing Aleppo pine seed and cone production: a review
<p>The most interesting factors associated with seed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> production of Aleppo pine were largely reviewed to identify broad patterns and potential effectiveness of reforestation efforts and planning. Aleppo pine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> production and seed yields are relatively variable, with differences between spatial and temporal influences. These differences are considered, mainly between (i) year, (ii) stand characteristics and (iii) individual tree measurements. Annual variability among populations was recorded for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> production per tree, based on influencing factors such as genetic characteristics, wetness, nutrient availability, insect pests and disease. In addition, some factors may affect Aleppo pine tree growth directly but may be affecting seed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> production indirectly. Therefore, reduced stand density results in less competition among Aleppo pine trees and accompanying understory flora, which subsequently increases the stem diameter and other tree dimensions, including seed production. This review suggests that reforestation planning, particularly thinning, will result in improved tree morphology that will increase Aleppo pine seed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong> crops. Wildfire intensity and stand conditions such as light and soil nutrient status are also examined.</p>

Measurement and implications of Saturn’s gravity field and ring mass
<p>The interior structure of Saturn, the depth of its winds, and the mass and age of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s constrain its formation and evolution. In the final phase of the Cassini mission, the spacecraft dived between the planet and its innermost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>, at altitudes of 2600 to 3900 kilometers above the cloud tops. Du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> six of these crossings, a radio link with Earth was monitored to determine the gravitational field of the planet and the mass of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s.

The total mass of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s is (1.54 ± 0.49) × 10<sup>19</sup> kilograms (0.41 ± 0.13 times that of the moon Mimas), indicating that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s may have formed 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> years ago.</p>

Dust grains fall from Saturn’s D-ring into its equatorial upper atmosphere
<p>The sizes of Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> particles range from meters (boulders) to nanometers (dust). Determination of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s’ ages depends on loss processes, including the transport of dust into Saturn’s atmo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong>. Du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> the Grand Finale orbits of the Cassini spacecraft, its instruments measured tiny dust grains that compose the innermost D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> of Saturn. The nanometer-sized dust experiences collisions with exospheric (upper atmo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong>) hydrogen and molecular hydrogen, which forces it to fall from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> into the iono<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong> and lower atmo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong>. We used the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument to detect and characterize this dust transport and also found that diffusion dominates above and near the altitude of peak ionospheric density. This mechanism results in a mass deposition into the equatorial atmo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong> of ~5 kilograms per second, constraining the age of the D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>.</p>

High-temperature pairing in a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas
<p>The nature of the normal phase of strongly correlated fermionic systems is an outstanding question in quantum many-body physics. We used spatially resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure pai<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> energy of fermions across a wide range of temperatures and interaction strengths in a two-dimensional gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We observed many-body pai<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> at temperatures far above the critical temperature for superfluidity. In the strongly interacting regime, the pai<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> energy in the normal phase considerably exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pai<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> in this regime is driven by many-body correlations, rather than two-body physics. Our findings show that pai<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> correlations in strongly interacting two-dimensional fermionic systems are remarkably robust against thermal fluctuations.</p>

The formation of peak rings in large impact craters
<p>Large impacts provide a mechanism for resurfacing planets through mixing near-surface rocks with deeper material. Central peaks are formed from the dynamic uplift of rocks du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> crater formation. As crater size increases, central peaks transition to peak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s. Without samples, debate surrounds the mechanics of peak-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> formation and their depth of origin. Chicxulub is the only known impact structure on Earth with an unequivocal peak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>, but it is buried and only accessible through drilling.

The peak-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> rocks are cross-cut by dikes and shear zones and have an unusually low density and seismic velocity. Large impacts therefore generate vertical fluxes and increase porosity in planetary crust.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong> and soil, and co-occur<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occur<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>-porous species. Stomata of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>-porous oaks was less st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>ent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Maternal Huluwa dictates the embryonic body axis through β-catenin in vertebrates
<p>The vertebrate body is formed by cell movements and shape change du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> embryogenesis. It remains undetermined which maternal signals govern the formation of the dorsal organizer and the body axis. We found that maternal depletion of <i>huluwa</i>, a previously unnamed gene, causes loss of the dorsal organizer, the head, and the body axis in zebrafish and <i>Xenopus</i> embryos. Huluwa protein is found on the plasma membrane of blastomeres in the future dorsal region in early zebrafish blastulas. Huluwa has strong dorsalizing and secondary axis–inducing activities, which require β-catenin but can function independent of Wnt ligand/receptor signaling. Mechanistically, Huluwa binds to and promotes the tankyrase-mediated degradation of Axin. Therefore, maternal Huluwa is an essential determinant of the dorsal organizer and body axis in vertebrate embryos.</p>

“Perfect” designer chromosome V and behavior of a ring derivative
<p>Perfect matching of an assembled physical sequence to a specified designed sequence is crucial to verify design principles in genome synthesis. We designed and de novo synthesized 536,024–base pair chromosome synV in the “Build-A-Genome China” course. We corrected an initial isolate of synV to perfectly match the designed sequence using integrative cotransformation and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)–mediated editing in 22 steps; synV strains exhibit high fitness under a variety of culture conditions, compared with that of wild-type V strains. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> synV derivative was constructed, which is fully functional in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> under all conditions tested and exhibits lower spore viability du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> meiosis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> synV chromosome can extends Sc2.0 design principles and provides a model with which to study genomic rearrangement, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> chromosome evolution, and human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> chromosome disorders.</p>

Two- and three-body contacts in the unitary Bose gas
<p>In many-body systems governed by pairwise contact interactions, a wide range of observables is linked by a single parameter, the two-body contact, which quantifies two-particle correlations. This profound insight has transformed our understanding of strongly interacting Fermi gases. Using Ramsey interferometry, we studied coherent evolution of the resonantly interacting Bose gas, and we show here that it cannot be explained by only pairwise correlations. Our experiments reveal the crucial role of three-body correlations arising from Efimov physics and provide a direct measurement of the associated three-body contact.</p>

The TRPM2 channel is a hypothalamic heat sensor that limits fever and can drive hypothermia
<p>Body temperature homeostasis is critical for survival and requires precise regulation by the nervous system. The hypothalamus serves as the principal thermostat that detects and regulates internal temperature. We demonstrate that the ion channel TRPM2 [of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family] is a temperature sensor in a subpopulation of hypothalamic neurons. TRPM2 limits the fever response and may detect increased temperatures to prevent overheating. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation and inhibition of hypothalamic TRPM2-expressing neurons in vivo decreased and increased body temperature, respectively. Such manipulation may allow analysis of the beneficial effects of altered body temperature on diverse disease states. Identification of a functional role for TRP channels in monito<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> internal body temperature should promote further analysis of molecular mechanisms governing thermoregulation and foster the genetic dissection of hypothalamic circuits involved with temperature homeostasis.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
AtAIRP2 E3 Ligase Affects ABA and High-Salinity Responses by Stimulating Its ATP1/SDIRIP1 Substrate Turnover
<p>AtAIRP2 is a cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that positively regulates an abscisic acid (ABA) response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Yeast two-hybrid screening using AtAIRP2 as bait identified ATP1 (AtAIRP2 Target Protein1) as a substrate of AtAIRP2. ATP1 was found to be identical to SDIRIP1, which was reported recently to be a negative factor in ABA signaling and a target protein of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> E3 ligase SDIR1. Accordingly, ATP1 was renamed ATP1/SDIRIP1. A specific interaction between AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 and ubiquitination of ATP1/SDIRIP1 by AtAIRP2 were demonstrated in vitro and in planta. The turnover of ATP1/SDIRIP1 was regulated by AtAIRP2 in cell-free degradation and protoplast cotransfection assays. The ABA-mediated germination assay of <i>35S</i>:<i>ATP1/SDIRIP1-RNAi/atairp2</i> double mutant progeny revealed that ATP1/SDIRIP1 acts downstream of AtAIRP2. AtAIRP2 and SDIR1 reciprocally complemented the ABA- and salt-insensitive germination phenotypes of <i>sdir1</i> and <i>atairp2</i> mutants, respectively, indicating their combinatory roles in seed germination. Subcellular localization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments in the presence of MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, showed that AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 were colocalized to the cytosolic spherical body, which lies in close proximity to the nucleus, in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaf cells. The 26S proteasome subunits RPN12a and RPT1 and the molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSP101 were colocalized to these discrete punctae-like structures. These results raised the possibility that AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 interact in the cytosolic spherical compartment. Collectively, our data suggest that the down-regulation of ATP1/SDIRIP1 by AtAIRP2 and SDIR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> E3 ubiquitin ligases is critical for ABA and high-salinity responses du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> germination in Arabidopsis.</p>

The impact of external fixation on mortality in patients with an unstable pelvic ring fracture
<sec><title>Aim</title><p>There is not adequate evidence to establish whether external   fixation (EF) of pelvic fractures leads to a reduced mortality.   We used the Japan Trauma Data Bank database to identify isolated   unstable pelvic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> fractures to exclude the possibility of blood   loss from other injuries, and analyzed the effectiveness of EF on   mortality in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a registry-based comparison of 1163 patients who had   been treated for an isolated unstable pelvic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> fracture with   (386 patients) or without (777 patients) EF. An isolated pelvic   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> fracture was defined by an Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for   other injuries of < 3. An unstable pelvic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> fracture was defined   as having an AIS ≥ 4. The primary outcome of this study was mortality.   A subgroup analysis was carried out for patients who required blood   transfusion within 24 hours of arrival in the Emergency Department   and those who had massive blood loss (AIS code: 852610.5).

Development
The p21-activated kinase Mbt is a component of the apical protein complex in central brain neuroblasts and controls cell proliferation
<p>The final size of the central nervous system is determined by precisely controlled generation, proliferation and death of neural stem cells. We show here that the <i>Drosophila</i> PAK protein Mushroom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es tiny (Mbt) is expressed in central brain progenitor cells (neuroblasts) and becomes enriched to the apical cortex of neuroblasts in a cell cycle- and Cdc42-dependent manner. Using mushroom body neuroblasts as a model system, we demonstrate that in the absence of Mbt function, neuroblasts and their progeny are correctly specified and are able to generate different neuron subclasses as in the wild type, but are impaired in their proliferation activity throughout development. In general, loss of Mbt function does not interfere with establishment or maintenance of cell polarity, orientation of the mitotic spindle and organization of the actin or tubulin cytoskeleton in central brain neuroblasts. However, we show that <i>mbt</i> mutant neuroblasts are significantly reduced in cell size du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> different stages of development, which is most pronounced for mushroom body neuroblasts. This phenotype correlates with reduced mitotic activity throughout development. Additionally, postembryonic neuroblasts are lost prematurely owing to apoptosis. Yet, preventing apoptosis did not rescue the loss of neurons seen in the adult mushroom body of <i>mbt</i> mutants. From these results, we conclude that Mbt is part of a regulatory network that is required for neuroblast growth and thereby allows proper proliferation of neuroblasts throughout development.</p>

Ventricular Fibrillation Conversion Testing After Implantation of a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), subcutaneous (S)-ICDs require a higher energy for effective defibrillation. Although ventricular fibrillation conversion testing (CT) is recommended after S-ICD implantation to ensure an adequate margin between the defibrillation threshold and maximum device output (80J), prior work found that adherence to this recommendation is declining.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied first-time recipients of S-ICDs (between September 28, 2012, and April 1, 2016) in the National Cardiovascular Database Registry ICD Registry to determine predictors of use of CT, predictors of an insufficient safety margin (ISM, defined as ventricular fibrillation conversion energy >65J) du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> testing, and inhospital outcomes associated with use of CT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict use of CT and ISM.

Although deferral of CT was associated with several patient characteristics (including increased body mass index, increased body surface area, severely reduced ejection fraction, dialysis dependence, warfarin use, anemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), the facility effect was comparatively more important (area under the curve for patient level versus generalized linear mixed model: 0.619 versus 0.877). An ISM occurred in 6.9% (n=336) of 4864 patients without a prior ICD and was more common among white patients and those with ventricular pacing on the preimplant ECG, higher preimplant blood pressure, larger body surface area, higher body mass index, and lower ejection fraction. A risk score was able to identify patients at low (<5%), medium (5% to 10%), and high risk (>10%) for ISM.

Sex Differences and Similarities in Atrial Fibrillation Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Mortality in Community Cohorts

Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were observed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular risk factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime risk was similar (>30%) for both sexes. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold risk of death in comparison with those without AF. Multivariable-adjusted models showed sex differences for the association of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio per standard deviation increase, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.23 in women versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25–1.38 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.001). Total cholesterol was inversely associated with incident AF with a greater risk reduction in women (hazard ratio per SD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81–0.90 versus 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.97 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.023). No sex differences were seen for C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. The population-attributable risk of all risk factors combined was 41.9% in women and 46.0% in men. About 20% of the risk was observed for body mass index.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lifetime risk of AF was high, and AF was strongly associated with increased mortality both in women and men.

Protein kinase N3 promotes bone resorption by osteoclasts in response to Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling
<p>Cytoskeletal reorganization in osteoclasts to form actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s is necessary for these cells to attach to bone and resorb bone matrices. We delineated the pathway through which Wnt5a signaling through receptor tyrosine kinase–like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2) promoted the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts. Wnt5a binding to Ror2 stimulated Rho, a small GTPase involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. Subsequently, the Rho effector kinase Pkn3 bound to and enhanced the activity of c-Src, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is critical for actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> formation. Mice with an osteoclast-specific deficiency in <i>Ror2</i> (<i>Ror2</i><sup>ΔOcl/ΔOcl</sup>) had increased bone mass. Osteoclasts derived from these mice exhibited impaired bone resorption and actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> formation, defects that were rescued by overexpression of constitutively active RhoA. These osteoclasts also exhibited reduced interaction between c-Src and Pkn3 and reduced c-Src kinase activity. Similar to <i>Ror2</i><sup>ΔOcl/ΔOcl</sup> mice, mice with a global deficiency of <i>Pkn3</i> (<i>Pkn3</i><sup>−/−</sup>) had increased bone mass. The proline-rich region and kinase domain of Pkn3 were required to restore the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts derived from <i>Pkn3</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice. Thus, Pkn3 promotes bone resorption downstream of Wnt5a-Ror2-Rho signaling, and this pathway may be a therapeutic target for bone diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontal disease.</p>

Probing entanglement in a many-body–localized system
<p>An interacting quantum system that is subject to disorder may cease to thermalize owing to localization of its constituents, thereby marking the breakdown of thermodynamics. The key to understanding this phenomenon lies in the system’s entanglement, which is experimentally challenging to measure. We realize such a many-body–localized system in a disordered Bose-Hubbard chain and characterize its entanglement properties through particle fluctuations and correlations. We observe that the particles become localized, suppressing transport and preventing the thermalization of subsystems. Notably, we measure the development of nonlocal correlations, whose evolution is consistent with a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy, the hallmark of many-body localization. Our work experimentally establishes many-body localization as a qualitatively distinct phenomenon from localization in noninteracting, disordered systems.</p>

Catalytic palladium-oxyallyl cycloaddition
<p>Exploration of intermediates that enable chemoselective cycloaddition reactions and expeditious construction of fused- or bridged-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> systems is a continuous challenge for organic synthesis.

However, its potential to access five-membered skeletons is underdeveloped, largely due to the thermally forbidden (3+2) pathway. Here, the combination of a tailored precursor and a Pd(0) catalyst generates a Pd-oxyallyl intermediate that cyclizes with conjugated dienes to produce a diverse array of tetrahydrofuran skeletons. The cycloaddition overrides conventional (4+3) selectivity by proceeding through a stepwise pathway involving a Pd-allyl transfer and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> closure sequence. Subsequent treatment of the (3+2) adducts with a palladium catalyst converts the heterocycles to the carbocyclic cyclopentanones.</p>

Body size downgrading of mammals over the late Quaternary
<p>Since the late Pleistocene, large-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>ed mammals have been extirpated from much of Earth. Although all habitable continents once harbored giant mammals, the few remaining species are largely confined to Africa. This decline is coincident with the global expansion of hominins over the late Quaternary. Here, we quantify mammalian extinction selectivity, continental body size distributions, and taxonomic diversity over five time periods spanning the past 125,000 years and stretching approximately 200 years into the future. We demonstrate that size-selective extinction was already under way in the oldest interval and occurred on all continents, within all trophic modes, and across all time intervals. Moreover, the degree of selectivity was unprecedented in 65 million years of mammalian evolution. The distinctive selectivity signature implicates hominin activity as a primary driver of taxonomic losses and ecosystem homogenization. Because megafauna have a disproportionate influence on ecosystem structure and function, past and present body size downgrading is reshaping Earth’s bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong>.</p>

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

Nonreciprocity originates from unidirectional edge states at the boundary between photonic structures with distinct topological invariants.

The intestinal microbiota regulates body composition through NFIL<bold>3</bold> and the circadian clock
<p>The intestinal microbiota has been identified as an environmental factor that markedly affects energy storage and body-fat accumulation in mammals, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that the microbiota regulates body composition through the circadian transcription factor NFIL3. <i>Nfil3</i> transcription oscillates diurnally in intestinal epithelial cells, and the amplitude of the circadian oscillation is controlled by the microbiota through group 3 innate lymphoid cells, STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and the epithelial cell circadian clock. NFIL3 controls expression of a circadian lipid metabolic program and regulates lipid absorption and export in intestinal epithelial cells. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how the intestinal microbiota regulates body composition and establish NFIL3 as an essential molecular link among the microbiota, the circadian clock, and host metabolism.</p>

Ring attractor dynamics in the <i>Drosophila</i> central brain
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> attractors are a class of recurrent networks hypothesized to underlie the representation of heading direction. Such network structures, schematized as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> of neurons whose connectivity depends on their heading preferences, can sustain a bump-like activity pattern whose location can be updated by continuous shifts along either turn direction. We recently reported that a population of fly neurons represents the animal’s heading via bump-like activity dynamics.

A network with local excitation and global inhibition enforces this unique and persistent heading representation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> attractor networks have long been invoked in theoretical work; our study provides physiological evidence of their existence and functional architecture.</p>

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions
<p>HIV-1 contains a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>-shaped capsid encasing the viral genome. This capsid is thought to follow fullerene geometry—a curved hexameric lattice of the capsid protein, CA, closed by incorporating 12 CA pentamers. Current models for core structure are based on crystallography of hexameric and cross-linked pentameric CA, electron microscopy of tubular CA arrays, and simulations. Here, we report subnanometer-resolution cryo–electron tomography structures of hexameric and pentameric CA within intact HIV-1 particles. Whereas the hexamer structure is compatible with crystallography studies, the pentamer forms using different interfaces. Determining multiple structures revealed how CA flexes to form the variably curved core shell. We show that HIV-1 CA assembles both aberrant and perfect fullerene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cone</span></strong>s, supporting models in which conical cores assemble de novo after maturation.</p>

Formation of the Orientale lunar multiring basin
<p>Multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> basins, large impact craters characterized by multiple concentric topographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s, dominate the stratigraphy, tectonics, and crustal structure of the Moon. Using a hydrocode, we simulated the formation of the Orientale multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> basin, producing a subsurface structure consistent with high-resolution gravity data from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) spacecraft. The simulated impact produced a transient crater, ~390 kilometers in diameter, that was not maintained because of subsequent gravitational collapse. Our simulations indicate that the flow of warm weak material at depth was crucial to the formation of the basin’s outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s, which are large normal faults that formed at different times du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> the collapse stage. The key parameters controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> location and spacing are impactor diameter and lunar thermal gradients.</p>

Temporal Proteomics of Inducible RNAi Lines of Clp Protease Subunits Identifies Putative Protease Substrates
<p>The Clp protease in the chloroplasts of plant cells is a large complex composed of at least 13 nucleus-encoded subunits and one plastid-encoded subunit, which are arranged in several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>-like structures. The proteolytic P-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> and the structurally similar R-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> form the core complex that contains the proteolytic chamber. Chaperones of the HSP100 family help with substrate unfolding, and additional accessory proteins are believed to assist with Clp complex assembly and/or to promote complex stability. Although the structure and function of the Clp protease have been studied in great detail in both bacteria and chloroplasts, the identification of bona fide protease substrates has been very challenging. Knockout mutants of genes for protease subunits are of limited value, due to their often pleiotropic phenotypes and the difficulties with distinguishing primary effects (i.e. overaccumulation of proteins that represent genuine protease substrates) from secondary effects (proteins overaccumulating for other reasons). Here, we have developed a new strategy for the identification of candidate substrates of plant proteases. By combining ethanol-inducible knockdown of protease subunits with time-resolved analysis of changes in the proteome, proteins that respond immediately to reduced protease activity can be identified. In this way, secondary effects are minimized and putative protease substrates can be identified. We have applied this strategy to the Clp protease complex of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) and identified a set of chloroplast proteins that are likely degraded by Clp. These include several metabolic enzymes but also a small number of proteins involved in photosynthesis.</p>

Conserved Dynamics of Chloroplast Cytoskeletal FtsZ Proteins Across Photosynthetic Lineages
<p>The cytoskeletal Filamenting temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> is critical for cell division in bacteria and chloroplast division in photosynthetic eukaryotes. While bacterial FtsZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong>s are composed of a single FtsZ, except in the basal glaucophytes, chloroplast division involves two heteropolymer-forming FtsZ isoforms: FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 in the green lineage and FtsZA and FtsZB in red algae. FtsZ1 and FtsZB probably arose by duplication of the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively. We expressed fluorescent fusions of FtsZ from diverse photosynthetic organisms in a heterologous system to compare their intrinsic assembly and dynamic properties. FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments were morphologically distinct from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments. When coexpressed, FtsZ pairs from plants and algae colocalized, consistent with heteropolymerization. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that subunit exchange was greater from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments than from FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments and that FtsZ1 and FtsZB increased turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively, from heteropolymers. GTPase activity was essential only for turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments. Cyanobacterial and glaucophyte FtsZ properties mostly resembled those of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, though the glaucophyte protein exhibited some hybrid features. Our results demonstrate that the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA have retained functional attributes of their common FtsZ ancestor, while eukaryotic-specific FtsZ1 and FtsZB acquired new but similar dynamic properties, possibly through convergent evolution. Our findings suggest that the evolution of a second FtsZ that could copolymerize with the more ancestral form to enhance FtsZ-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> dynamics may have been essential for plastid evolution in the green and red photosynthetic lineages.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p>Drought stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced water availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in water-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to drought stress through its control of stomatal aperture and water transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the drought tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are controlled by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by drought stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved water use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a controlled drought-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the control of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel control point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

A viral aphrodisiac in the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i>
<p>We identified the insect iridovirus IIV-6/CrIV as a pathogen of the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i> using electron microscopy (EM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. EM showed that the virus attacks the fat body, an organ important for protein production, immune function and lipid storage. Du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> infection the fat body hypertrophied, but egg production withered, leaving the lateral oviducts empty of eggs; the females were effectively sterile. EM of the testis of infected males suggests that the testis was not invaded by the virus, although sperm taken from the spermatophores of infected males showed little or no motility. Nevertheless, males and females continued to mate when infected. In fact, infected males were quicker to court females than uninfected controls. The virus benefits from the continued sexual behaviour of its host; transmission studies show that the virus can be spread through sexual contact. Sickness behaviour, the adaptive reduction of feeding and sexual behaviour that is induced by an activated immune system, was absent in infected crickets. Total haemolymph protein was reduced, as was phenoloxidase activity, suggesting a reduction in immune protein production by the fat body. The evidence suggests that du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ring</span></strong> IIV-6/CrIV infection, the immune signal(s) that induces sickness behaviour is absent. Curtailment of a host's sickness behaviour may be necessary for any pathogen that is spread by host sexual behaviour.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bodi</span></strong>es such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the mechanism of generating water motion by mouth suction.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Effect of Distinct Lifestyle Interventions on Mobilization of Fat Storage Pools
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We aimed to assess whether distinct lifestyle strategies can differentially affect specific body adipose depots.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an 18-month randomized controlled trial among 278 sedentary adults with abdominal obesity (75%) or dyslipidemia in an isolated workplace with a monitored provided lunch. Participants were randomized to isocaloric low-fat or Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate (MED/LC) diet+28 g walnuts/day with/without added moderate physical activity (PA; 80% aerobic; supervised/free gym membership). Overall primary outcome was body fat redistribution, and the main specific end point was visceral adipose tissue (VAT). We further followed the dynamics of different fat depots (deep and superficial subcutaneous, liver, pericardial, muscle, pancreas, and renal sinus) by magnetic resonance imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 278 participants (age, 48 years, 89% men, body mass index, 30.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 86% completed the trial with good adherence. The low-fat group preferentially decreased reported fat intake (−21.0% versus −11.5% for the MED/LC; <i>P</i><0.001), and the MED/LC group decreased reported carbohydrates intake (−39.5% versus −21.3% for the low-fat group; <i>P</i><0.001). The PA<sup>+</sup> groups significantly increased the metabolic equivalents per week versus the PA<sup>−</sup> groups (19.0 versus 2.1; <i>P</i>=0.009). Whereas final moderate weight loss was indifferent, exercise attenuated the waist circumference rebound with the greatest effect in the MED/LC<sup>PA+</sup> group (<i>P</i><0.05). VAT (−22%), intrahepatic (−29%), and intrapericardial (−11%) fats declines were higher than pancreatic and femur intermuscular fats (1% to 2%) loss. Independent of weight loss, PA<sup>+</sup> with either diet had a significantly greater effect on decreasing VAT (mean of difference, −6.67cm<sup>2</sup>; 95% confidence interval, −14.8 to −0.45) compared with PA<sup>−</sup>. The MED/LC diet was superior to the low-fat diet in decreasing intrahepatic, intrapericardial, and pancreatic fats (<i>P</i><0.05 for all). In contrast, renal sinus and femoral intermuscular fats were not differentially altered by lifestyle interventions but by weight loss per se. In multivariate models further adjusted for weight loss, losing VAT or intrahepatic fat was independently associated with improved lipid profile, losing deep subcutaneous adipose tissue with improved insulin sensitivity, and losing superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue remained neutral except for an association with decreased leptin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Moderate weight loss alone inadequately reflects the significant lifestyle effects on atherogenic and diabetogenic fat depots. The MED/LC diet mobilizes specific ectopic fat depots, and exercise has an independent contribution to VAT loss. Fat depots exhibit diverse responsiveness and are differentially related to cardiometabolic markers. Distinct lifestyle protocols may uniquely induce fat mobilization from specific anatomic sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Elevated extracellular ATP and ADP levels are associated with cellular injury, inflammation, and thrombosis. Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (CD39), an enzyme expressed on the plasmalemma of leukocytes and endothelial cells, suppresses platelet activation and leukocyte infiltration by phosphohydrolyzing ATP/ADP.

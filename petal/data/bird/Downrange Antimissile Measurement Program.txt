Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e air samples from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with samples from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sensors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement proved to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field samples (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable sensors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the sensors’ methods enable accurate ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used different definitions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for misinterpretation of the   results. We compared the reliability and accuracy of five current   methods using plain radiographs (those of Lewinnek, Widmer, Liaw,   Pradhan, and Woo and Morrey) with CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements, using the same   definition and reference plane.

Intra- and inter-observer reliability were high for   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement of inclination and anteversion with all methods   on plain radiographs and CT scans. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of inclination on   plain radiographs were similar to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements using CT (p =   0.043).

Measurement of a superconducting qubit with a microwave photon counter
<p>Fast, high-fidelity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement is a key ingredient for quantum error correction. Conventional approaches to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement of superconducting qubits, involving linear amplification of a microwave probe tone followed by heterodyne detection at room temperature, do not scale well to large system sizes. We introduce an approach to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement based on a microwave photon counter demonstrating raw single-shot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement fidelity of 92%. Moreover, the intrinsic damping of the photon counter is used to extract the energy released by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement process, allowing repeated high-fidelity quantum nondemolition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements. Our scheme provides access to the classical outcome of projective quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement at the millikelvin stage and could form the basis for a scalable quantum-to-classical interface.</p>

Cash for carbon: A randomized trial of payments for ecosystem services to reduce deforestation
<p>We evaluated a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> of payments for ecosystem services in Uganda that offered forest-owning households annual payments of 70,000 Ugandan shillings per hectare if they conserved their forest. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> was implemented as a randomized controlled trial in 121 villages, 60 of which received the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in land area covered by trees, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by classifying high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that tree cover declined by 4.2% during the study period in treatment villages, compared to 9.1% in control villages. We found no evidence that enrollees shifted their deforestation to nearby land. We valued the delayed carbon dioxide emissions and found that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> benefit is 2.4 times as large as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> costs.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. Photosynthesis transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed. Reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net photosynthesis, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based risk factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates adult lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es. We assessed and compared the utility of a risk model based solely on nonlaboratory risk factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory risk factors plus lipids for predicting high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study) and followed into adulthood when cIMT was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed (mean follow-up, 23.4 years).

Spatial entanglement patterns and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in Bose-Einstein condensates
<p>Many-particle entanglement is a fundamental concept of quantum physics that still presents conceptual challenges. Although nonclassical states of atomic ensembles were used to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement precision in quantum metrology, the notion of entanglement in these systems was debated because the correlations among the indistinguishable atoms were witnessed by collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements only. Here, we use high-resolution imaging to directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the spin correlations between spatially separated parts of a spin-squeezed Bose-Einstein condensate. We observe entanglement that is strong enough for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering: We can predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement outcomes for noncommuting observables in one spatial region on the basis of corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements in another region with an inferred uncertainty product below the Heisenberg uncertainty bound. This method could be exploited for entanglement-enhanced imaging of electromagnetic field distributions and quantum information tasks.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of the Arabidopsis Replication Timing Program
<p>Eukaryotes use a temporally regulated process, known as the replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>, to ensure that their genomes are fully and accurately duplicated during S phase. Replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s are predictive of genomic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of chromatin organization. Although replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to genome sequence and chromatin structure. We used the thymidine analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the genome-wide replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified genomic regions that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and correlated these regions with genomic features and with data for chromatin state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis chromosome arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric regions replicate late. Early and mid-replicating regions are gene-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late regions are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of chromatin states across the different times is complex, with each replication time corresponding to a mixture of states. Early and mid-replicating sequences interact with each other and not with late sequences, but early regions are more accessible than mid regions. The replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite genomic organization with early/mid-replicating regions and late regions forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated largely by chromatin accessibility.</p>

In contrast to wild-type plants, <i>sog1</i> plants, which are defective in damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death, maintain the cell identities and stereotypical structure of the stem cell niche after irradiation, but these cells fail to undergo cell division, terminating root growth. We propose DNA damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death is employed by plants as a developmental response, contrasting with its role as an anticarcinogenic response in animals. This role in plants may have evolved to restore the growth of embryos after the accumulation of DNA damage in seeds.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

The validity and reproducibility of cross table radiographs compared with CT scans for the measurement of anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and validity   of cross table radiographs for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing the anteversion of the   acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to compare   it with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements using CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 29 patients who underwent THA between June 2010 and   January 2016 were included. There were 17 men and 12 women. Their   mean age was 43 years (26 to 65). Seven patients underwent a bilateral   procedure. Thus, 36 THAs were included in the study. Lateral radiographs   and CT scans were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later. The anteversion of the acetabular component was   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed using the method described by Woo and Morrey and the ischiolateral   method described by Pulos et al and these were compared with the   results obtained from CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean anteversion was 18.35° (3° to 38°) using Woo and Morrey’s   method, 51.45° (30° to 85°) using the ischiolateral method and 21.22°   (2° to 48°) using CT scans. The Pearson correlation coefficient   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method. There was a linear correlation between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements   using the ischiolateral method and those using CT scans. We derived   a simple linear equation between the value of the CT scan and that   of ischiolateral method to deduce the CT scan value from that of ischiolateral   method and <i>vice versa</i>. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anteversion of the acetabular component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed using both   plain radiographic methods was consistently valid with good interobserver   reproducibility, but the ischiolateral method which is independent   of pelvic tilt was more accurate. As CT is costly, associated with   a high dose of radiation and not readily available, the ischiolateral method   can be used for assessing the anteversion of the acetabular component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1006–11.</p></sec>

The diagnostic performance of radiographic criteria to detect aseptic acetabular component loosening after revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of radiographic   criteria to detect aseptic acetabular loosening after revision total   hip arthroplasty (THA).

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although age-associated changes in left ventricular diastolic function are well recognized, limited data exist characterizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es of diastolic function in older adults, including both reference ranges reflecting the older adult population and prognostically relevant values for incident heart failure (HF), as well as their associations with circulating biomarkers of HF risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among 5801 elderly participants in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; age range, 67–90 years; mean age, 76±5 years; 42% male; 21% black), we determined the continuous association of diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es (tissue Doppler imaging [TDI] e’, E/e’, and left atrial size) with concomitant N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and subsequent HF hospitalization or death. We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of diastolic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for diastolic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-based cut points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal diastolic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal diastolic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign.

Tree Physiology
Partitioning of vessel resistivity in three liana species
<p>Vessels with simple perforation plates, found in the majority of angiosperms, are considered the evolutionarily most advanced conduits, least impeding the xylem sap flow. Nevertheless, when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed, their hydraulic resistivity (<i>R</i>, i.e., inverse value of hydraulic conductivity) is significantly higher than resistivity predicted using Hagen–Poiseuille equation (<i>R</i><sub>HP</sub>). In our study we aimed (i) to quantify two basic components of the total vessel resistivity – vessel lumen resistivity and end wall resistivity, and (ii) to analyze how the variable inner diameter of the vessel along its longitudinal axis affects resistivity. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed flow rates through progressively shortened stems of hop (<i>Humulus lupulus</i> L.), grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), and clematis (<i>Clematis vitalba</i> L.) and used elastomer injection for identification of open vessels and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement of changing vessel inner diameters along its axis. The relative contribution of end wall resistivity to total vessel resistivity was 0.46 for hop, 0.55 for grapevine, and 0.30 for clematis. Vessel lumen resistivity calculated from our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements was substantially higher than theoretical resistivity – about 43% for hop, 58% for grapevine, and 52% for clematis. We identified variation in the vessel inner diameter as an important source of vessel resistivity. The coefficient of variation of vessel inner diameter was a good predictor for the increase of the ratio of integral <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> calculated from the mean value of inner vessel diameter. We discuss the fact that we dealt with the longest vessels in a given stem sample, which may lead to the overestimation of vessel lumen resistivity, which consequently precludes decision whether the variable vessel inner diameter explains fully the difference between vessel lumen resistivity and <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> we observed.</p>

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

Soliton microcomb range measurement
<p>Laser-based range <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement systems are important in many application areas, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, manufacturing, formation flying of satellites, and basic science. Coherent laser ranging systems using dual-frequency combs provide an unprecedented combination of long range, high precision, and fast update rate. We report dual-comb distance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement using chip-based soliton microcombs. A single pump laser was used to generate dual-frequency combs within a single microresonator as counterpropagating solitons. We demonstrated time-of-flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement with 200-nanometer precision at an averaging time of 500 milliseconds within a range ambiguity of 16 millimeters. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements at distances up to 25 meters with much lower precision were also performed. Our chip-based source is an important step toward miniature dual-comb laser ranging systems that are suitable for photonic integration.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite sensitive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital volume is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission volume, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case volume, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es were (1) process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study these associations with hospital volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-volume hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es than higher-volume hospitals. Higher hospital volume was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10).

High-Density Lipoprotein Subspecies Defined by Presence of Apolipoprotein C-III and Incident Coronary Heart Disease in Four Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The causal role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in cardioprotection has been questioned by genetic and randomized studies. Novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es that relate to HDL function may contribute new information to the prediction of cardiovascular risk. Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is a key regulator of lipoprotein metabolism. We investigated whether subspecies of HDL defined by apoC-III are associated with coronary heart disease (CHD).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used immunoaffinity chromatography to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the apoA-I concentrations of HDL that contains and lacks apoC-III in 2 prospective studies of adults free of CHD. In MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), 5657 participants (52% women, 52–72 years of age) were followed for risk of CHD from 2000 to 2002 through 2013. In a case-cohort study nested within the DCH study (Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health), 3642 participants (47% women, 51–64 years of age) were followed from 1994 to 1997 through 2010. Subsequently, we conducted a meta-analysis that combined these results with the previously published findings from 2 cohort studies that used similar laboratory methodology to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e lipoproteins, totaling 2997 incident cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>ApoC-III was found on 6% to 8% of apoA-I. The 2 HDL subspecies showed opposing associations, with risk of CHD in each of the individual cohorts and in the meta-analysis (<i>P</i> heterogeneity between the 2 subspecies <0.01). HDL that contains apoC-III was associated with a higher risk of CHD (pooled relative risk per standard deviation, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.18), whereas HDL that lacks apoC-III was associated with lower risk (relative risk, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.83). The relative risk for HDL lacking apoC-III was even more negative than the relative risk for total HDL (relative risk, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.87).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings from 4 prospective studies support the hypothesis that apoC-III may mark a subfraction of HDL that is associated with higher risk of CHD.

Multicellular Transcriptional Analysis of Mammalian Heart Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The inability of the adult mammalian heart to regenerate following injury represents a major barrier in cardiovascular medicine. In contrast, the neonatal mammalian heart retains a transient capacity for regeneration, which is lost shortly after birth. Defining the molecular mechanisms that govern regenerative capacity in the neonatal period remains a central goal in cardiac biology. Here, we assemble a transcriptomic framework of multiple cardiac cell populations during postnatal development and following injury, which enables comparative analyses of the regenerative (neonatal) versus nonregenerative (adult) state for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, leukocytes, and endothelial cells from infarcted and noninfarcted neonatal (P1) and adult (P56) mouse hearts were isolated by enzymatic dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting at day 3 following surgery. RNA sequencing was performed on these cell populations to generate the transcriptome of the major cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. To complement our transcriptomic data, we also surveyed the epigenetic landscape of cardiomyocytes during postnatal maturation by performing deep sequencing of accessible chromatin regions by using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin from purified mouse cardiomyocyte nuclei (P1, P14, and P56).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Profiling of cardiomyocyte and nonmyocyte transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s uncovered several injury-responsive genes across regenerative and nonregenerative time points. However, the majority of transcriptional changes in all cardiac cell types resulted from developmental maturation from neonatal stages to adulthood rather than activation of a distinct regeneration-specific gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>. Furthermore, adult leukocytes and fibroblasts were characterized by the expression of a proliferative gene expression network following infarction, which mirrored the neonatal state. In contrast, cardiomyocytes failed to reactivate the neonatal proliferative network following infarction, which was associated with loss of chromatin accessibility around cell cycle genes during postnatal maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work provides a comprehensive framework and transcriptional resource of multiple cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration.

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental questions remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol formation by using extensive laboratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of rates of nucleation involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, ions, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulations and a comparison with atmospheric observations show that nearly all nucleation throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addition to sulfuric acid. A considerable fraction of nucleation involves ions, but the relatively weak dependence on ion concentrations indicates that for the processes studied, variations in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleation in the present-day atmosphere.</p>

Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> across the Mesophyll-Bundle Sheath Cell Interface in a C<sub>4</sub> Plant with Genetically Reduced PEP Carboxylase Activity
<p>Phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), localized to the cytosol of the mesophyll cell, catalyzes the first carboxylation step of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used RNA interference to target the cytosolic photosynthetic PEPC isoform in <i>Setaria viridis</i> and isolated independent transformants with very low PEPC activities. These plants required high ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for growth, consistent with the essential role of PEPC in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The combination of estimating direct CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by the bundle sheath using gas-exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements and modeling C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis with low PEPC activity allowed the calculation of bundle sheath conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>) in the progeny of these plants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements made at a range of temperatures suggested no or negligible effect of temperature on <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> depending on the technique used to calculate <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. Anatomical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements revealed that plants with reduced PEPC activity had reduced cell wall thickness and increased plasmodesmata (PD) density at the mesophyll-bundle sheath (M-BS) cell interface, whereas we observed little difference in these parameters at the mesophyll-mesophyll cell interface. The increased PD density at the M-BS interface was largely driven by an increase in the number of PD pit fields (cluster of PDs) rather than an increase in PD per pit field or the size of pit fields. The correlation of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> with bundle sheath surface area per leaf area and PD area per M-BS area showed that these parameters and cell wall thickness are important determinants of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. It is intriguing to speculate that PD development is responsive to changes in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic flux.</p>

LTR_retriever: A Highly Accurate and Sensitive Program for Identification of Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons
<p>Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are prevalent in plant genomes. The identification of LTR-RTs is critical for achieving high-quality gene annotation. Based on the well-conserved structure, multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s were developed for the de novo identification of LTR-RTs; however, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s are associated with low specificity and high false discovery rates. Here, we report LTR_retriever, a multithreading-empowered Perl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> that identifies LTR-RTs and generates high-quality LTR libraries from genomic sequences. LTR_retriever demonstrated significant improvements by achieving high levels of sensitivity (91%), specificity (97%), accuracy (96%), and precision (90%) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). LTR_retriever is also compatible with long sequencing reads. With 40k self-corrected PacBio reads equivalent to 4.5× genome coverage in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the constructed LTR library showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. In addition to canonical LTR-RTs with 5′-TG…CA-3′ termini, LTR_retriever also identifies noncanonical LTR-RTs (non-TGCA), which have been largely ignored in genome-wide studies. We identified seven types of noncanonical LTRs from 42 out of 50 plant genomes. The majority of noncanonical LTRs are <i>Copia</i> elements, with which the LTR is four times shorter than that of other <i>Copia</i> elements, which may be a result of their target specificity. Strikingly, non-TGCA <i>Copia</i> elements are often located in genic regions and preferentially insert nearby or within genes, indicating their impact on the evolution of genes and their potential as mutagenesis tools.</p>

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct vegetative and zygotic wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

Optical Measurement of Stem Xylem Vulnerability
<p>The vulnerability of plant water transport tissues to a loss of function by cavitation during water stress is a key indicator of the survival capabilities of plant species during drought. Quantifying this important metric has been greatly advanced by noninvasive techniques that allow embolisms to be viewed directly in the vascular system. Here, we present a new method for evaluating the spatial and temporal propagation of embolizing bubbles in the stem xylem during imposed water stress. We demonstrate how the optical method, used previously in leaves, can be adapted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the xylem vulnerability of stems. Validation of the technique is carried out by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing the xylem vulnerability of 13 conifers and two short-vesseled angiosperms and comparing the results with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements made using the cavitron centrifuge method. Very close agreement between the two methods confirms the reliability of the new optical technique and opens the way to simple, efficient, and reliable assessment of stem vulnerability using standard flatbed scanners, cameras, or microscopes.</p>

Diversification of Root Hair Development Genes in Vascular Plants
<p>The molecular genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for root hair development has been studied intensively in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). To understand the extent to which this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> might operate in other plants, we conducted a large-scale comparative analysis of root hair development genes from diverse vascular plants, including eudicots, monocots, and a lycophyte. Combining phylogenetics and transcriptomics, we discovered conservation of a core set of root hair genes across all vascular plants, which may derive from an ancient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for unidirectional cell growth coopted for root hair development during vascular plant evolution. Interestingly, we also discovered preferential diversification in the structure and expression of root hair development genes, relative to other root hair- and root-expressed genes, among these species. These differences enabled the definition of sets of genes and gene functions that were acquired or lost in specific lineages during vascular plant evolution. In particular, we found substantial divergence in the structure and expression of genes used for root hair patterning, suggesting that the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not shared by other species. To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive view of gene expression in a single plant cell type across multiple species.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O<sub>2</sub> optode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its release.</p>

Heart rate as a predictor of metabolic rate in heterothermic bats
<p>While heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) has been used as an indicator of energy expenditure, quantitative data showing the relationship between these variables are only available for normothermic animals.

At rest, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of normothermic resting bats was negatively correlated with <i>T</i><sub>a</sub>, with maximum <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of 803 beats min<sup>−1</sup> (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>=5°C). During torpor, the relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>a</sub> was curvilinear, and at low <i>T</i><sub>sub</sub> (~6°C), <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> fell to a minimum average of 8 beats min<sup>−1</sup>. The minimum average values for both [Formula] and <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in torpor reported here were among the lowest recorded for bats. The relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and [Formula] was significant for both resting (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.64, <i>P</i><0.001) and torpid bats (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.84, <i>P</i><0.001), with no overlap between the two states.

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion pattern (optic flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of optic flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as optic flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant optic flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of optic flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

The limits of applicability of the sound exposure level (SEL) metric to temporal threshold shifts (TTS) in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>The influence of fatiguing sound level and duration on post-exposure temporary threshold shift (TTS) was investigated in two beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The fatiguing sound was half-octave noise with a center frequency of 22.5 kHz. TTS was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed at a test frequency of 32 kHz. Thresholds were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by recording rhythmic evoked potentials (the envelope following response) to a test series of short (eight cycles) tone pips with a pip rate of 1000 s<sup>−1</sup>. TTS increased approximately proportionally to the dB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of both sound pressure (sound pressure level, SPL) and duration of the fatiguing noise, as a product of these two variables. In particular, when the noise parameters varied in a manner that maintained the product of squared sound pressure and time (sound exposure level, SEL, which is equivalent to the overall noise energy) at a constant level, TTS was not constant. Keeping SEL constant, the highest TTS appeared at an intermediate ratio of SPL to sound duration and decreased at both higher and lower ratios. Multiplication (SPL multiplied by log duration) better described the experimental data than an equal-energy (equal SEL) model.

Arthroscopic decompression not recommended in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Rotator cuff tendinopathy has a multifactorial origin. Rejecting   the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning operative treatment   at initial presentation in the first line. Physiotherapy exercise   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>mes are the accepted first line treatment. The aim of this   study was to assess the long-term additional benefits of subacromial decompression   in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This randomised controlled trial of 140 patients (52 men, 88   women, mean age 47.1 years; 18 to 60) with rotator cuff tendinopathy   extended previous work up to a maximum of 13 years. The patients   were randomised into two treatment groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty   and a supervised exercise treatment and a similar supervised exercise   treatment alone. Self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS)   was the primary outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e. Secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es were disability,   working ability, pain at night, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire   score and the number of painful days during the three months preceding   the final assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 90 patients (64%) returned questionnaires at a mean   12 years after randomisation. On an intention-to-treat basis, both   treatment groups reached statistically significant improvement compared   with the initial VAS for pain, but there was no significant difference   between groups. The same was true in the secondary outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es.   Due to group changes, the results were also analysed per protocol:   operated or not. No significant differences between the groups were   found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The natural history of rotator cuff tendinopathy probably plays   a significant role in the results in the long-term. Even though   the patients who underwent operative treatment had a stronger belief   in recovery, which is likely to be surgical and the effect of placebo,   the exercise group obtained similar results. In the future, an optimum   exercise regime should be searched for, as the most clinically and   cost-effective conservative treatment for rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:799–805.</p></sec>

Spinopelvic mobility and acetabular component position for total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Posterior tilt of the pelvis with sitting provides biological   acetabular opening. Our goal was to study the post-operative interaction   of skeletal mobility and sagittal acetabular component position.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a radiographic study of 160 hips (151 patients) who   prospectively had lateral spinopelvic hip radiographs for skeletal   and implant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements. Intra-operative acetabular component position   was determined according to the pre-operative spinal mobility. Sagittal   implant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of ante-inclination and sacral acetabular angle were   used as surrogate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements for the risk of impingement, and   intra-operative acetabular component angles were compared with these.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Post-operatively, ante-inclination and sacral acetabular angles   were within normal range in 133 hips (83.1%). A total of seven hips   (4.4%) had pathological imbalance and were biologically or surgically   fused hips. In all, 23 of 24 hips had pre-operative dangerous spinal   imbalance corrected.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In all, 145 of 160 hips (90%) were considered safe from impingement.   Patients with highest risk are those with biological or surgical   spinal fusion; patients with dangerous spinal imbalance can be safe   with correct acetabular component position. The clinical relevance   of the study is that it correlates acetabular component position   to spinal pelvic mobility which provides guidelines for total hip   arthroplasty.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1   Supple A):37–45.</p></sec>

Impact of Bystander Automated External Defibrillator Use on Survival and Functional Outcomes in Shockable Observed Public Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable rhythms can be improved with early defibrillation. Although shockable OHCA accounts for only ≈25% of overall arrests, ≈60% of public OHCAs are shockable, offering the possibility of restoring thousands of individuals to full recovery with early defibrillation by bystanders. We sought to determine the association of bystander automated external defibrillator use with survival and functional outcomes in shockable observed public OHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium prospectively collected detailed information on all cardiac arrests at 9 regional centers. The exposures were shock administration by a bystander-applied automated external defibrillator in comparison with initial defibrillation by emergency medical services. The primary outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e was discharge with normal or near-normal (favorable) functional status defined as a modified Rankin Score ≤2. Survival to hospital discharge was the secondary outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 49 555 OHCAs, 4115 (8.3%) observed public OHCAs were analyzed, of which 2500 (60.8%) were shockable. A bystander shock was applied in 18.8% of the shockable arrests. Patients shocked by a bystander were significantly more likely to survive to discharge (66.5% versus 43.0%) and be discharged with favorable functional outcome (57.1% versus 32.7%) than patients initially shocked by emergency medical services. After adjusting for known predictors of outcome, the odds ratio associated with a bystander shock was 2.62 (95% confidence interval, 2.07–3.31) for survival to hospital discharge and 2.73 (95% confidence interval, 2.17–3.44) for discharge with favorable functional outcome. The benefit of bystander shock increased progressively as emergency medical services response time became longer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Bystander automated external defibrillator use before emergency medical services arrival in shockable observed public OHCA was associated with better survival and functional outcomes. Continued emphasis on public automated external defibrillator utilization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s may further improve outcomes of OHCA.</p></sec>

Exercise-Induced Changes in Glucose Metabolism Promote Physiological Cardiac Growth
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Exercise promotes metabolic remodeling in the heart, which is associated with physiological cardiac growth; however, it is not known whether or how physical activity–induced changes in cardiac metabolism cause myocardial remodeling. In this study, we tested whether exercise-mediated changes in cardiomyocyte glucose metabolism are important for physiological cardiac growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used radiometric, immunologic, metabolomic, and biochemical assays to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e changes in myocardial glucose metabolism in mice subjected to acute and chronic treadmill exercise. To assess the relevance of changes in glycolytic activity, we determined how cardiac-specific expression of mutant forms of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase affect cardiac structure, function, metabolism, and gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s relevant to cardiac remodeling. Metabolomic and transcriptomic screenings were used to identify metabolic pathways and gene sets regulated by glycolytic activity in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Exercise acutely decreased glucose utilization via glycolysis by modulating circulating substrates and reducing phosphofructokinase activity; however, in the recovered state following exercise adaptation, there was an increase in myocardial phosphofructokinase activity and glycolysis. In mice, cardiac-specific expression of a kinase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase transgene (Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice) lowered glycolytic rate and regulated the expression of genes known to promote cardiac growth. Hearts of Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice had larger myocytes, enhanced cardiac function, and higher capillary-to-myocyte ratios. Expression of phosphatase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase in the heart (Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> mice) increased glucose utilization and promoted a more pathological form of hypertrophy devoid of transcriptional activation of the physiological cardiac growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>. Modulation of phosphofructokinase activity was sufficient to regulate the glucose–fatty acid cycle in the heart; however, metabolic inflexibility caused by invariantly low or high phosphofructokinase activity caused modest mitochondrial damage. Transcriptomic analyses showed that glycolysis regulates the expression of key genes involved in cardiac metabolism and remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Exercise-induced decreases in glycolytic activity stimulate physiological cardiac remodeling, and metabolic flexibility is important for maintaining mitochondrial health in the heart.</p></sec>

Effect of Long-Term Metformin and Lifestyle in the Diabetes Prevention Program and Its Outcome Study on Coronary Artery Calcium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Despite the reduced incidence of coronary heart disease with intensive risk factor management, people with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes remain at increased coronary heart disease risk. Diabetes prevention interventions may be needed to reduce coronary heart disease risk. This approach was examined in the DPP (Diabetes Prevention Program) and the DPPOS (Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study), a long-term intervention study in 3234 subjects with prediabetes (mean±SD age, 64±10 years) that showed reduced diabetes risk with lifestyle and metformin compared with placebo over 3.2 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The DPPOS offered periodic group lifestyle sessions to all participants and continued metformin in the originally randomized metformin group. Subclinical atherosclerosis was assessed in 2029 participants with coronary artery calcium (CAC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements after an average of 14 years of follow-up. The CAC scores were analyzed continuously as CAC severity and categorically as CAC presence (CAC score >0) and reported separately in men and women.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were no CAC differences between lifestyle and placebo intervention groups in either sex. CAC severity and presence were significantly lower among men in the metformin versus the placebo group (age-adjusted mean CAC severity, 39.5 versus 66.9 Agatston units, <i>P</i>=0.04; CAC presence, 75% versus 84%, <i>P</i>=0.02), but no metformin effect was seen in women. In multivariate analysis, the metformin effect in men was not influenced by demographic, anthropometric, or metabolic factors; by the development of diabetes mellitus; or by use/nonuse of statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Metformin may protect against coronary atherosclerosis in prediabetes and early diabetes mellitus among men.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Prolonged, Uninterrupted Sedentary Behavior and Glycemic Biomarkers Among US Hispanic/Latino Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Excessive sedentary time is ubiquitous in developed nations and is associated with deleterious health outcomes. Few studies have examined whether the manner in which sedentary time is accrued (in short or long bouts) carries any clinical relevance. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of prolonged, uninterrupted sedentary behavior with glycemic biomarkers in a cohort of US Hispanic/Latino adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 12 083 participants from the HCHS/SOL (Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos), a population-based study of Hispanic/Latino adults 18 to 74 years of age. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and glycosylated hemoglobin were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed from a fasting blood sample, and 2-hour glucose was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed after an oral glucose tolerance test. Sedentary time was objectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with a hip-mounted accelerometer. Prolonged, uninterrupted sedentariness was expressed as mean sedentary bout length.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After adjustment for potential confounders and moderate to vigorous physical activity, longer sedentary bout duration was dose-dependently associated with increased homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (<i>P</i> for trend<0.001) and 2-hour glucose levels (<i>P</i> for trend=0.015). These associations were not independent of total sedentary time; however, a significant interaction between sedentary bout duration and total sedentary time was observed. Evaluation of the joint association of total sedentary time and sedentary bout duration showed that participants in the upper quartile for both sedentary characteristics (ie, high total sedentary time and high sedentary bout duration) had the highest levels of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (<i>P</i><0.001 versus low group for both sedentary characteristics) and 2-hour glucose (<i>P</i>=0.002 versus low group for both sedentary characteristics). High total sedentary time or high sedentary bout duration alone were not associated with differences in any glycemic biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Accruing sedentary time in prolonged, uninterrupted bouts may be deleteriously associated with biomarkers of glucose regulation.</p></sec>

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to characterize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be standardized to take account of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we evaluated the time course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–elevation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-risk (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–elevation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were performed: patients with ST-segment–elevation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were evaluated at all time points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR examinations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference MaR was assessed by contrast-multidetector computed tomography during the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed models were used to take account of repeated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation time in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, edema extent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to values <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR estimates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–elevation MI edema highlight the need for standardization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a time window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for standardization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

Structure of a eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel at near-atomic resolution
<p>Voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels are responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. They are associated with a variety of channelopathies and are targeted by multiple pharmaceutical drugs and natural toxins. Here, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a putative Na<sub>v</sub> channel from American <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cockroach</span></strong> (designated Na<sub>v</sub>PaS) at 3.8 angstrom resolution. The voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the four repeats exhibit distinct conformations. The entrance to the asymmetric selectivity filter vestibule is guarded by heavily glycosylated and disulfide bondâ€“stabilized extracellular loops. On the cytoplasmic side, a conserved amino-terminal domain is placed below VSD<sub>I</sub>, and a carboxy-terminal domain binds to the III-IV linker. The structure of Na<sub>v</sub>PaS establishes an important foundation for understanding function and disease mechanism of Na<sub>v</sub> and related voltage-gated calcium channels.</p>

Not flying blind: a comparative study of photoreceptor function in flying and non-flying cockroaches
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Comparison of photoreceptors of flying <i>Panchlora</i> and non-flying <i>Periplaneta</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cockroach</span></strong>es using imaging and electrophysiological methods reveals prominent differences, which are discussed in relation to the visual ecological paradigm developed for <i>Diptera</i>.</p>

Juvenile hormone signaling in short germ-band hemimetabolan embryos
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> As shown by depleting the mRNA levels of key elements of juvenile hormone signaling, juvenile hormone has relevant functions during embryo development in the German <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cockroach</span></strong>, a basal insect.</p>

The role of personality variation, plasticity and social facilitation in cockroach aggregation
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> We used the American <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cockroach</span></strong> to show that individuals displaying low behavioural plasticity entrain the behaviour of other individuals through social interactions and change the aggregation dynamics of the group.</p>

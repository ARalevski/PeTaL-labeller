Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although age-associated changes in left ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function are well recognized, limited data exist characterizing measures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function in older adults, including both reference ranges reflecting the older adult population and prognostically relevant values for incident heart failure (HF), as well as their associations with circulating biomarkers of HF risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among 5801 elderly participants in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; age range, 67–90 years; mean age, 76±5 years; 42% male; 21% black), we determined the continuous association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic measures (tissue Doppler imaging [TDI] e’, E/e’, and left atrial size) with concomitant N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and subsequent HF hospitalization or death. We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these measures using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each measure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-based cut points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal measures and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic measures were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign. The use of age-based normative values when considering an elderly population improves the risk discrimination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic measures for incident HF or death.</p></sec>

Experimentally Increasing Titin Compliance in a Novel Mouse Model Attenuates the Frank-Starling Mechanism But Has a Beneficial Effect on Diastole
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Experimentally upregulating compliant titins has been suggested as a therapeutic for lowering pathological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic stiffness levels. However, how increasing titin compliance impacts global cardiac function requires in-depth study. We investigate the effect of upregulating compliant titins in a novel mouse model with a genetically altered titin splicing factor; integrative approaches were used from intact cardiomyocyte mechanics to pressure-volume analysis and Doppler echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Compliant titins were upregulated through deletion of the RNA Recognition Motif of the splicing factor RBM20 (<i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup>mice). A genome-wide exon expression analysis and a candidate approach revealed that the phenotype is likely to be dominated by greatly increased lengths of titin’s spring elements. At both cardiomyocyte and left ventricular chamber levels, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic stiffness was reduced in heterozygous (+/−) <i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup>mice with a further reduction in homozygous (−/−) mice at only the intact myocyte level. Fibrosis was present in only −/− <i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup> hearts. The Frank-Starling Mechanism was reduced in a graded fashion in <i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup> mice, at both the cardiomyocyte and left ventricular chamber levels. Exercise tests revealed an increase in exercise capacity in +/− mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Titin is not only important in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic but also in systolic cardiac function. Upregulating compliant titins reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic chamber stiffness owing to the increased compliance of myocytes, but it depresses end-systolic elastance; under conditions of exercise, the beneficial effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function dominate. Therapeutic manipulation of the RBM20-based splicing system might be able to minimize effects on fibrosis and systolic function while improving the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function in patients with heart failure.</p></sec>

Heart Failure Stages Among Older Adults in the Community
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects older adults, little data exist regarding the prevalence of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF stages among older individuals in the community. Additionally, the role of contemporary measures of longitudinal strain and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic dysfunction in defining HF stages is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HF stages were classified in 6118 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (67–91 years of age) at the fifth study visit as follows: A (asymptomatic with HF risk factors but no cardiac structural or functional abnormalities), B (asymptomatic with structural abnormalities, defined as left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or dysfunction, or significant valvular disease), C1 (clinical HF without prior hospitalization), and C2 (clinical HF with earlier hospitalization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using the traditional definitions of HF stages, only 5% of examined participants were free of HF risk factors or structural heart disease (Stage 0), 52% were categorized as Stage A, 30% Stage B, 7% Stage C1, and 6% Stage C2. Worse HF stage was associated with a greater risk of incident HF hospitalization or death at a median follow-up of 608 days. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the sample from Stage A to B and improved the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV structure, systolic function (based on LV ejection fraction and longitudinal strain), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with risk of incident HF hospitalization or death in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at risk for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based samples. LV ejection fraction is robustly preserved in at least two-thirds of older adults with prevalent HF (Stage C), highlighting the burden of HF with preserved LV ejection fraction in the elderly. LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function and longitudinal strain provide incremental prognostic value beyond conventional measures of LV structure and LV ejection fraction in identifying persons at risk for HF hospitalization or death.</p></sec>

Effect of Childhood Obesity Prevention Programs on Blood Pressure
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Childhood overweight and obesity are associated with elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e (BP). However, little is known about how childhood obesity lifestyle prevention programs affect BP. We assessed the effects of childhood obesity prevention programs on BP in children in developed countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We searched databases up to April 22, 2013, for relevant randomized, controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and natural experiments. Studies were included if they applied a diet or physical activity intervention(s) and were followed for ≥1 year (or ≥6 months for school-based intervention studies); they were excluded if they targeted only overweight/obese subjects or those with a medical condition. In our meta-analysis, intervention effects were calculated for systolic BP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP with the use of weighted random-effects models. Of the 23 included intervention studies (involving 18 925 participants), 21 involved a school setting. Our meta-analysis included 19 studies reporting on systolic BP and 18 on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP. The pooled intervention effect was −1.64 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −2.56 to −0.71; <i>P</i>=0.001) for systolic BP and −1.44 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −2.28 to −0.60; <i>P</i>=0.001) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP. The combined diet and physical activity interventions led to a significantly greater reduction in both systolic BP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP than the diet-only or physical activity–only intervention. Thirteen interventions (46%) had a similar effect on both adiposity-related outcomes and BP, whereas 11 interventions (39%) showed a significant desirable effect on BP but not on adiposity-related outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Obesity prevention programs have a moderate effect on reducing BP, and those targeting both diet and physical activity seem to be more effective.</p></sec>

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. The development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention control (control; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by curve fit of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic pressure-volume curve. Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) was measured to quantify changes in fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; control: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in controls (group×time <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic volume (group×time <i>P</i><0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was unchanged, providing greater stroke volume for any given filling pressure (loading×group×time <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and decreased cardiac stiffness. Regular exercise training may provide protection against the future risk of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction by preventing the increase in cardiac stiffness attributable to sedentary aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

High-Intensity Interval Training in Patients With Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Small studies have suggested that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is superior to moderate continuous training (MCT) in reversing cardiac remodeling and increasing aerobic capacity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The present multicenter trial compared 12 weeks of supervised interventions of HIIT, MCT, or a recommendation of regular exercise (RRE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Two hundred sixty-one patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% and New York Heart Association class II to III were randomly assigned to HIIT at 90% to 95% of maximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heart rat</span></strong>e, MCT at 60% to 70% of maximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heart rat</span></strong>e, or RRE. Thereafter, patients were encouraged to continue exercising on their own. Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, after the intervention, and at follow-up after 52 weeks. Primary end point was a between-group comparison of change in left ventricular end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic diameter from baseline to 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Groups did not differ in age (median, 60 years), sex (19% women), ischemic pathogenesis (59%), or medication. Change in left ventricular end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic diameter from baseline to 12 weeks was not different between HIIT and MCT (<i>P</i>=0.45); left ventricular end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic diameter changes compared with RRE were −2.8 mm (−5.2 to −0.4 mm; <i>P</i>=0.02) in HIIT and −1.2 mm (−3.6 to 1.2 mm; <i>P</i>=0.34) in MCT. There was also no difference between HIIT and MCT in peak oxygen uptake (<i>P</i>=0.70), but both were superior to RRE. However, none of these changes was maintained at follow-up after 52 weeks. Serious adverse events were not statistically different during supervised intervention or at follow-up at 52 weeks (HIIT, 39%; MCT, 25%; RRE, 34%; <i>P</i>=0.16). Training records showed that 51% of patients exercised below prescribed target during supervised HIIT and 80% above target in MCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>HIIT was not superior to MCT in changing left ventricular remodeling or aerobic capacity, and its feasibility remains unresolved in patients with heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Association Between Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Blood Pressure Among Adults in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of sodium and lower levels of potassium intake are associated with higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e. However, the shape and magnitude of these associations can vary by study participant characteristics or intake assessment method. Twenty-four–hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium are unaffected by recall errors and represent all sources of intake, and were collected for the first time in a nationally representative US survey. Our objective was to assess the associations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e and hypertension with 24-hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium among US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cross-sectional data were obtained from 766 participants age 20 to 69 years with complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e and 24-hour urine collections in the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the US noninstitutionalized population.

Day-to-Day Blood Pressure Variability and Risk of Dementia in a General Japanese Elderly Population

However, no studies have investigated the association of day-to-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e variability assessed by home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e measurement with the development of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 1674 community-dwelling Japanese elderly without dementia, ≥60 years of age, were followed up for 5 years (2007–2012). Home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e was measured 3 times every morning for a median of 28 days. Day-to-day systolic (SBP) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e variabilities, calculated as coefficients of variation (CoV) of home SBP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e, were categorized into quartiles. The hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of the CoV levels of home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e on the development of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia (VaD), and Alzheimer disease (AD) were computed with a Cox proportional hazards model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the follow-up, 194 subjects developed all-cause dementia; of these, 47 had VaD and 134 had AD. The age- and sex-adjusted incidences of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD increased significantly with increasing CoV levels of home SBP (all <i>P</i> for trend <0.05). These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including home SBP.

Delayed Repolarization Underlies Ventricular Arrhythmias in Rats With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents approximately half of heart failure, and its incidence continues to increase. The leading cause of mortality in HFpEF is sudden death, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) from 7 weeks of age to induce HFpEF (n=38). Rats fed a normal-salt diet (0.3% NaCl) served as controls (n=13). Echocardiograms were performed to assess systolic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function from 14 weeks of age. HFpEF-verified and control rats underwent programmed electrical stimulation. Corrected QT interval was measured by surface ECG. The mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) were probed by optical mapping, whole-cell patch clamp to measure action potential duration and ionic currents, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to investigate changes in ion channel expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After 7 weeks of a high-salt diet, 31 of 38 rats showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction along with signs of heart failure and hence were diagnosed with HFpEF. Programmed electric stimulation demonstrated increased susceptibility to VA in HFpEF rats (<i>P</i><0.001 versus controls). The arrhythmogenicity index was increased (<i>P</i><0.001) and the corrected QT interval on ECG was prolonged (<i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF rats. Optical mapping of HFpEF hearts demonstrated prolonged action potentials (<i>P</i><0.05) and multiple reentry circuits during induced VA. Single-cell recordings of cardiomyocytes isolated from HFpEF rats confirmed a delay of repolarization (<i>P</i>=0.001) and revealed downregulation of transient outward potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>; <i>P</i><0.05). The rapid components of the delayed rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>Kr</sub>) and the inward rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>K1</sub>) were also downregulated (<i>P</i><0.05), but the current densities were much lower than for <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>. In accordance with the reduction of <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>, both <i>Kcnd3</i> transcript and Kv4.3 protein levels were decreased in HFpEF rat hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Susceptibility to VA was markedly increased in rats with HFpEF. Underlying abnormalities include QT prolongation, delayed repolarization from downregulation of potassium currents, and multiple reentry circuits during VA. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that potassium current downregulation leads to abnormal repolarization in HFpEF, which in turn predisposes to VA and sudden cardiac death.</p></sec>

Immediate and Midterm Cardiac Remodeling After Surgical Pulmonary Valve Replacement in Adults With Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot provides symptomatic benefit and right ventricular (RV) volume reduction. However, data on the rate of ventricular structural and functional adaptation are scarce. We aimed to assess immediate and midterm post-PVR changes and predictors of reverse remoeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Fifty-seven patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (age ≥16 y; mean age, 35.8±10.1 y; 38 male) undergoing PVR were prospectively recruited for cardiovascular magnetic resonance performed before PVR (pPVR), immediately after PVR (median, 6 d), and midterm after PVR (mPVR; median, 3 y).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were immediate and midterm reductions in indexed RV end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic volumes and RV end-systolic volumes (RVESVi) (indexed RV end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic volume pPVR versus immediately after PVR versus mPVR, 156.1±41.9 versus 104.9±28.4 versus 104.2±34.4 mL/m<sup>2</sup>; RVESVi pPVR versus immediately after PVR versus mPVR, 74.9±26.2 versus 57.4±22.7 versus 50.5±21.7 mL/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.01). Normal postoperative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic and systolic RV volumes (the primary end point) achieved in 70% of patients were predicted by a preoperative indexed RV end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic volume ≤158 mL/m<sup>2</sup> and RVESVi ≤82 mL/m<sup>2</sup>. RVESVi showed a progressive decrease from baseline to immediate to midterm follow-up, indicating ongoing intrinsic RV functional improvement after PVR. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved (pPVR versus mPVR, 59.4±7.6% versus 61.9±6.8%; <i>P</i><0.01), and right atrial reverse remodeling occurred (pPVR versus mPVR, 15.2±3.4 versus 13.8±3.6 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.01). Larger preoperative RV outflow tract scar was associated with a smaller improvement in post-PVR RV/left ventricular ejection fraction. RV ejection fraction and peak oxygen uptake predicted mortality (<i>P</i>=0.03) over a median of 9.5 years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant right heart structural reverse remodeling takes place immediately after PVR, followed by a continuing process of further biological remodeling manifested by further reduction in RVESVi. PVR before RVESVi reaches 82 mL/m<sup>2</sup> confers optimal chances of normalization of RV function.</p></sec>

The distributions of CBP, mean awake ABP (aABP), and the CBP−aABP difference in the full sample and by demographic characteristics were compared. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing was used to model the relationship of the BP measures to age and body mass index. The prevalence of discrepancies in ABP- versus CBP-defined hypertension status—white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension—were also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Average systolic/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic aABP (123.0/77.4±10.3/7.4 mm Hg) was significantly higher than the average of 9 CBP readings over 3 visits (116.0/75.4±11.6/7.7 mm Hg). aABP exceeded CBP by >10 mm Hg much more frequently than CBP exceeded aABP. The difference (aABP>CBP) was most pronounced in young adults and those with normal body mass index. The systolic difference progressively diminished, but did not disappear, at older ages and higher body mass indexes. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic difference vanished around age 65 and reversed (CBP>aABP) for body mass index >32.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Whereas 5.3% of participants were hypertensive by CBP, 19.2% were hypertensive by aABP; 15.7% of those with nonelevated CBP had masked hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Contrary to a widely held belief, based primarily on cohort studies of patients with elevated CBP, ABP is not usually lower than CBP, at least not among healthy, employed individuals. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of otherwise healthy individuals with nonelevated CBP have masked hypertension. Demonstrated CBP−aABP gradients, if confirmed in representative samples (eg, NHANES [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]), could provide guidance for primary care physicians as to when, for a given CBP, 24-hour ABP would be useful to identify or rule out masked hypertension.</p></sec>

A coupled-clock system drives the automaticity of human sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells
<p>The spontaneous rhythmic action potentials generated by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker in the heart, dictate the regular and optimal cardiac contractions that pump blood around the body. Although the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heart rat</span></strong>e of humans is substantially slower than that of smaller experimental animals, current perspectives on the biophysical mechanisms underlying the automaticity of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells (SANCs) have been gleaned largely from studies of animal hearts. Using human SANCs, we demonstrated that spontaneous rhythmic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases generated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> clock were coupled to electrogenic surface membrane molecules (the M clock) to trigger rhythmic action potentials, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup>–cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling regulated clock coupling. When these clocks became uncoupled, SANCs failed to generate spontaneous action potentials, showing a depolarized membrane potential and disorganized local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases that failed to activate the M clock. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, which increases cAMP concentrations and clock coupling in other species, restored spontaneous, rhythmic action potentials in some nonbeating “arrested” human SANCs by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and synchronizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases. When β-AR stimulation was withdrawn, the clocks again became uncoupled, and SANCs reverted to a nonbeating arrested state. Thus, automaticity of human pacemaker cells is driven by a coupled-clock system driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling. Extreme clock uncoupling led to failure of spontaneous action potential generation, which was restored by recoupling of the clocks. Clock coupling and action potential firing in some of these arrested cells can be restored by β-AR stimulation–induced augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling.</p>

Genetic Predisposition to High Blood Pressure and Lifestyle Factors
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Both heritable and lifestyle risk factors contribute to elevated BP levels. We aimed to investigate the extent to which lifestyle factors could offset the effect of an adverse BP genetic profile and its effect on CVD risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We constructed a genetic risk score for high BP by using 314 published BP loci in 277 005 individuals without previous CVD from the UK Biobank study, a prospective cohort of individuals aged 40 to 69 years, with a median of 6.11 years of follow-up. We scored participants according to their lifestyle factors including body mass index, healthy diet, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol consumption, smoking, and urinary sodium excretion levels measured at recruitment. We examined the association between tertiles of genetic risk and tertiles of lifestyle score with BP levels and incident CVD by using linear regression and Cox regression models, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Healthy lifestyle score was strongly associated with BP (<i>P</i><10<sup>–320</sup>) for systolic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP and CVD events regardless of the underlying BP genetic risk. Participants with a favorable in comparison with an unfavorable lifestyle (bottom versus top tertile lifestyle score) had 3.6, 3.5, and 3.6 mm Hg lower systolic BP in low, middle, and high genetic risk groups, respectively (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.0006). Similarly, favorable in comparison with unfavorable lifestyle showed 30%, 31%, and 33% lower risk of CVD among participants in low, middle, and high genetic risk groups, respectively (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.99).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data further support population-wide efforts to lower BP in the population via lifestyle modification. The advantages and disadvantages of disclosing genetic predisposition to high BP for risk stratification needs careful evaluation.</p></sec>

Status of Hypertension in China
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although the prevalence of hypertension (HTN) continues to increase in developing countries, including China, recent data are lacking. A nationwide survey was conducted from October 2012 to December 2015 to assess the prevalence of HTN in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A stratified multistage random sampling method was used to obtain a nationally representative sample of 451 755 residents ≥18 years of age from 31 provinces in mainland China from October 2012 to December 2015. Blood pressure (BP) was measured after resting for 5 minutes by trained staff using a validated oscillometric BP monitor. HTN was defined as systolic BP (SBP) ≥140 mm Hg/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP (DBP) ≥90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication within 2 weeks. Pre-HTN was defined as SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg and DBP 80 to 89 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication. HTN control was defined as SBP <140 mm Hg and DBP<90 mm Hg. In addition, the prevalence of HTN (SBP ≥130 or DBP ≥80 mm Hg) and control rate (SBP <130 and DBP <80 mm Hg) of HTN were also estimated according to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association High Blood Pressure Guideline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 23.2% (≈244.5 million) of the Chinese adult population ≥18 years of age had HTN, and another 41.3% (≈435.3 million) had pre-HTN according to the Chinese guideline.

However, evidence-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e targets during pediatric CPR remain an important knowledge gap for CPR guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All children ≥37 weeks’ gestation and <19 years old in Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network intensive care units with chest compressions for ≥1 minute and invasive arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e monitoring before and during CPR between July 1, 2013, and June 31, 2016, were included. Mean DBP during CPR and Utstein-style standardized cardiac arrest data were collected. The hypothesis was that DBP ≥25 mm Hg during CPR in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old would be associated with survival. Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurological outcome, defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Categories 1 to 3 or no worse than prearrest baseline. Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error estimates were used to estimate the relative risk of outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded investigators analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e waveforms during CPR from 164 children, including 60% <1 year old, 60% with congenital heart disease, and 54% after cardiac surgery. The immediate cause of arrest was hypotension in 67%, respiratory decompensation in 44%, and arrhythmia in 19%. Median duration of CPR was 8 minutes (quartiles, 3 and 27 minutes). Ninety percent survived the event, 68% with return of spontaneous circulation and 22% by extracorporeal life support. Forty-seven percent survived to hospital discharge, and 43% survived to discharge with favorable neurological outcome.

Incident Cardiovascular Disease Among Adults With Blood Pressure <140/90 mm Hg

Over the past several decades, BP has declined and hypertension control has improved.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We estimated the percentage of incident CVD events that occur at SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg in a pooled analysis of 3 contemporary US cohorts: the REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke), the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), and the JHS (Jackson Heart Study) (n=31 856; REGARDS=21 208; MESA=6779; JHS=3869). Baseline study visits were conducted in 2003 to 2007 for REGARDS, 2000 to 2002 for MESA, and 2000 to 2004 for JHS. BP was measured by trained staff using standardized methods. Antihypertensive medication use was self-reported. The primary outcome was incident CVD, defined by the first occurrence of fatal or nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, or heart failure. Events were adjudicated in each study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Over a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, 2584 participants had incident CVD events.

Physiology of Angina and Its Alleviation With Nitroglycerin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms governing exercise-induced angina and its alleviation by the most commonly used antianginal drug, nitroglycerin, are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a method by which the effects of antianginal drugs could be evaluated invasively during physiological exercise to gain further understanding of the clinical impact of angina and nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty patients (mean age, 65.2±7.6 years) with exertional angina and coronary artery disease underwent cardiac catheterization via radial access and performed incremental exercise using a supine cycle ergometer. As they developed limiting angina, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered to half the patients, and all patients continued to exercise for 2 minutes at the same workload. Throughout exercise, distal coronary pressure and flow velocity and central aortic pressure were recorded with sensor wires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients continued to exercise after nitroglycerin administration with less ST-segment depression (<i>P</i>=0.003) and therefore myocardial ischemia. Significant reductions in afterload (aortic pressure, <i>P</i>=0.030) and myocardial oxygen demand were seen (tension-time index, <i>P</i>=0.024; rate-pressure product, <i>P</i>=0.046), as well as an increase in myocardial oxygen supply (Buckberg index, <i>P</i>=0.017). Exercise reduced peripheral arterial wave reflection (<i>P</i><0.05), which was not further augmented by the administration of nitroglycerin (<i>P</i>=0.648). The observed increases in coronary pressure gradient, stenosis resistance, and flow velocity did not reach statistical significance; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic velocity–pressure gradient relation was consistent with a significant increase in relative stenosis severity (k coefficient, <i>P</i><0.0001), in keeping with exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments and dilatation of normal segments, with trends toward reversal with nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The catheterization laboratory protocol provides a model to study myocardial ischemia and the actions of novel and established antianginal drugs. Administration of nitroglycerin causes changes in the systemic and coronary circulation that combine to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and to increase supply, thereby attenuating exercise-induced ischemia. Designing antianginal therapies that exploit these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec>

Human cell modeling demonstrated reduced expression from the mutant <i>MYBPHL</i> allele. Echocardiography of <i>Mybphl</i> heterozygous and null mouse hearts exhibited a 36% reduction in fractional shortening and an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic ventricular chamber size. Atria weight normalized to total heart weight was significantly increased in <i>Mybphl</i> heterozygous and null mice. Using a reporter system, we detected robust expression of <i>Mybphl</i> in the atria, and in discrete puncta throughout the right ventricular wall and septum, as well.

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart disease, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

Thresholds for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Among African Americans in the Jackson Heart Study
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ambulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e (BP) monitoring is the reference standard for out-of-clinic BP measurement. Thresholds for identifying ambulatory hypertension (daytime systolic BP [SBP]/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP [DBP] ≥135/85 mm Hg, 24-hour SBP/DBP ≥130/80 mm Hg, and nighttime SBP/DBP ≥120/70 mm Hg) have been derived from European, Asian, and South American populations. We determined BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension in a US population-based sample of African American adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed data from the Jackson Heart Study, a population-based cohort study comprised exclusively of African American adults (n=5306). Analyses were restricted to 1016 participants who completed ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline in 2000 to 2004. Mean SBP and DBP levels were calculated for daytime (10:00 am–8:00 pm), 24-hour (all available readings), and nighttime (midnight–6:00 am) periods, separately. Daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension were identified using regression- and outcome-derived approaches. The composite of a cardiovascular disease or an all-cause mortality event was used in the outcome-derived approach. For this latter approach, BP thresholds were identified only for SBP because clinic DBP was not associated with the outcome. Analyses were stratified by antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among participants not taking antihypertensive medication, the regression-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP/DBP corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP of 140/90 mm Hg were 134/85 mm Hg, 130/81 mm Hg, and 123/73 mm Hg, respectively. The outcome-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP corresponding to a clinic SBP ≥140 mm Hg were 138 mm Hg, 134 mm Hg, and 129 mm Hg, respectively. Among participants taking antihypertensive medication, the regression-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP/DBP corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP of 140/90 mm Hg were 135/85 mm Hg, 133/82 mm Hg, and 128/76 mm Hg, respectively. The corresponding outcome-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP were 140 mm Hg, 137 mm Hg, and 133 mm Hg, respectively, among those taking antihypertensive medication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>On the basis of the outcome-derived approach for SBP and regression-derived approach for DBP, the following definitions for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime hypertension corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mm Hg are proposed for African American adults: daytime SBP/DBP ≥140/85 mm Hg, 24-hour SBP/DBP ≥135/80 mm Hg, and nighttime SBP/DBP ≥130/75 mm Hg, respectively.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Toxicity of Illicit Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Use
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Millions of individuals have used illicit anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), but the long-term cardiovascular associations of these drugs remain incompletely understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using a cross-sectional cohort design, we recruited 140 experienced male weightlifters 34 to 54 years of age, comprising 86 men reporting ≥2 years of cumulative lifetime AAS use and 54 nonusing men. Using transthoracic echocardiography and coronary computed tomography angiography, we assessed 3 primary outcome measures: left ventricular (LV) systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction), LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function (early relaxation velocity), and coronary atherosclerosis (coronary artery plaque volume).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with nonusers, AAS users demonstrated relatively reduced LV systolic function (mean±SD left ventricular ejection fraction = 52±11% versus 63±8%; <i>P</i><0.001) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function (early relaxation velocity = 9.3±2.4 cm/second versus 11.1±2.0 cm/second; <i>P</i><0.001). Users currently taking AAS at the time of evaluation (N=58) showed significantly reduced LV systolic (left ventricular ejection fraction = 49±10% versus 58±10%; <i>P</i><0.001) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function (early relaxation velocity = 8.9±2.4 cm/second versus 10.1±2.4 cm/second; <i>P</i>=0.035) compared with users currently off-drug (N=28). In addition, AAS users demonstrated higher coronary artery plaque volume than nonusers (median [interquartile range] 3 [0, 174] mL<sup>3</sup> versus 0 [0, 69] mL<sup>3</sup>; <i>P</i>=0.012). Lifetime AAS dose was strongly associated with coronary atherosclerotic burden (increase [95% confidence interval] in rank of plaque volume for each 10-year increase in cumulative duration of AAS use: 0.60 SD units [0.16–1.03 SD units]; <i>P</i>=0.008).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Long-term AAS use appears to be associated with myocardial dysfunction and accelerated coronary atherosclerosis.

Association of Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Venous Thromboembolism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Much controversy surrounds the association of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors with venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an individual level random-effect meta-analysis including 9 prospective studies with measured baseline cardiovascular disease risk factors and validated VTE events. Definitions were harmonized across studies. Traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors were modeled categorically and continuously using restricted cubic splines. Estimates were obtained for overall VTE, provoked VTE (ie, VTE occurring in the presence of 1 or more established VTE risk factors), and unprovoked VTE, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The studies included 244 865 participants with 4910 VTE events occurring during a mean follow-up of 4.7 to 19.7 years per study. Age, sex, and body mass index-adjusted hazard ratios for overall VTE were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89−1.07) for hypertension, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88−1.08) for hyperlipidemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89−1.15) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08−1.32) for current smoking. After full adjustment, these estimates were numerically similar. When modeled continuously, an inverse association was observed for systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e (hazard ratio=0.79 [95% CI: 0.68−0.92] at systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e 160 vs 110 mm Hg) but not for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e or lipid measures with VTE. An important finding from VTE subtype analyses was that cigarette smoking was associated with provoked but not unprovoked VTE. Fully adjusted hazard ratios for the associations of current smoking with provoked and unprovoked VTE were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.22−1.52) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.90−1.29), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Except for the association between cigarette smoking and provoked VTE, which is potentially mediated through comorbid conditions such as cancer, the modifiable traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors are not associated with increased VTE risk. Higher systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e showed an inverse association with VTE.</p></sec>

Inhibiting Insulin-Mediated β<sub>2</sub>-Adrenergic Receptor Activation Prevents Diabetes-Associated Cardiac Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity independently increase the risk of heart failure by incompletely understood mechanisms. We propose that hyperinsulinemia might promote adverse consequences in the hearts of subjects with type-2 DM and obesity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>High-fat diet feeding was used to induce obesity and DM in wild-type mice or mice lacking β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) or β-arrestin2. Wild-type mice fed with high-fat diet were treated with a β-blocker carvedilol or a GRK2 (G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2) inhibitor. We examined signaling and cardiac contractile function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>High-fat diet feeding selectively increases the expression of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) in mouse hearts, in concert with reduced protein kinase A phosphorylation of phospholamban, which contributes to systolic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic dysfunction. The expression of PDE4D is also elevated in human hearts with DM. The induction of PDE4D expression is mediated by an insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate, and GRK2 and β-arrestin2-dependent transactivation of a β<sub>2</sub>AR-extracellular regulated protein kinase signaling cascade. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of β<sub>2</sub>AR or GRK2, or genetic deletion of β<sub>2</sub>AR or β-arrestin2, all significantly attenuate insulin-induced phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinase and PDE4D induction to prevent DM-related contractile dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These studies elucidate a novel mechanism by which hyperinsulinemia contributes to heart failure by increasing PDE4D expression and identify β<sub>2</sub>AR or GRK2 as plausible therapeutic targets for preventing or treating heart failure in subjects with type 2 DM.</p></sec>

Detailed Echocardiographic Phenotyping in Breast Cancer Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease in patients with breast cancer is of growing concern. The longitudinal effects of commonly used therapies, including doxorubicin and trastuzumab, on cardiac remodeling and function remain unknown in this population. We aimed to define the changes in echocardiographic parameters of structure, function, and ventricular-arterial coupling, and their associations with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and heart failure symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a longitudinal prospective cohort study of 277 breast cancer participants receiving doxorubicin (Dox), trastuzumab (Tras), or both (Dox+Tras), we obtained 1249 echocardiograms over a median follow-up of 2.0 (interquartile range, 1.0–3.0) years. Left ventricular structure, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic and contractile function, and ventricular-arterial coupling measures were quantified in a core laboratory blinded to participant characteristics. We evaluated changes in echocardiographic parameters over time, and used repeated-measures regression models to define their association with LVEF decline and recovery. Linear regression models defined the association between early changes in these parameters and subsequent changes in LVEF and heart failure symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 177 (64%) received Dox, 51 (18%) received Tras, and 49 (18%) received Dox+Tras. With Dox, there was a sustained, modest decrease in LVEF over the follow-up duration (1-year change in LVEF –3.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], –4.4% to –2.8%; 3-year change –3.8%; 95% CI, –5.1% to –2.5%). With Tras, a similar LVEF decline was observed at 1 year (–4.5%; 95% CI, –6.0% to –2.9%) and 3 years (–2.8%; 95%CI, –5.3 to –0.4%). Participants receiving Dox+Tras demonstrated the greatest declines at 1 year (–6.6%; 95% CI, –8.2 to –5.0%), with partial recovery at 3 years (–2.8%; 95% CI, –4.8 to –0.8%). LVEF declines and recovery were associated primarily with changes in systolic volumes, longitudinal and circumferential strain, and ventricular-arterial coupling indices, effective arterial elastance (Ea) and the coupling ratio Ea/Ees<sub>sb</sub>, without evidence for effect modification across therapies. Early changes in volumes, strain, and Ea/Ees<sub>sb</sub> at 4 to 6 months were associated with 1- and 2-year LVEF changes. Similarly, early changes in strain and Ea were associated with worsening heart failure symptoms at 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Doxorubicin and trastuzumab resulted in modest, persistent declines in LVEF at 3 years. Changes in volumes, strain, and ventricular-arterial coupling were consistently associated with concurrent and subsequent LVEF declines and recovery across therapies.</p></sec>

High-Fiber Diet and Acetate Supplementation Change the Gut Microbiota and Prevent the Development of Hypertension and Heart Failure in Hypertensive Mice
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Dietary intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with lower incidence of hypertension, but the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Here, we evaluated the effect of a high-fiber diet and supplementation with the short-chain fatty acid acetate on the gut microbiota and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gut microbiome, cardiorenal structure/function, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>e were examined in sham and mineralocorticoid excess–treated mice with a control diet, high-fiber diet, or acetate supplementation. We also determined the renal and cardiac transcriptome of mice treated with the different diets.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that high consumption of fiber modified the gut microbiota populations and increased the abundance of acetate-producing bacteria independently of mineralocorticoid excess. Both fiber and acetate decreased gut dysbiosis, measured by the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and increased the prevalence of <i>Bacteroides acidifaciens</i>. Compared with mineralocorticoid-excess mice fed a control diet, both high-fiber diet and acetate supplementation significantly reduced systolic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood pressur</span></strong>es, cardiac fibrosis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Acetate had similar effects and markedly reduced renal fibrosis. Transcriptome analyses showed that the protective effects of high fiber and acetate were accompanied by the downregulation of cardiac and renal <i>Egr1</i>, a master cardiovascular regulator involved in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiorenal fibrosis, and inflammation. We also observed the upregulation of a network of genes involved in circadian rhythm in both tissues and downregulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A diet high in fiber led to changes in the gut microbiota that played a protective role in the development of cardiovascular disease. The favorable effects of fiber may be explained by the generation and distribution of one of the main metabolites of the gut microbiota, the short-chain fatty acid acetate. Acetate effected several molecular changes associated with improved cardiovascular health and function.</p></sec>

Comparative Prognostic Utility of Indexes of Microvascular Function Alone or in Combination in Patients With an Acute ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is frequently successful at restoring coronary artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood flow</span></strong> in patients with acute ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction; however, failed myocardial reperfusion commonly passes undetected in up to half of these patients. The index of microvascular resistance (IMR) is a novel invasive measure of coronary microvascular function. We aimed to investigate the pathological and prognostic significance of an IMR>40, alone or in combination with a coronary flow reserve (CFR≤2.0), in the culprit artery after emergency percutaneous coronary intervention for acute ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with acute ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction were prospectively enrolled during emergency percutaneous coronary intervention and categorized according to IMR (≤40 or >40) and CFR (≤2.0 or >2.0). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was acquired 2 days and 6 months after myocardial infarction. All-cause death or first heart failure hospitalization was a prespecified outcome (median follow-up, 845 days).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IMR and CFR were measured in the culprit artery at the end of percutaneous coronary intervention in 283 patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (mean±SD age, 60±12 years; 73% male). The median IMR and CFR were 25 (interquartile range, 15–48) and 1.6 (interquartile range, 1.1–2.1), respectively. An IMR>40 was a multivariable associate of myocardial hemorrhage (odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–4.27; <i>P</i>=0.042). An IMR>40 was closely associated with microvascular obstruction. Symptom-to-reperfusion time, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) blush grade, and no (≤30%) ST-segment resolution were not associated with these pathologies. An IMR>40 was a multivariable associate of the changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (coefficient, −2.12; 95% confidence interval, −4.02 to −0.23; <i>P</i>=0.028) and left ventricular end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic volume (coefficient, 7.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–15.29; <i>P</i>=0.039) at 6 months independently of infarct size. An IMR>40 (odds ratio, 4.36; 95% confidence interval, 2.10–9.06; <i>P</i><0.001) was a multivariable associate of all-cause death or heart failure.

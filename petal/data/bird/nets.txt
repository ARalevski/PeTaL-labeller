Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s to transport resources and information. Biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s must trade-off <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> efficiency with the risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> failure. Yet, biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s with minimal length paths through the maze after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in dynamic environments.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Theory
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators are phases of matter characterized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder. These attributes make <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical effects in a unique way: the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser. These are lasers whose lasing mode exhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport without magnetic fields. The underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties lead to a highly efficient laser, robust to defects and disorder, with single-mode lasing even at very high gain values. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and at the same time opens exciting possibilities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical physics, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser provides a route to arrays of semiconductor lasers that operate as one single-mode high-power laser coupled efficiently into an output port.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Experiments
<p>Physical systems exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical invariants are naturally endowed with robustness against perturbations, as manifested in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators—materials exhibiting robust electron transport, immune from scattering by defects and disorder. Recent years have witnessed intense efforts toward exploiting these phenomena in photonics. Here we demonstrate a nonmagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser system exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport in the cavity. Its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties give rise to single-mode lasing, robustness against defects, and considerably higher slope efficiencies compared to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically trivial counterparts. We further exploit the properties of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical platforms by assembling the system from <i>S</i>-chiral microresonators, enforcing predetermined unidirectional lasing without magnetic fields. This work paves the way toward active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical devices with exciting properties and functionalities.</p>

The fundamental advantages of temporal networks
<p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>ed systems of scientific interest are characterized by temporal links, meaning the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>’s structure changes over time. Link temporality has been shown to hinder many dynamical processes, from information spreading to accessibility, by disrupting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> paths. Considering the ubiquity of temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in nature, we ask: Are there any advantages of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s’ temporality? We use an analytical framework to show that temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s can, compared to their static counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand orders of magnitude less control energy, and have control trajectories, that are considerably more compact than those characterizing static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s. Thus, temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, enhancing our ability to control them.</p>

Structural topology defines protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes in the HIV proteome
<p>Mutationally constrained epitopes of variable pathogens represent promising targets for vaccine design but are not reliably identified by sequence conservation. In this study, we employed structure-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> analysis, which applies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> theory to HIV protein structure data to quantitate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical importance of individual amino acid residues. Mutation of residues at important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> positions disproportionately impaired viral replication and occurred with high frequency in epitopes presented by protective human leukocyte antigen (<i>HLA</i>) class I alleles. Moreover, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell targeting of highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>ed epitopes distinguished individuals who naturally control HIV, even in the absence of protective <i>HLA</i> alleles. This approach thereby provides a mechanistic basis for immune control and a means to identify CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical importance for rational immunogen design, including a T cell–based HIV vaccine.</p>

Observation of the topological Anderson insulator in disordered atomic wires
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y and disorder have a rich combined influence on quantum transport. To probe their interplay, we synthesized one-dimensional chiral symmetric wires with controllable disorder via spectroscopic Hamiltonian engineering, based on the laser-driven coupling of discrete momentum states of ultracold atoms. Measuring the bulk evolution of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical indicator after a sudden quench, we observed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical Anderson insulator phase, in which added disorder drives the band structure of a wire from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically trivial to nontrivial. In addition, we observed the robustness of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically nontrivial wires to weak disorder and measured the transition to a trivial phase in the presence of strong disorder. Atomic interactions in this quantum simulation platform may enable realizations of strongly interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical fluids.</p>

Quantized electric multipole insulators
<p>The Berry phase provides a modern formulation of electric polarization in crystals. We extend this concept to higher electric multipole moments and determine the necessary conditions and minimal models for which the quadrupole and octupole moments are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically quantized electromagnetic observables. Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical phases. Furthermore, they host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating phases of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical behavior that can be immediately tested. Our work opens a venue for the expansion of the classification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical phases of matter.</p>

Network Modeling Unravels Mechanisms of Crosstalk between Ethylene and Salicylate Signaling in Potato
<p>To develop novel crop breeding strategies, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between plants and their pathogens. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling represents a powerful tool that can unravel properties of complex biological systems. In this study, we aimed to use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling to better understand immune signaling in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>). For this, we first built on a reliable Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) immune signaling model, extending it with the information from diverse publicly available resources. Next, we translated the resulting prior knowledge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> (20,012 nodes and 70,091 connections) to potato and superimposed it with an ensemble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> inferred from time-resolved transcriptomics data for potato. We used different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling approaches to generate specific hypotheses of potato immune signaling mechanisms. An interesting finding was the identification of a string of molecular events illuminating the ethylene pathway modulation of the salicylic acid pathway through Nonexpressor of PR Genes1 gene expression. Functional validations confirmed this modulation, thus supporting the potential of our integrative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling approach for unraveling molecular mechanisms in complex systems. In addition, this approach can ultimately result in improved breeding strategies for potato and other sensitive crops.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s together resulted in improved performance compared to single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, reconstructing such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee reconstruction accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to construct a phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in reconstructing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

Anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning are coordinated by an identical patterning clock
<p>Establishment of the body plan in vertebrates depends on the temporally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coordin</span></strong>ated patterning of tissues along the body axes. We have previously shown that dorsoventral (DV) tissues are temporally patterned progressively from anterior to posterior by a BMP signaling pathway. Here we report that DV patterning along the zebrafish anteroposterior (AP) axis is temporally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coordin</span></strong>ated with AP patterning by an identical patterning clock. We altered AP patterning by inhibiting or activating FGF, Wnt or retinoic acid signaling combined with inhibition of BMP signaling at a series of developmental time points, which revealed that the temporal progression of DV patterning is directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coordin</span></strong>ated with AP patterning. We investigated how these signaling pathways are integrated and suggest a model for how DV and AP patterning are temporally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coordin</span></strong>ated. It has been shown that in <i>Xenopus</i> dorsal tissues FGF and Wnt signaling quell BMP signaling by degrading phosphorylated (P) Smad1/5, the BMP pathway signal transducer, via phosphorylation of the Smad1/5 linker region. We show that in zebrafish FGF/MAPK, but not Wnt/GSK3, phosphorylation of the Smad1/5 linker region localizes to a ventral vegetal gastrula region that could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coordin</span></strong>ate DV patterning with AP patterning ventrally without degrading P-Smad1/5. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alteration of the MAPK phosphorylation sites in the Smad5 linker causes precocious patterning of DV tissues along the AP axis during gastrulation. Thus, DV and AP patterning are intimately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coordin</span></strong>ated to allow cells to acquire both positional and temporal information simultaneously.</p>

Structure, spatial dynamics, and stability of novel seed dispersal mutualistic networks in Hawai<bold></bold>i
<p>Increasing rates of human-caused species invasions and extinctions may reshape communities and modify the structure, dynamics, and stability of species interactions. To investigate how such changes affect communities, we performed multiscale analyses of seed dispersal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s on Oahu, Hawaii. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s consisted exclusively of novel interactions, were largely dominated by introduced species, and exhibited specialized and modular structure at local and regional scales, despite high interaction dissimilarity across communities. Furthermore, the structure and stability of the novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s were similar to native-dominated communities worldwide. Our findings suggest that shared evolutionary history is not a necessary process for the emergence of complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> structure, and interaction patterns may be highly conserved, regardless of species identity and environment. Introduced species can quickly become well integrated into novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, making restoration of native ecosystems more challenging than previously thought.</p>

Consensus Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Key Regulators of Flower and Fruit Development in Wild Strawberry
<p>The diploid strawberry, <i>Fragaria vesca</i>, is a developing model system for the economically important Rosaceae family. Strawberry fleshy fruit develops from the floral receptacle and its ripening is nonclimacteric. The external seed configuration of strawberry fruit facilitates the study of seed-to-fruit cross tissue communication, particularly phytohormone biosynthesis and transport. To investigate strawberry fruit development, we previously generated spatial and temporal transcriptome data profiling <i>F. vesca</i> flower and fruit development pre- and postfertilization. In this study, we combined 46 of our existing RNA-seq libraries to generate coexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s using the Weighted Gene Co-Expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> Analysis package in R. We then applied a post-hoc consensus clustering approach and used bootstrapping to demonstrate consensus clustering’s ability to produce robust and reproducible clusters. Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, including increased iron transport from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene. To increase their utility, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s are presented in a web interface (<ext-link>www.fv.rosaceaefruits.org</ext-link>) for easy exploration and identification of coexpressed genes.

ChloroKB: A Web Application for the Integration of Knowledge Related to Chloroplast Metabolic Network

Although structural models (stoichiometry matrices) and pathway databases are extremely useful, they cannot describe the complexity of the metabolic context, and new tools are required to visually represent integrated biocurated knowledge for use by both humans and computers.

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> was manually reconstructed through extensive biocuration to provide transparent traceability of experimental data. Proteins and metabolites were placed in their biological context (spatial distribution within cells, connectivity in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, participation in supramolecular complexes, and regulatory interactions) using CellDesigner software. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> contains 1,147 reviewed proteins (559 localized exclusively in plastids, 68 in at least one additional compartment, and 520 outside the plastid), 122 proteins awaiting biochemical/genetic characterization, and 228 proteins for which genes have not yet been identified. The visual presentation is intuitive and browsing is fluid, providing instant access to the graphical representation of integrated processes and to a wealth of refined qualitative and quantitative data. ChloroKB will be a significant support for structural and quantitative kinetic modeling, for biological reasoning, when comparing novel data with established knowledge, for computer analyses, and for educational purposes. ChloroKB will be enhanced by continuous updates following contributions from plant researchers.</p>

A comprehensive understanding of arterial protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s and how they change in early atherosclerosis could identify new biomarkers for disease detection and improved therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here we describe the human arterial proteome and proteomic features strongly associated with early atherosclerosis based on mass spectrometry analysis of coronary artery and aortic specimens from 100 autopsied young adults (200 arterial specimens). Convex analysis of mixtures, differential dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling, and bioinformatic analyses defined the composition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> rewiring, and likely regulatory features of the protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s associated with early atherosclerosis and how they vary across 2 anatomic distributions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The data document significant differences in mitochondrial protein abundance between coronary and aortic samples (coronary>>aortic), and between atherosclerotic and normal tissues (atherosclerotic<<normal), and major alterations in tumor necrosis factor, insulin receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, as well, in the setting of early disease. In addition, a subset of tissue protein biomarkers indicative of early atherosclerosis was shown to predict anatomically defined coronary atherosclerosis when measured in plasma samples in a separate clinical cohort (area under the curve=0.92 [0.83–0.96]), thereby validating the use of human tissue proteomics to discover relevant plasma biomarkers for clinical applications. In addition to the specific proteins and pathways identified here, the publicly available data resource and the analysis pipeline used illustrate a strategy for interrogating and interpreting the proteomic architecture of tissues that may be relevant for other chronic diseases characterized by multicellular tissue phenotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The human arterial proteome can be viewed as a complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> whose architectural features vary considerably as a function of anatomic location and the presence or absence of atherosclerosis.

Social network plasticity decreases disease transmission in a eusocial insect
<p>Animal social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s are shaped by multiple selection pressures, including the need to ensure efficient communication and functioning while simultaneously limiting disease transmission. Social animals could potentially further reduce epidemic risk by altering their social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in the presence of pathogens, yet there is currently no evidence for such pathogen-triggered responses. We tested this hypothesis experimentally in the ant <i>Lasius niger</i> using a combination of automated tracking, controlled pathogen exposure, transmission quantification, and temporally explicit simulations. Pathogen exposure induced behavioral changes in both exposed ants and their nestmates, which helped contain the disease by reinforcing key transmission-inhibitory properties of the colony’s contact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. This suggests that social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> plasticity in response to pathogens is an effective strategy for mitigating the effects of disease in social groups.</p>

Quantifying reputation and success in art
<p>In areas of human activity where performance is difficult to quantify in an objective fashion, reputation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s of influence play a key role in determining access to resources and rewards. To understand the role of these factors, we reconstructed the exhibition history of half a million artists, mapping out the coexhibition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> that captures the movement of art between institutions. Centrality within this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> captured institutional prestige, allowing us to explore the career trajectory of individual artists in terms of access to coveted institutions. Early access to prestigious central institutions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central institutions. A Markov model predicts the career trajectory of individual artists and documents the strong path and history dependence of valuation in art.</p>

Second Chern number of a quantum-simulated non-Abelian Yang monopole
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical order is often quantified in terms of Chern numbers, each of which classifies a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical singularity. Here, inspired by concepts from high-energy physics, we use quantum simulation based on the spin degrees of freedom of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates to characterize a singularity present in five-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories—a Yang monopole. We quantify the monopole in terms of Chern numbers measured on enclosing manifolds: Whereas the well-known first Chern number vanishes, the second Chern number does not. By displacing the manifold, we induce and observe a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical transition, where the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y of the manifold changes to a trivial state.</p>

Systematic analysis of complex genetic interactions

We selected double-mutant query genes across a broad spectrum of biological processes, spanning a range of quantitative features of the global digenic interaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> and tested for a genetic interaction with a third mutation. Trigenic interactions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic interactions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic interactions. We estimate that the global trigenic interaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> is ~100 times as large as the global digenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, highlighting the potential for complex genetic interactions to affect the biology of inheritance, including the genotype-to-phenotype relationship.</p>

Observation of topological superconductivity on the surface of an iron-based superconductor

Most of the proposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical superconductors are realized in difficult-to-fabricate heterostructures at very low temperatures.

Observation of fractional Chern insulators in a van der Waals heterostructure
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically ordered phases are characterized by long-range quantum entanglement and fractional statistics rather than by symmetry breaking. First observed in a fractionally filled continuum Landau level, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical order has since been proposed to arise more generally at fractional fillings of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically nontrivial Chern bands. Here we report the observation of gapped states at fractional fillings of Harper-Hofstadter bands arising from the interplay of a magnetic field and a superlattice potential in a bilayer graphene–hexagonal boron nitride heterostructure. We observed phases at fractional filling of bands with Chern indices [Formula]. Some of these phases, in [Formula] and [Formula] bands, are characterized by fractional Hall conductance—that is, they are known as fractional Chern insulators and constitute an example of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical order beyond Landau levels.</p>

Small vulnerable sets determine large network cascades in power grids

Using the North American power grid, we identified, quantified, and analyzed the set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> components that are vulnerable to cascading failures under any out of multiple conditions. We show that the vulnerable set consists of a small but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically central portion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> and that large cascades are disproportionately more likely to be triggered by initial failures close to this set.

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

Entanglement distillation between solid-state quantum network nodes

The heralded generation of two copies of a remote entangled state is demonstrated through single-photon–mediated entangling of the electrons and robust storage in the nuclear spins. After applying local two-qubit gates, single-shot measurements herald the distillation of an entangled state with increased fidelity that is available for further use. The key combination of generating, storing, and processing entangled states should enable the exploration of multiparticle entanglement on an extended quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>.</p>

Ring attractor dynamics in the <i>Drosophila</i> central brain

Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> structures, schematized as a ring of neurons whose connectivity depends on their heading preferences, can sustain a bump-like activity pattern whose location can be updated by continuous shifts along either turn direction. We recently reported that a population of fly neurons represents the animal’s heading via bump-like activity dynamics. We combined two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed flying flies with optogenetics to overwrite the existing population representation with an artificial one, which was then maintained by the circuit with naturalistic dynamics. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> with local excitation and global inhibition enforces this unique and persistent heading representation.

The Ring-Type E3 Ubiquitin Ligase JUL1 Targets the VQ-Motif Protein JAV1 to Coordinate Jasmonate Signaling
<p>Jasmonates regulate plant defense and development. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED VQ-MOTIF GENE1 (JAV1/VQ22) is a repressor of jasmonate-mediated defense responses and is degraded through the ubiquitin<i>-</i>26S proteasome system after herbivory. We found that JAV1-ASSOCIATED UBIQUITIN LIGASE1 (JUL1), a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacted with JAV1. JUL1 interacted with JAV1 in the nucleus to ubiquitinate JAV1, leading to proteasomal degradation of JAV1. The transcript levels of <i>JUL1</i> and <i>JAV1</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coordin</span></strong>ately and positively regulated by the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1-dependent signaling pathway in the jasmonate signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, but in a manner that was not dependent on CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1-mediated signaling upon herbivory by <i>Spodoptera litura</i>. Gain or loss of function of JUL1 modulated the expression levels of the defensin gene <i>PDF1.2</i> in leaves, conferring on the plants various defense properties against the generalist herbivore <i>S. litura</i>. Because neither the <i>JUL1</i> mutant nor overexpression lines showed any obvious developmental defects, we concluded that the JAV1/JUL1 system functions as a specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coordin</span></strong>ator of reprogramming of plant defense responses. Altogether, our findings offer insight into the mechanisms by which the JAV1/JUL1 system acts specifically to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coordin</span></strong>ate plant defense responses without interfering with plant development or growth.</p>

K<sup>+</sup> Efflux Antiporters 4, 5, and 6 Mediate pH and K<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis in Endomembrane Compartments
<p>KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) K<sup>+</sup> efflux antiporter (KEA) family that share high sequence similarity but whose function remains unknown. Here, we show their gene expression pattern, subcellular localization, and physiological function in Arabidopsis. <i>KEA4</i>, <i>KEA5</i>, and <i>KEA6</i> had similar tissue expression patterns, and the three KEA proteins localized to the Golgi, the trans-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, and the prevacuolar compartment/multivesicular bodies, suggesting overlapping roles of these proteins in the endomembrane system. Phenotypic analyses of single, double, and triple mutants confirmed functional redundancy.

Also, the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant plants had a reduced luminal pH in the Golgi, trans-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, prevacuolar compartment, and vacuole, in accordance with the K/H exchange activity of KEA proteins.

The NHX1 and NHX2 proteins in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background could not suppress the acidity of the endomembrane system but brought the vacuolar pH close to wild-type values.

Distinguishing a Majorana zero mode using spin-resolved measurements

Toughening elastomers using mussel-inspired iron-catechol complexes

The iron-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> exhibits two to three orders of magnitude increases in stiffness, tensile strength, and tensile toughness compared to its iron-free precursor while gaining recoverable hysteretic energy dissipation and maintaining its original extensibility. Compared to previous realizations of this chemistry in hydrogels, the dry nature of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> enables larger property enhancement owing to the cooperative effects of both the increased cross-link density given by the reversible iron-catecholate complexes and the chain-restricting ionomeric nanodomains that they form.</p>

Two areas for familiar face recognition in the primate brain
<p>Familiarity alters face recognition: Familiar faces are recognized more accurately than unfamiliar ones and under difficult viewing conditions when unfamiliar face recognition fails.

Familiar faces also recruited two hitherto unknown face areas at anatomically conserved locations within the perirhinal cortex and the temporal pole. These two areas, but not the core face-processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, responded to familiar faces emerging from a blur with a characteristic nonlinear surge, akin to the abruptness of familiar face recognition.

Quantized Faraday and Kerr rotation and axion electrodynamics of a 3D topological insulator
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators have been proposed to be best characterized as bulk magnetoelectric materials that show response functions quantized in terms of fundamental physical constants. Here, we lower the chemical potential of three-dimensional (3D) Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> films to ~30 meV above the Dirac point and probe their low-energy electrodynamic response in the presence of magnetic fields with high-precision time-domain terahertz polarimetry. For fields higher than 5 tesla, we observed quantized Faraday and Kerr rotations, whereas the dc transport is still semiclassical.

Command of active matter by topological defects and patterns
<p>Self-propelled bacteria are marvels of nature with a potential to power dynamic materials and microsystems of the future. The challenge lies in commanding their chaotic behavior. By dispersing swimming <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> in a liquid crystalline environment with spatially varying orientation of the anisotropy axis, we demonstrate control over the distribution of bacterial concentration, as well as the geometry and polarity of their trajectories. Bacteria recognize subtle differences in liquid crystal deformations, engaging in bipolar swimming in regions of pure splay and bend but switching to unipolar swimming in mixed splay-bend regions. They differentiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical defects, heading toward defects of positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical charge and avoiding negative charges. Sensitivity of bacteria to preimposed orientational patterns represents a previously unknown facet of the interplay between hydrodynamics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y of active matter.</p>

A transcription factor hierarchy defines an environmental stress response network
<p>Environmental stresses are universally encountered by microbes, plants, and animals. Yet systematic studies of stress-responsive transcription factor (TF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in multicellular organisms have been limited. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) influences the expression of thousands of genes, allowing us to characterize complex stress-responsive regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, we identified genome-wide targets of 21 ABA-related TFs to construct a comprehensive regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Determinants of dynamic TF binding and a hierarchy among TFs were defined, illuminating the relationship between differential gene expression patterns and ABA pathway feedback regulation. By extrapolating regulatory characteristics of observed canonical ABA pathway components, we identified a new family of transcriptional regulators modulating ABA and salt responsiveness and demonstrated their utility to modulate plant resilience to osmotic stress.</p>

A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring diagram of cellular function
<p>We generated a global genetic interaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> maps genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> illustrates how coherent sets of genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.</p>

Timing and Order of the Molecular Events Marking the Onset of Berry Ripening in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a model for the investigation of physiological and biochemical changes during the formation and ripening of nonclimacteric fleshy fruits. However, the order and complexity of the molecular events during fruit development remain poorly understood. To identify the key molecular events controlling berry formation and ripening, we created a highly detailed transcriptomic and metabolomic map of berry development, based on samples collected every week from fruit set to maturity in two grapevine genotypes for three consecutive years, resulting in 219 samples. Major transcriptomic changes were represented by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coordin</span></strong>ated waves of gene expression associated with early development, veraison (onset of ripening)/midripening, and late-ripening and were consistent across vintages. The two genotypes were clearly distinguished by metabolite profiles and transcriptional changes occurring primarily at the veraison/midripening phase. Coexpression analysis identified a core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> of transcripts as well as variations in the within-module connections representing varietal differences. By focusing on transcriptome rearrangements close to veraison, we identified two rapid and successive shared transitions involving genes whose expression profiles precisely locate the timing of the molecular reprogramming of berry development. Functional analyses of two transcription factors, markers of the first transition, suggested that they participate in a hierarchical cascade of gene activation at the onset of ripening. This study defined the initial transcriptional events that mark and trigger the onset of ripening and the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> that characterizes the whole process of berry development, providing a framework to model fruit development and maturation in grapevine.</p>

SHORTROOT-Mediated Increase in Stomatal Density Has No Impact on Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coordin</span></strong>ated positioning of veins, mesophyll cells, and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration and, therefore, for overall function. In monocot leaves, stomatal cell files are positioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf veins, rather than directly above or below. This pattern suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal cells directly in contact with the vein or that specification is induced in cell files beyond the vein. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct cell types around the vasculature in subepidermal layers of both root and shoots, with cell type identity determined by distance from the vein. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal cell types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp <i>japonica</i>) <i>OsSHR2</i> gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle sheath cells encircling the vein. In transgenic lines, which were generated using the orthologous <i>ZmSHR1</i> gene to avoid potential silencing of <i>OsSHR2</i>, stomatal cell files were observed both in the normal position and in more distant positions from the vein. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot leaves, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll cell density. Collectively, these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coordin</span></strong>ate the positioning of veins and stomata in monocot leaves and that distinct mechanisms may operate in monocot and eudicot leaves to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coordin</span></strong>ate stomatal patterning with the development of underlying mesophyll cells.</p>

The G-Box Transcriptional Regulatory Code in Arabidopsis
<p>Plants have significantly more transcription factor (TF) families than animals and fungi, and plant TF families tend to contain more genes; these expansions are linked to adaptation to environmental stressors. Many TF family members bind to similar or identical sequence motifs, such as G-boxes (CACGTG), so it is difficult to predict regulatory relationships. We determined that the flanking sequences near G-boxes help determine in vitro specificity but that this is insufficient to predict the transcription pattern of genes near G-boxes. Therefore, we constructed a gene regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> that identifies the set of bZIPs and bHLHs that are most predictive of the expression of genes downstream of perfect G-boxes. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> accurately predicts transcriptional patterns and reconstructs known regulatory sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s. Finally, we present Ara-BOX-cis (araboxcis.org), a Web site that provides interactive visualizations of the G-box regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, a useful resource for generating predictions for gene regulatory relations.</p>

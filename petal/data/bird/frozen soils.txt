Speleothems Reveal 500,000-Year History of Siberian Permafrost
<sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permafrost</span></strong> Thaw Predictions</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permafrost</span></strong> contains twice as much carbon as the atmosphere which could have serious consequences if it were to be released by widespread thawing. <bold>Vaks <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 183, published online 21 February) present a 450,000 year-long record of speleothem growth at selected locations in Siberia, which traces changes in the extent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permafrost</span></strong> over that time period. The authors conclude that conditions only slightly warmer than those of today would cause widespread thawing of continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permafrost</span></strong> as far north as 60Â°N.</p></sec>

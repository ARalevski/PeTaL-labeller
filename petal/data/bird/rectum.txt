Stroma provides an intestinal stem cell niche in the absence of epithelial Wnts
<p>Wnt/β-catenin signaling supports <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al homeostasis by regulating proliferation in the crypt. Multiple Wnts are expressed in Paneth cells as well as other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al epithelial and stromal cells. <i>Ex vivo</i>, Wnts secreted by Paneth cells can support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al stem cells when Wnt signaling is enhanced with supplemental R-Spondin 1 (RSPO1). However, <i>in vivo</i>, the source of Wnts in the stem cell niche is less clear. Genetic ablation of <i>Porcn</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum resident O-acyltransferase that is essential for the secretion and activity of all vertebrate Wnts, confirmed the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al epithelial Wnts in <i>ex vivo</i> culture. Unexpectedly, mice lacking epithelial Wnt activity (<i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup>/Villin-Cre</i> mice) had normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al proliferation and differentiation, as well as successful regeneration after radiation injury, indicating that epithelial Wnts are dispensable for these processes. Consistent with a key role for stroma in the crypt niche, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al stromal cells endogenously expressing Wnts and <i>Rspo3</i> support the growth of <i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup></i> organoids <i>ex vivo</i> without RSPO1 supplementation. Conversely, increasing pharmacologic PORCN inhibition, affecting both stroma and epithelium, reduced <i>Lgr5</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al stem cells, inhibited recovery from radiation injury, and at the highest dose fully blocked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al proliferation. We conclude that epithelial Wnts are dispensable and that stromal production of Wnts can fully support normal murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al homeostasis.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e generates luminal carbonate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al water absorption, allowing excess water to be shunted through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water absorption, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al water absorption as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al water absorption and excretion through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e and kidneys.</p>

<i>H. pylori</i> virulence factor CagA increases intestinal cell proliferation by Wnt pathway activation in a transgenic zebrafish model
<p>Infection with <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> is a major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer, and infection with strains carrying the virulence factor CagA significantly increases this risk. To investigate the mechanisms by which CagA promotes carcinogenesis, we generated transgenic zebrafish expressing CagA ubiquitously or in the anterior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e. Transgenic zebrafish expressing either the wild-type or a phosphorylation-resistant form of CagA exhibited significantly increased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al epithelial cell proliferation and showed significant upregulation of the Wnt target genes <i>cyclinD1</i>, <i>axin2</i> and the zebrafish <i>c-myc</i> ortholog <i>myca</i>. Coexpression of CagA with a loss-of-function allele encoding the β-catenin destruction complex protein Axin1 resulted in a further increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al proliferation. Coexpression of CagA with a null allele of the key β-catenin transcriptional cofactor Tcf4 restored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al proliferation to wild-type levels. These results provide <i>in vivo</i> evidence of Wnt pathway activation by CagA downstream of or in parallel to the β-catenin destruction complex and upstream of Tcf4. Long-term transgenic expression of wild-type CagA, but not the phosphorylation-resistant form, resulted in significant hyperplasia of the adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al epithelium. We further utilized this model to demonstrate that oncogenic cooperation between CagA and a loss-of-function allele of <i>p53</i> is sufficient to induce high rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, establishing the utility of our transgenic zebrafish model in the study of CagA-associated gastro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al cancers.</p>

Hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier dysfunction and risk for enteric infection
<p>Obesity, diabetes, and related manifestations are associated with an enhanced, but poorly understood, risk for mucosal infection and systemic inflammation. Here, we show in mouse models of obesity and diabetes that hyperglycemia drives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al barrier permeability, through GLUT2-dependent transcriptional reprogramming of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al epithelial cells and alteration of tight and adherence junction integrity. Consequently, hyperglycemia-mediated barrier disruption leads to systemic influx of microbial products and enhanced dissemination of enteric infection. Treatment of hyperglycemia, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al epithelial–specific GLUT2 deletion, or inhibition of glucose metabolism restores barrier function and bacterial containment. In humans, systemic influx of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al microbiome products correlates with individualized glycemic control, indicated by glycated hemoglobin levels. Together, our results mechanistically link hyperglycemia and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al barrier function with systemic infectious and inflammatory consequences of obesity and diabetes.</p>

Ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the intestine drives T<sub>H</sub>1 cell induction and inflammation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al colonization by bacteria of oral origin has been correlated with several negative health outcomes, including inflammatory bowel disease. However, a causal role of oral bacteria ectopically colonizing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e remains unclear. Using gnotobiotic techniques, we show that strains of <i>Klebsiella</i> spp. isolated from the salivary microbiota are strong inducers of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) cells when they colonize in the gut. These <i>Klebsiella</i> strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics, tend to colonize when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al microbiota is dysbiotic, and elicit a severe gut inflammation in the context of a genetically susceptible host.

The intestinal microbiota regulates body composition through NFIL<bold>3</bold> and the circadian clock
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al microbiota has been identified as an environmental factor that markedly affects energy storage and body-fat accumulation in mammals, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that the microbiota regulates body composition through the circadian transcription factor NFIL3. <i>Nfil3</i> transcription oscillates diurnally in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al epithelial cells, and the amplitude of the circadian oscillation is controlled by the microbiota through group 3 innate lymphoid cells, STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and the epithelial cell circadian clock.

These findings provide mechanistic insight into how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al microbiota regulates body composition and establish NFIL3 as an essential molecular link among the microbiota, the circadian clock, and host metabolism.</p>

Replication of human noroviruses in stem cell–derived human enteroids
<p>The major barrier to research and development of effective interventions for human noroviruses (HuNoVs) has been the lack of a robust and reproducible in vitro cultivation system. HuNoVs are the leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. We report the successful cultivation of multiple HuNoV strains in enterocytes in stem cell–derived, nontransformed human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al enteroid monolayer cultures. Bile, a critical factor of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al milieu, is required for strain-dependent HuNoV replication. Lack of appropriate histoblood group antigen expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al cells restricts virus replication, and infectivity is abrogated by inactivation (e.g., irradiation, heating) and serum neutralization. This culture system recapitulates the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al epithelium, permits human host-pathogen studies of previously noncultivatable pathogens, and allows the assessment of methods to prevent and treat HuNoV infections.</p>

Migration of <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal stem cells across organ boundaries
<p>All components of the <i>Drosophila</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al tract, including the endodermal midgut and ectodermal hindgut/Malpighian tubules, maintain populations of dividing stem cells. In the midgut and hindgut, these stem cells originate from within larger populations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al progenitors that proliferate during the larval stage and form the adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e during metamorphosis. The origin of stem cells found in the excretory Malpighian tubules (‘renal stem cells’) has not been established. In this paper, we investigate the migration patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al progenitors that take place during metamorphosis. Our data demonstrate that a subset of adult midgut progenitors (AMPs) move posteriorly to form the adult ureters and, consecutively, the renal stem cells. Inhibiting cell migration by AMP-directed expression of a dominant-negative form of Rac1 protein results in the absence of stem cells in the Malpighian tubules. As the majority of the hindgut progenitor cells migrate posteriorly and differentiate into hindgut enterocytes, a group of the progenitor cells, unexpectedly, invades anteriorly into the midgut territory. Consequently, these progenitor cells differentiate into midgut enterocytes. The midgut determinant <i>GATAe</i> is required for the differentiation of midgut enterocytes derived from hindgut progenitors. Wingless signaling acts to balance the proportion of hindgut progenitors that differentiate as midgut versus hindgut enterocytes. Our findings indicate that a stable boundary between midgut and hindgut/Malpighian tubules is not established during early embryonic development; instead, pluripotent progenitor populations cross in between these organs in both directions, and are able to adopt the fate of the organ in which they come to reside.</p>

<i>C1orf106</i> is a colitis risk gene that regulates stability of epithelial adherens junctions
<p>Polymorphisms in <i>C1orf106</i> are associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the function of C1orf106 and the consequences of disease-associated polymorphisms are unknown. Here we demonstrate that C1orf106 regulates adherens junction stability by regulating the degradation of cytohesin-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that controls activation of ARF6. By limiting cytohesin-1–dependent ARF6 activation, C1orf106 stabilizes adherens junctions. Consistent with this model, <i>C1orf106</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice exhibit defects in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al epithelial cell barrier, a phenotype observed in IBD patients that confers increased susceptibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al pathogens.

CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> mononuclear phagocytes control immunity to intestinal fungi
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al fungi are an important component of the microbiota, and recent studies have unveiled their potential in modulating host immune homeostasis and inflammatory disease. Nonetheless, the mechanisms governing immunity to gut fungal communities (mycobiota) remain unknown.

Recurrent infection progressively disables host protection against intestinal inflammation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al inflammation is the central pathological feature of colitis and the inflammatory bowel diseases.

We found that recurrent nonlethal gastric infections of Gram-negative <i>Salmonella enterica</i> Typhimurium (ST), a major source of human food poisoning, caused inflammation of murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al tissue, predominantly the colon, which persisted after pathogen clearance and irreversibly escalated in severity with repeated infections. ST progressively disabled a host mechanism of protection by inducing endogenous neuraminidase activity, which accelerated the molecular aging and clearance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al alkaline phosphatase (IAP). Disease was linked to a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–dependent mechanism of IAP desialylation with accumulation of the IAP substrate and TLR4 ligand, lipopolysaccharide-phosphate. The administration of IAP or the antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir was therapeutic by maintaining IAP abundance and function.</p>

Paneth cells secrete lysozyme via secretory autophagy during bacterial infection of the intestine
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al Paneth cells limit bacterial invasion by secreting antimicrobial proteins, including lysozyme. However, invasive pathogens can disrupt the Golgi apparatus, interfering with secretion and compromising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al antimicrobial defense. Here we show that during bacterial infection, lysozyme is rerouted via secretory autophagy, an autophagy-based alternative secretion pathway. Secretory autophagy was triggered in Paneth cells by bacteria-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, required extrinsic signals from innate lymphoid cells, and limited bacterial dissemination. Secretory autophagy was disrupted in Paneth cells of mice harboring a mutation in autophagy gene <i>Atg16L1</i> that confers increased risk for Crohn’s disease in humans. Our findings identify a role for secretory autophagy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al defense and suggest why Crohn’s disease is associated with genetic mutations that affect both the ER stress response and autophagy.</p>

Sara endosomes and the asymmetric division of intestinal stem cells
<p>Tissue homeostasis is maintained by adult stem cells, which self-renew and give rise to differentiating cells.

In the adult <i>Drosophila</i> midgut, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al stem cell (ISC) divides to generate a new ISC and an enteroblast (EB) differentiating daughter. Notch signalling activity restricted to the EB regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al cell fate decision.

GPR35 promotes glycolysis, proliferation, and oncogenic signaling by engaging with the sodium potassium pump
<p>The sodium potassium pump (Na/K-ATPase) ensures the electrochemical gradient of a cell through an energy-dependent process that consumes about one-third of regenerated ATP. We report that the G protein–coupled receptor GPR35 interacted with the α chain of Na/K-ATPase and promotes its ion transport and Src signaling activity in a ligand-independent manner. Deletion of Gpr35 increased baseline Ca<sup>2+</sup> to maximal levels and reduced Src activation and overall metabolic activity in macrophages and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al epithelial cells (IECs). In contrast, a common T108M polymorphism in GPR35 was hypermorphic and had the opposite effects to Gpr35 deletion on Src activation and metabolic activity. The T108M polymorphism is associated with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, inflammatory diseases with a high cancer risk. GPR35 promoted homeostatic IEC turnover, whereas Gpr35 deletion or inhibition by a selective pepducin prevented inflammation-associated and spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al tumorigenesis in mice. Thus, GPR35 acts as a central signaling and metabolic pacesetter, which reveals an unexpected role of Na/K-ATPase in macrophage and IEC biology.</p>

URI is required to maintain intestinal architecture during ionizing radiation

URI overexpression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e protects mice from radiation-induced GIS, whereas halving URI expression sensitizes mice to IR.

URI reduction activates β-catenin–induced c-MYC expression, causing proliferation of and DNA damage to LR cells, rendering them radiosensitive. Therefore, URI labels LR cells which promote tissue regeneration in response to high-dose irradiation, and c-MYC inhibitors could be countermeasures for humans at risk of developing GIS.</p>

High-fructose corn syrup enhances intestinal tumor growth in mice

A <i>LIMA1</i> variant promotes low plasma LDL cholesterol and decreases intestinal cholesterol absorption
<p>A high concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

We identified a rare frameshift variant in the <i>LIMA1</i> (also known as <i>EPLIN</i> or <i>SREBP3</i>) gene from a Chinese family of Kazakh ethnicity with inherited low LDL-C and reduced cholesterol absorption. In a mouse model, LIMA1 was mainly expressed in the small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e and localized on the brush border membrane.

β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor–mediated negative regulation of group 2 innate lymphoid cell responses

Collectively, these data provide the first evidence of a neuronal-derived regulatory circuit that limits ILC2-dependent type 2 inflammation.</p>

<p>The small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e contains CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8αα<sup>+</sup> double-positive intraepithelial lymphocytes (DP IELs), which originate from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells through down-regulation of the transcription factor Thpok and have regulatory functions. DP IELs are absent in germ-free mice, which suggests that their differentiation depends on microbial factors. We found that DP IEL numbers in mice varied in different vivaria, correlating with the presence of <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i>. This species induced DP IELs in germ-free mice and conventionally-raised mice lacking these cells. <i>L. reuteri</i> did not shape the DP-IEL-TCR (TCR, T cell receptor) repertoire but generated indole derivatives of tryptophan that activated the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, allowing Thpok down-regulation and differentiation into DP IELs. Thus, <i>L. reuteri</i>, together with a tryptophan-rich diet, can reprogram intraepithelial CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into immunoregulatory T cells.</p>

Reovirus infection triggers inflammatory responses to dietary antigens and development of celiac disease
<p>Viral infections have been proposed to elicit pathological processes leading to the initiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) immunity against dietary gluten and celiac disease (CeD). To test this hypothesis and gain insights into mechanisms underlying virus-induced loss of tolerance to dietary antigens, we developed a viral infection model that makes use of two reovirus strains that infect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e but differ in their immunopathological outcomes. Reovirus is an avirulent pathogen that elicits protective immunity, but we discovered that it can nonetheless disrupt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al immune homeostasis at inductive and effector sites of oral tolerance by suppressing peripheral regulatory T cell (pT<sub>reg</sub>) conversion and promoting T<sub>H</sub>1 immunity to dietary antigen. Initiation of T<sub>H</sub>1 immunity to dietary antigen was dependent on interferon regulatory factor 1 and dissociated from suppression of pT<sub>reg</sub> conversion, which was mediated by type-1 interferon. Last, our study in humans supports a role for infection with reovirus, a seemingly innocuous virus, in triggering the development of CeD.</p>

Host cell attachment elicits posttranscriptional regulation in infecting enteropathogenic bacteria
<p>The mechanisms by which pathogens sense the host and respond by remodeling gene expression are poorly understood. Enteropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (EPEC), the cause of severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al infection, employs a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al epithelial cells. These effectors subvert host cell processes to promote bacterial colonization. We show that the T3SS also functions to sense the host cell and to trigger in response posttranscriptional remodeling of gene expression in the bacteria. We further show that upon effector injection, the effector-bound chaperone (CesT), which remains in the EPEC cytoplasm, antagonizes the posttranscriptional regulator CsrA. The CesT-CsrA interaction provokes reprogramming of expression of virulence and metabolic genes. This regulation is likely required for the pathogen’s adaptation to life on the epithelium surface.</p>

A pathogenic role for T cell–derived IL-22BP in inflammatory bowel disease
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al inflammation can impair mucosal healing, thereby establishing a vicious cycle leading to chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the signaling networks driving chronic inflammation remain unclear. Here we report that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from patients with IBD produce high levels of interleukin-22 binding protein (IL-22BP), the endogenous inhibitor of the tissue-protective cytokine IL-22. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that IBD development requires T cell–derived IL-22BP. Lastly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from IBD patients responsive to treatment with antibodies against tumor necrosis factor–α (anti–TNF-α), the most effective known IBD therapy, exhibited reduced amounts of IL-22BP expression but still expressed IL-22. Our findings suggest that anti–TNF-α therapy may act at least in part by suppressing IL-22BP and point toward a more specific potential therapy for IBD.</p>

A secreted bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolase enhances tolerance to enteric pathogens
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al microbiome modulates host susceptibility to enteric pathogens, but the specific protective factors and mechanisms of individual bacterial species are not fully characterized. We show that secreted antigen A (SagA) from <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> is sufficient to protect <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> against <i>Salmonella</i> pathogenesis by promoting pathogen tolerance. The NlpC/p60 peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of SagA is required and generates muramyl-peptide fragments that are sufficient to protect <i>C. elegans</i> against <i>Salmonella</i> pathogenesis in a <i>tol-1</i>–dependent manner. SagA can also be heterologously expressed and secreted to improve the protective activity of probiotics against <i>Salmonella</i> pathogenesis in <i>C. elegans</i> and mice. Our study highlights how protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al bacteria can modify microbial-associated molecular patterns to enhance pathogen tolerance.</p>

Global mRNA polarization regulates translation efficiency in the intestinal epithelium
<p>Asymmetric messenger RNA (mRNA) localization facilitates efficient translation in cells such as neurons and fibroblasts. However, the extent and importance of mRNA polarization in epithelial tissues are unclear. Here, we used single-molecule transcript imaging and subcellular transcriptomics to uncover global apical-basal intracellular polarization of mRNA in the mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al epithelium. The localization of mRNAs did not generally overlap protein localization. Instead, ribosomes were more abundant on the apical sides, and apical transcripts were consequently more efficiently translated. Refeeding of fasted mice elicited a basal-to-apical shift in polarization of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, which was associated with a specific boost in their translation. This led to increased protein production, required for efficient nutrient absorption. These findings reveal a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism involving dynamic polarization of mRNA and polarized translation.</p>

Inflammation by way of macrophage metabolism
<p>Although inflammation is an essential component of immunity, an excessive response can lead to tissue damage and autoimmune pathologies. In most cases, this is avoided with parallel, integrated regulatory responses that allow healing to commence. A central mediator of this regulatory response is the cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). IL-10 is particularly important in mucosal tissues, such as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>e, where it limits macrophage proinflammatory functions. On page 513 of this issue, Ip <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report that IL-10 alters macrophage function by promoting the clearance of damaged mitochondria and modulating cellular metabolism to limit inflammation.</p>

Neonatal acquisition of <i>Clostridia</i> species protects against colonization by bacterial pathogens
<p>The high susceptibility of neonates to infections has been assumed to be due to immaturity of the immune system, but the mechanism remains unclear. By colonizing adult germ-free mice with the cecal contents of neonatal and adult mice, we show that the neonatal microbiota is unable to prevent colonization by two bacterial pathogens that cause mortality in neonates. The lack of colonization resistance occurred when Clostridiales were absent in the neonatal microbiota. Administration of Clostridiales, but not Bacteroidales, protected neonatal mice from pathogen infection and abrogated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al pathology upon pathogen challenge. Depletion of Clostridiales also abolished colonization resistance in adult mice. The neonatal bacteria enhanced the ability of protective Clostridiales to colonize the gut.</p>

Inflammation boosts bacteriophage transfer between <i>Salmonella</i> spp.
<p>Bacteriophage transfer (lysogenic conversion) promotes bacterial virulence evolution. There is limited understanding of the factors that determine lysogenic conversion dynamics within infected hosts. A murine <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm) diarrhea model was used to study the transfer of SopEΦ, a prophage from <i>S</i>.Tm SL1344, to <i>S</i>.Tm ATCC14028S. Gut inflammation and enteric disease triggered >55% lysogenic conversion of ATCC14028S within 3 days. Without inflammation, SopEΦ transfer was reduced by up to 10<sup>5</sup>-fold. This was because inflammation (e.g., reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, hypochlorite) triggers the bacterial SOS response, boosts expression of the phage antirepressor Tum, and thereby promotes free phage production and subsequent transfer. Mucosal vaccination prevented a dense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al <i>S</i>.Tm population from inducing inflammation and consequently abolished SopEΦ transfer. Vaccination may be a general strategy for blocking pathogen evolution that requires disease-driven transfer of temperate bacteriophages.</p>

A nontoxic pain killer designed by modeling of pathological receptor conformations
<p>Indiscriminate activation of opioid receptors provides pain relief but also severe central and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al side effects. We hypothesized that exploiting pathological (rather than physiological) conformation dynamics of opioid receptor-ligand interactions might yield ligands without adverse actions. By computer simulations at low pH, a hallmark of injured tissue, we designed an agonist that, because of its low acid dissociation constant, selectively activates peripheral μ-opioid receptors at the source of pain generation. Unlike the conventional opioid fentanyl, this agonist showed pH-sensitive binding, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein) subunit dissociation by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate inhibition in vitro<i>.</i> It produced injury-restricted analgesia in rats with different types of inflammatory pain without exhibiting respiratory depression, sedation, constipation, or addiction potential.</p>

Layer-specific modulation of neocortical dendritic inhibition during active wakefulness
<p>γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inputs are strategically positioned to gate synaptic integration along the dendritic arbor of pyramidal cells. However, their spatiotemporal dynamics during behavior are poorly understood. Using an optical-tagging electrophysiological approach to record and label somatostatin-expressing (Sst) interneurons (GABAergic neurons specialized for dendritic inhibition), we discovered a layer-specific modulation of their activity in behaving mice. Sst interneuron subtypes, residing in different cortical layers and innervating complementary laminar domains, exhibited opposite activity changes during transitions to active wakefulness. The relative weight of vasoactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al peptide–expressing (Vip) interneuron–mediated inhibition of distinct Sst interneurons and cholinergic modulation determined their in vivo activity. These results reveal a state-dependent laminar influence of Sst interneuron–mediated inhibition, with implications for the compartmentalized regulation of dendritic signaling in the mammalian neocortex.</p>

The DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome controls radiation-induced cell death and tissue injury
<p>Acute exposure to ionizing radiation induces massive cell death and severe damage to tissues containing actively proliferating cells, including bone marrow and the gastro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al tract. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology remain controversial. Here, we show that mice deficient in the double-stranded DNA sensor AIM2 are protected from both subtotal body irradiation–induced gastro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al syndrome and total body irradiation–induced hematopoietic failure. AIM2 mediates the caspase-1–dependent death of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intestin</span></strong>al epithelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to double-strand DNA breaks caused by ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents. Mechanistically, we found that AIM2 senses radiation-induced DNA damage in the nucleus to mediate inflammasome activation and cell death. Our results suggest that AIM2 may be a new therapeutic target for ionizing radiation exposure.</p>

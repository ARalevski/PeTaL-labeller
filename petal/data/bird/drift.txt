Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p>Proteins fold into unique native structures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity. We combined computational protein design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity for more than 15,000 de novo designed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable designed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity in uncharted protein space. Iteration between design and experiment increased the design success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where design was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity as designs became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein design into a data-driven science.</p>

Concerted Divergence after Gene Duplication in Polycomb Repressive Complexes
<p>Duplicated genes are a major contributor to genome evolution and phenotypic novelty. There are multiple possible evolutionary fates of duplicated genes. Here, we provide an example of concerted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of simultaneously duplicated genes whose products function in the same complex. We studied POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX2 (PRC2) in Brassicaceae. The VERNALIZATION (VRN)-PRC2 complex contains VRN2 and SWINGER (SWN), and both genes were duplicated during a whole-genome duplication to generate FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2) and MEDEA (MEA), which function in the Brassicaceae-specific FIS-PRC2 complex that regulates seed development. We examined the expression of <i>FIS2</i>, <i>MEA</i>, and their paralogs, compared their cytosine and histone methylation patterns, and analyzed the sequence evolution of the genes. We found that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have reproductive-specific expression patterns that are correlated and derived from the broadly expressed <i>VRN2</i> and <i>SWN</i> in outgroup species. In vegetative tissues of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), repressive methylation marks are enriched in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>, whereas active marks are associated with their paralogs. We detected comparable accelerated amino acid substitution rates in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> but not in their paralogs. We also show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence patterns of the PRC2-associated <i>VERNALIZATION5/VIN3-LIKE2</i> that are similar to <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>. These lines of evidence indicate that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed in concert, resulting in functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of the PRC2 complexes in Brassicaceae. This type of concerted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence is a previously unreported fate of duplicated genes. In addition, the Brassicaceae-specific FIS-PRC2 complex modified the regulatory pathways in female gametophyte and seed development.</p>

Packing of apolar side chains enables accurate design of highly stable membrane proteins
<p>The features that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ize the structures of membrane proteins remain poorly understood. Polar interactions contribute modestly, and the hydrophobic effect contributes little to the energetics of apolar side-chain packing in membranes. Disruption of steric packing can de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ize the native folds of membrane proteins, but is packing alone sufficient to drive folding in lipids? If so, then membrane proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized by this feature should be readily designed and structurally characterized—yet this has not been achieved. Through simulation of the natural protein phospholamban and redesign of variants, we define a steric packing code underlying its assembly. Synthetic membrane proteins designed using this code and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized entirely by apolar side chains conform to the intended fold. Although highly stable, the steric complementarity required for their folding is surprisingly stringent. Structural informatics shows that the designed packing motif recurs across the proteome, emphasizing a prominent role for precise apolar packing in membrane protein folding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ization, and evolution.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased damping leads to better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity.</p>

Near-atomic model of microtubule-tau interactions
<p>Tau is a developmentally regulated axonal protein that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izes and bundles microtubules (MTs). Its hyperphosphorylation is thought to cause detachment from MTs and subsequent aggregation into fibrils implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. It is unclear which tau residues are crucial for tau-MT interactions, where tau binds on MTs, and how it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izes them. We used cryo–electron microscopy to visualize different tau constructs on MTs and computational approaches to generate atomic models of tau-tubulin interactions. The conserved tubulin-binding repeats within tau adopt similar extended structures along the crest of the protofilament, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izing the interface between tubulin dimers. Our structures explain the effect of phosphorylation on MT affinity and lead to a model of tau repeats binding in tandem along protofilaments, tethering together tubulin dimers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izing polymerization interfaces.</p>

Perovskite solar cells with CuSCN hole extraction layers yield stabilized efficiencies greater than 20%
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with efficiencies greater than 20% have been realized only with expensive organic hole-transporting materials. We demonstrate PSCs that achieve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized efficiencies exceeding 20% with copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) as the hole extraction layer. A fast solvent removal method enabled the creation of compact, highly conformal CuSCN layers that facilitate rapid carrier extraction and collection. The PSCs showed high thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity under long-term heating, although their operational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity was poor. This in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity originated from potential-induced degradation of the CuSCN/Au contact. The addition of a conductive reduced graphene oxide spacer layer between CuSCN and gold allowed PSCs to retain >95% of their initial efficiency after aging at a maximum power point for 1000 hours under full solar intensity at 60°C. Under both continuous full-sun illumination and thermal stress, CuSCN-based devices surpassed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of spiro-OMeTAD–based PSCs.</p>

Evolutionary and Functional Analysis of Membrane-Bound NAC Transcription Factor Genes in Soybean
<p>Functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence is thought to be an important evolutionary driving force for the retention of duplicate genes. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) membrane-bound NAC transcription factor (NTL) genes. NTLs are thought to be components of stress signaling and unique in their requirement for proteolytic cleavage to free them from the membrane. Most of the 15 <i>GmNTL</i> genes appear to have evolved under strong purifying selection. By analyzing the phylogenetic tree and gene synteny, we identified seven duplicate gene pairs generated by the latest whole-genome duplication. The members of each pair were shown to have variously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed at the transcriptional (organ specificity and responsiveness to stress), posttranscriptional (alternative splicing), and protein (proteolysis-mediated membrane release and transactivation activity) levels. The dormant (full-length protein) and active (protein without a transmembrane motif) forms of one pair of duplicated gene products (GmNTL1/GmNLT11) were each separately constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The heteroexpression of active but not dormant forms of these proteins caused improved tolerance to abiotic stresses, suggesting that membrane release was required for their functionality. Arabidopsis carrying the dormant form of GmNTL1 was more tolerant to hydrogen peroxide, which induces its membrane release. Tolerance was not increased in the line carrying dormant GmNTL11, which was not released by hydrogen peroxide treatment. Thus, NTL-release pattern changes may cause phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence. It was concluded that a variety of functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ences contributed to the retention of these <i>GmNTL</i> duplicates.</p>

High Fitness Costs and Instability of Gene Duplications Reduce Rates of Evolution of New Genes by Duplication-Divergence Mechanisms
<p>An important mechanism for generation of new genes is by duplication-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of existing genes. Duplication-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence includes several different submodels, such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of neutral mutations the original function is distributed between two partially functional and complementary genes, and neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the fitness cost and genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of the duplications. Here, we determined the fitness cost and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of defined gene duplications/amplifications on a low copy number plasmid. Our experimental results show that the costs of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each additional kilo base pairs of DNA reduces fitness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene amplifications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the fitness costs and in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity strongly reduces the likelihood of both sub- and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial functions.</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural selection, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural selection on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence. It obtains information about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.</p>

Regulation of the ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of CREB-binding protein modulates histone acetylation and lung inflammation
<p>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element–binding protein (CREB)–binding protein (CBP) is a histone acetyltransferase that plays a pivotal role in the control of histone modification and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes in inflammatory diseases, including sepsis and lung injury. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXL19 targeted CBP for site-specific ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. The ubiquitylation-dependent degradation of CBP reduced the extent of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–dependent histone acetylation and cytokine release in mouse lung epithelial cells and in a mouse model of sepsis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the deubiquitylating enzyme USP14 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized CBP by reducing its ubiquitylation. LPS increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of CBP by reducing the association between CBP and FBXL19 and by activating USP14. Inhibition of USP14 reduced CBP protein abundance and attenuated LPS-stimulated histone acetylation and cytokine release. Together, our findings delineate the molecular mechanisms through which CBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity is regulated by FBXL19 and USP14, which results in the modulation of chromatin remodeling and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes.</p>

Methylammonium-free, high-performance, and stable perovskite solar cells on a planar architecture
<p>Currently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high performances greater than 20% contain bromine (Br), causing a suboptimal bandgap, and the thermally unstable methylammonium (MA) molecule. Avoiding Br and especially MA can therefore result in more optimal bandgaps and stable perovskites. We show that inorganic cation tuning, using rubidium and cesium, enables highly crystalline formamidinium-based perovskites without Br or MA. On a conventional, planar device architecture, using polymeric interlayers at the electron- and hole-transporting interface, we demonstrate an efficiency of 20.35% (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized), one of the highest for MA-free perovskites, with a drastically improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity reached without the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izing influence of mesoporous interlayers. The perovskite is not heated beyond 100°C. Going MA-free is a new direction for perovskites that are inherently stable and compatible with tandems or flexible substrates, which are the main routes commercializing PSCs.</p>

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional metals become harder with decreasing grain sizes, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship. However, this relationship fails and softening occurs at some grain sizes in the nanometer regime for some alloys. In this study, we discovered that plastic deformation mechanism of extremely fine nanograined metals and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring grain boundary (GB) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity. The electrodeposited nanograined nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for grain sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh hardness is achieved in the nanograined samples with a plastic deformation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations. Grain boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity provides an alternative dimension, in addition to grain size, for producing novel nanograined metals with extraordinary properties.</p>

Low Water Potential and At14a-Like1 (AFL1) Effects on Endocytosis and Actin Filament Organization
<p>At14a-Like1 (AFL1) is a stress-induced protein of unknown function that promotes growth during low water potential stress and drought. Previous analysis indicated that AFL1 may have functions related to endocytosis and regulation of actin filament organization, processes for which the effects of low water potential are little known. We found that low water potential led to a decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the membrane-impermeable dye FM4-64. Ectopic expression of AFL1 reversed the decrease in FM4-64 uptake seen in wild type, while reduced AFL1 expression led to further inhibition of FM4-64 uptake. Increased AFL1 also made FM4-64 uptake less sensitive to the actin filament disruptor Latrunculin B (LatB). LatB decreased AFL1-Clathrin Light Chain colocalization, further indicating that effects of AFL1 on endocytosis may be related to actin filament organization or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic AFL1 expression made actin filaments less sensitive to disruption by LatB or Cytochalasin D and led to increased actin filament skewness and decreased occupancy, indicative of more bundled actin filaments. This latter effect could be partially mimicked by the actin filament <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izer Jasplakinolide (JASP). However, AFL1 did not substantially inhibit actin filament dynamics, indicating that AFL1 acts via a different mechanism than JASP-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ization. AFL1 partially colocalized with actin filaments but not with microtubules, further indicating actin-filament–related function of AFL1.

RECX Interacts with Mitochondrial RECA to Maintain Mitochondrial Genome Stability
<p>The chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes are essential for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. RECA and RECG, which are plant-specific homologs of the bacterial homologous recombination repair proteins RecA and RecG, maintain organelle genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats (SDRs) in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. In this study, we analyzed the plant-specific factor RECX, a homolog of bacterial RecX that regulates RecA. RECX fused to GFP colocalized with mitochondrial RECA1 and chloroplast RECA2 on mitochondrial and chloroplast nucleoids, respectively. Knockout (KO) and overexpression (OEX) of <i>RECX</i> did not alter the <i>P. patens</i> morphological phenotype. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, however, showed that products from recombination between SDRs increased significantly in <i>RECX</i> OEX mitochondria and modestly in <i>RECX</i> KO mitochondria. By contrast, analysis of chloroplast DNA revealed no substantial alteration in the number of products from recombination between SDRs in <i>RECX</i> KO and OEX chloroplasts. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed interactions between RECX and RECA1 and between RECX and RECA2. Expression profiles showed a positive correlation between <i>RECX</i> and factors maintaining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of both organelle genomes and <i>RECA1</i>. Collectively, these results suggest that RECX maintains mitochondrial genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity, likely by modulating RECA1 activity, and that the compromised function of RECX induces mitochondrial genome in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity.</p>

An E3 Ligase Affects the NLR Receptor Stability and Immunity to Powdery Mildew
<p>Following the detection of pathogen cognate effectors, plant Nod-like receptors (NLRs) trigger isolate-specific immunity that is generally associated with cell death. The regulation of NLR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity is important to ensure effective immunity. In barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the allelic Mildew locus A (MLA) receptors mediate isolate-specific disease resistance against powdery mildew fungus (<i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>). Currently, how MLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity is controlled remains unknown. Here, we identified an MLA-interacting RING-type E3 ligase, MIR1, that interacts with several MLAs. We showed that the carboxyl-terminal TPR domain of MIR1 mediates the interaction with the coiled-coil domain-containing region of functional MLAs, such as MLA1, MLA6, and MLA10, but not with that of the nonfunctional MLA18-1. MIR1 can ubiquitinate the amino-terminal region of MLAs in vitro and promotes the proteasomal degradation of MLAs in vitro and in planta. Both proteasome inhibitor treatment and virus-induced gene silencing-mediated <i>MIR1</i> silencing significantly increased MLA abundance in barley transgenic lines. Furthermore, overexpression of MIR1 specifically compromised MLA-mediated disease resistance in barley, while coexpression of MIR1 and MLA10 attenuated MLA10-induced cell death signaling in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Together, our data reveal a mechanism for the control of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of MLA immune receptors and for the attenuation of MLA-triggered defense signaling by a RING-type E3 ligase via the ubiquitin proteasome system.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional differentiation of sex chromosomes and is thus a crucial step in the process of sex chromosome evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different sex chromosome system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y chromosome and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of sex chromosomes based on comparative analyses of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both chromosome-wide differentiation patterns and phylogenetic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral sex chromosomes were extensively differentiated before the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of these lineages. In contrast, genetic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-sex chromosomes. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-sex chromosomes. Chromosomal regions exhibiting genetic differentiation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-sex chromosomes, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of sex chromosome differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of sex chromosome evolution.</p>

Evolutionary drivers of thermoadaptation in enzyme catalysis
<p>With early life likely to have existed in a hot environment, enzymes had to cope with an inherent drop in catalytic speed caused by lowered temperature. Here we characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying thermoadaptation of enzyme catalysis in adenylate kinase using ancestral sequence reconstruction spanning 3 billion years of evolution. We show that evolution solved the enzyme’s key kinetic obstacle—how to maintain catalytic speed on a cooler Earth—by exploiting transition-state heat capacity. Tracing the evolution of enzyme activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity from the hot-start toward modern hyperthermophilic, mesophilic, and psychrophilic organisms illustrates active pressure versus passive drift in evolution on a molecular level, refutes the debated activity/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity trade-off, and suggests that the catalytic speed of adenylate kinase is an evolutionary driver for organismal fitness.</p>

Ecological speciation of bacteriophage lambda in allopatry and sympatry
<p>Understanding the conditions that allow speciation to occur is difficult because most research has focused on either long-lived organisms or asexual microorganisms. We propagated bacteriophage λ, a virus with rapid generations and frequent recombination, on two <i>Escherichia coli</i> host genotypes that expressed either the LamB or OmpF receptor. When supplied with either single host (allopatry), phage λ improved its binding to the available receptor while losing its ability to use the alternative. When evolving on both hosts together (sympatry), the viruses split into two lineages with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent receptor preferences. Although the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence varied among replicates, some lineages evolved reproductive isolation via genetic incompatibilities. This outcome indicates that, under suitable conditions, allopatric and sympatric speciation can occur with similar ease.</p>

Robust spin-polarized midgap states at step edges of topological crystalline insulators
<p>Topological crystalline insulators are materials in which the crystalline symmetry leads to topologically protected surface states with a chiral spin texture, rendering them potential candidates for spintronics applications. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we uncover the existence of one-dimensional (1D) midgap states at odd-atomic surface step edges of the three-dimensional topological crystalline insulator (Pb,Sn)Se. A minimal toy model and realistic tight-binding calculations identify them as spin-polarized flat bands connecting two Dirac points. This nontrivial origin provides the 1D midgap states with inherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity and protects them from backscattering. We experimentally show that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity results in a striking robustness to defects, strong magnetic fields, and elevated temperature.</p>

The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase RHA2b Promotes Degradation of MYB30 in Abscisic Acid Signaling
<p>The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical for plants encountering abiotic stress. We reported previously that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transcription factor MYB30 participates in ABA responses via SUMO ligase SAP-MIZ Domain-Containing SIZ1-mediated sumoylation. Here, we show that the RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase RHA2b, which positively regulates ABA signaling, interacted with and ubiquitinated MYB30 to modulate MYB30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity through the 26S proteasome pathway. The degradation rate of MYB30 was repressed significantly in the <i>rha2b-1</i> mutant. Phenotypic analyses showed that <i>MYB30</i> acts genetically downstream of <i>RHA2b</i> in ABA signaling. Substitutions of lysine-283 (K283) and K165 blocked ubiquitination, suggesting that these residues are sites of ubiquitination. K283 residue substitution significantly inhibited the degradation of MYB30 induced by ABA. The K165 site functioned additively with K283 in ABA-induced MYB30 degradation and ABA responses. At the same time, sumoylation protected MYB30 from degradation under cycloheximide and ABA treatment. Compared with MYB30, overexpression of MYB30-SUMO1 partially recovered the ABA sensitivity of <i>siz1-2</i>. But MYB30-SUMO1 exhibited similar localization with MYB30 in nuclei. Overall, our results suggest that RHA2b targets MYB30 for degradation to modulate ABA signaling. Considering that the K283 residue also is the major site for sumoylation, we propose that sumoylation and ubiquitination act antagonistically in the ABA response to regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of MYB30 by occupying the same residue.</p>

Two Tabersonine 6,7-Epoxidases Initiate Lochnericine-Derived Alkaloid Biosynthesis in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>
<p>Lochnericine is a major monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) in the roots of Madagascar periwinkle (<i>Catharanthus roseus</i>). Lochnericine is derived from the stereoselective C6,C7-epoxidation of tabersonine and can be metabolized further to generate other complex MIAs. While the enzymes responsible for its downstream modifications have been characterized, those involved in lochnericine biosynthesis remain unknown. By combining gene correlation studies, functional assays, and transient gene inactivation, we identified two highly conserved P450s that efficiently catalyze the epoxidation of tabersonine: tabersonine 6,7-epoxidase isoforms 1 and 2 (TEX1 and TEX2). Both proteins are quite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent from the previously characterized tabersonine 2,3-epoxidase and are more closely related to tabersonine 16-hydroxylase, involved in vindoline biosynthesis in leaves. Biochemical characterization of TEX1/2 revealed their strict substrate specificity for tabersonine and their inability to epoxidize 19-hydroxytabersonine, indicating that they catalyze the first step in the pathway leading to horhammericine production. <i>TEX1</i> and <i>TEX2</i> displayed complementary expression profiles, with <i>TEX1</i> expressed mainly in roots and <i>TEX2</i> in aerial organs. Our results suggest that <i>TEX1</i> and <i>TEX2</i> originated from a gene duplication event and later acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent, organ-specific regulatory elements for lochnericine biosynthesis throughout the plant, as supported by the presence of lochnericine in flowers. Finally, through the sequential expression of <i>TEX1</i> and up to four other MIA biosynthetic genes in yeast, we reconstituted the 19-acetylhorhammericine biosynthetic pathway and produced tailor-made MIAs by mixing enzymatic modules that are naturally spatially separated in the plant. These results lay the groundwork for the metabolic engineering of tabersonine/lochnericine derivatives of pharmaceutical interest.</p>

PROHIBITIN3 Forms Complexes with ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 to Regulate Stress-Induced Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a major defense signal in plants. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the chloroplast-localized isochorismate pathway is the main source of SA biosynthesis during abiotic stress or pathogen infections. In the first step of the pathway, the enzyme ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 (ICS1) converts chorismate to isochorismate. An unknown enzyme subsequently converts isochorismate to SA. Here, we show that ICS1 protein levels increase during UV-C stress. To identify proteins that may play roles in SA production by regulating ICS1, we analyzed proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with ICS1 via mass spectrometry. The ICS1 complexes contained a large number of peptides from the PROHIBITIN (PHB) protein family, with PHB3 the most abundant. PHB proteins have diverse biological functions that include acting as scaffolds for protein complex formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ization. PHB3 was reported previously to localize to mitochondria. Using fractionation, protease protection, and live imaging, we show that PHB3 also localizes to chloroplasts, where ICS1 resides. Notably, loss of PHB3 function led to decreased ICS1 protein levels in response to UV-C stress. However, <i>ICS1</i> transcript levels remain unchanged, indicating that ICS1 is regulated posttranscriptionally. The <i>phb3</i> mutant displayed reduced levels of SA, the SA-regulated protein PR1, and hypersensitive cell death in response to UV-C and avirulent strains of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and, correspondingly, supported increased growth of <i>P. syringae</i>. The expression of a <i>PHB3</i> transgene in the <i>phb3</i> mutant complemented all of these phenotypes. We suggest a model in which the formation of PHB3-ICS1 complexes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izes ICS1 to promote SA production in response to stress.</p>

Parental DNA Methylation States Are Associated with Heterosis in Epigenetic Hybrids
<p>Despite the importance and wide exploitation of heterosis in commercial crop breeding, the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not completely understood. Recent studies have implicated changes in DNA methylation and small RNAs in hybrid performance; however, it remains unclear whether epigenetic changes are a cause or a consequence of heterosis. Here, we analyze a large panel of over 500 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) epigenetic hybrid plants (epiHybrids), which we derived from near-isogenic but epigenetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent parents. This proof-of-principle experimental system allowed us to quantify the contribution of parental methylation differences to heterosis. We measured traits such as leaf area, growth rate, flowering time, main stem branching, rosette branching, and final plant height and observed several strong positive and negative heterotic phenotypes among the epiHybrids. Using an epigenetic quantitative trait locus mapping approach, we were able to identify specific differentially methylated regions in the parental genomes that are associated with hybrid performance. Sequencing of methylomes, transcriptomes, and genomes of selected parent-epiHybrid combinations further showed that these parental differentially methylated regions most likely mediate the remodeling of methylation and transcriptional states at specific loci in the hybrids. Taken together, our data suggest that locus-specific epigenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence between the parental lines can directly or indirectly trigger heterosis in Arabidopsis hybrids independent of genetic changes. These results add to a growing body of evidence that points to epigenetic factors as one of the key determinants of hybrid performance.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In addition, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity decreased in response to ATP addition in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon addition of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Phosphorylation of Arabidopsis MAP Kinase Phosphatase 1 (MKP1) Is Required for PAMP Responses and Resistance against Bacteria
<p>Plants perceive potential pathogens via the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized pattern recognition receptors, which initiates a series of intracellular responses that ultimately limit bacterial growth. PAMP responses include changes in intracellular protein phosphorylation, including the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), such as Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MKP1, are important negative regulators of MAPKs and play a crucial role in controlling the intensity and duration of MAPK activation during innate immune signaling. As such, the <i>mkp1</i> mutant lacking MKP1 displays enhanced PAMP responses and resistance against the virulent bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. Previous in vitro studies showed that MKP1 can be phosphorylated and activated by MPK6, suggesting that phosphorylation may be an important mechanism for regulating MKP1. We found that MKP1 was phosphorylated during PAMP elicitation and that phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized the protein, resulting in protein accumulation after elicitation. MKP1 also can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that MKP1 is constitutively degraded through the proteasome in the resting state. In addition, we investigated the role of MKP1 posttranslational regulation in plant defense by testing whether phenotypes of the <i>mkp1</i> Arabidopsis mutant could be complemented by expressing phosphorylation site mutations of MKP1. The phosphorylation of MKP1 was found to be required for some, but not all, of MKP1’s functions in PAMP responses and defense against bacteria. Together, our results provide insight into the roles of phosphorylation in the regulation of MKP1 during PAMP signaling and resistance to bacteria.</p>

The RING-Type E3 Ligase XBAT35.2 Is Involved in Cell Death Induction and Pathogen Response
<p>XBAT35 belongs to a subfamily of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RING-type E3s that are similar in domain architecture to the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) XA21 Binding Protein3, a defense protein. The <i>XBAT35</i> transcript undergoes alternative splicing to produce two protein isoforms, XBAT35.1 and XBAT35.2. Here, we demonstrate that XBAT35.2 localizes predominantly to the Golgi and is involved in cell death induction and pathogen response. XBAT35.2, but not XBAT35.1, was found to trigger cell death when overexpressed in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and does so in a manner that requires its RING domain. Loss of <i>XBAT35</i> gene function disrupts the plant’s ability to defend against pathogen attack, whereas overexpression of <i>XBAT35.2</i> enhances resistance to pathogens. XBAT35.2 was found to be unstable and promotes its own degradation, suggesting self-regulation. Inoculation with virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 results in a drastic reduction in the levels of ubiquitinated XBAT35.2 and an increase in the abundance of the E3. This implies that pathogen infection prohibits XBAT35.2 self-regulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izes the E3. In agreement with a role in defending against pathogens, XBAT35.2 interacts with defense-related Accelerated Cell Death11 (ACD11) in planta and promotes the proteasome-dependent turnover of ACD11 in cell-free degradation assays. In accordance with regulation by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized XBAT35.2, the levels of ubiquitinated ACD11 increased considerably, and the abundance of ACD11 was reduced following pathogen infection. In addition, treatment of transgenic seedlings with a proteasome inhibitor results in the accumulation of ACD11, confirming proteasome-dependent degradation. Collectively, these results highlight a novel role for XBAT35.2 in cell death induction and defense against pathogens.</p>

Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and metabolism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the rotation of the planet. Photosynthesis is a key metabolic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of photosynthesis, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from photosynthesis also feeds back to regulate the circadian oscillator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian oscillator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian oscillator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of circadian oscillator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i>
<p>The phytohormone auxin regulates many aspects of growth and development in land plants, but the origin and evolution of auxin signaling and response mechanisms remain largely unknown. Indeed, it remains to be investigated whether auxin-related pathways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed before the emergence of land plants. To address this knowledge deficit, we analyzed auxin responses in the charophyte alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i> NIES-2285, whose ancestor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed from a green algal ancestor during the evolution of land plants. This strain is the same as <i>Klebsormidium flaccidum</i> NIES-2285, for which the draft genome was sequenced in 2014, and was taxonomically reclassified as <i>K. nitens</i>. This genome sequence revealed genes involved in auxin responses. Furthermore, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was detected in cultures of <i>K. nitens</i>, but <i>K. nitens</i> lacks the central regulators of the canonical auxin-signaling pathway found in land plants. Exogenous IAA inhibited cell division and cell elongation in <i>K. nitens</i>. Inhibitors of auxin biosynthesis and of polar auxin transport also inhibited cell division and elongation. Moreover, exogenous IAA rapidly induced expression of a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN transcription factor. These results suggest that <i>K. nitens</i> has acquired the part of the auxin system that regulates transcription and cell growth without the requirement for the central players that govern auxin signaling in land plants.</p>

A Plant Cryptochrome Controls Key Features of the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Circadian Clock and Its Life Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-binding proteins that act as blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects and are components of the circadian oscillator in mammals. Animal and plant cryptochromes are evolutionarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent, although the unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas</i> throughout) has both an animal-like cryptochrome and a plant cryptochrome (pCRY; formerly designated CPH1). Here, we show that the pCRY protein accumulates at night as part of a complex. Functional characterization of pCRY was performed based on an insertional mutant that expresses only 11% of the wild-type pCRY level. The <i>pcry</i> mutant is defective for central properties of the circadian clock. In the mutant, the period is lengthened significantly, ultimately resulting in arrhythmicity, while blue light-based phase shifts show large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deviat</span></strong>ions from what is observed in wild-type cells. We also show that pCRY is involved in gametogenesis in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. pCRY is down-regulated in pregametes and gametes, and in the <i>pcry</i> mutant, there is altered transcript accumulation under blue light of the strictly light-dependent, gamete-specific gene <i>GAS28</i>. pCRY acts as a negative regulator for the induction of mating ability in the light and for the loss of mating ability in the dark. Moreover, pCRY is necessary for light-dependent germination, during which the zygote undergoes meiosis that gives rise to four vegetative cells. In sum, our data demonstrate that pCRY is a key blue light receptor in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> that is involved in both circadian timing and life cycle progression.</p>

Hierarchically Aligning 10 Legume Genomes Establishes a Family-Level Genomics Platform
<p>Mainly due to their economic importance, genomes of 10 legumes, including soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), wild peanut (<i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis ipaensis</i>), and barrel medic (<i>Medicago truncatula</i>), have been sequenced. However, a family-level comparative genomics analysis has been unavailable. With grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and selected legume genomes as outgroups, we managed to perform a hierarchical and event-related alignment of these genomes and deconvoluted layers of homologous regions produced by ancestral polyploidizations or speciations. Consequently, we illustrated genomic fractionation characterized by widespread gene losses after the polyploidizations. Notably, high similarity in gene retention between recently duplicated chromosomes in soybean supported the likely autopolyploidy nature of its tetraploid ancestor. Moreover, although most gene losses were nearly random, largely but not fully described by geometric distribution, we showed that polyploidization contributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ently to the copy number variation of important gene families. Besides, we showed significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent evolutionary levels among legumes and, by performing synonymous nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites correction, redated major evolutionary events during their expansion. This effort laid a solid foundation for further genomics exploration in the legume research community and beyond. We describe only a tiny fraction of legume comparative genomics analysis that we performed; more information was stored in the newly constructed Legume Comparative Genomics Research Platform (<ext-link>www.legumegrp.org</ext-link>).</p>

A SUMO Ligase AtMMS21 Regulates the Stability of the Chromatin Remodeler BRAHMA in Root Development
<p>Chromatin remodeling is essential for gene expression regulation in plant development and response to stresses. Brahma (BRM) is a conserved ATPase in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and is involved in various biological processes in plant cells, but the regulation mechanism on BRM protein remains unclear. Here, we report that BRM interacts with AtMMS21, a SUMO ligase in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The interaction was confirmed in different approaches in vivo and in vitro. The mutants of <i>BRM</i> and <i>AtMMS21</i> displayed a similar defect in root development. In the <i>mms21-1</i> mutant, the protein level of BRM-GFP was significantly lower than that in wild type, but the RNA level of <i>BRM</i> did not change. Biochemical evidence indicated that BRM was modified by SUMO3, and the reaction was enhanced by AtMMS21. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type AtMMS21 but not the mutated AtMMS21 without SUMO ligase activity was able to recover the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of BRM in <i>mms21-1</i>. Overexpression of <i>BRM</i> in <i>mms21-1</i> partially rescued the developmental defect of roots. Taken together, these results supported that AtMMS21 regulates the protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of BRM in root development.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, genetically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of genes is an extreme instance of gene expression complementation, in which genes are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 genes only expressed in B73 and 2,024 genes only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded the number of active genes in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic genes that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE genes. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic genes among SPE patterns and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity under water limitation might suggest a function of these genes during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-genome sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-genome sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage genome sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque genome, we identified approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE genomes. Some genes carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease genes. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related genes carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. Genome-wide genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM genome, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the genome) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on genome-wide data.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deviat</span></strong>ions at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deviat</span></strong>ions from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p>Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation’s effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational effects on protein thermodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

The Evolution of Male–Female Sexual Dimorphism Predates the Gender-Based Divergence of the Mating Locus Gene <i>MAT3/RB</i>
<p>The molecular bases for the evolution of male–female sexual dimorphism are possible to study in volvocine algae because they encompass the entire range of reproductive morphologies from isogamy to oogamy. In 1978, Charlesworth suggested the model of a gamete size gene becoming linked to the sex-determining or mating type locus (<i>MT</i>) as a mechanism for the evolution of anisogamy. Here, we carried out the first comprehensive study of a candidate <i>MT-</i>linked oogamy gene, <i>MAT3/RB</i>, across the volvocine lineage. We found that evolution of anisogamy/oogamy predates the extremely high male–female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of <i>MAT3</i> that characterizes the <i>Volvox carteri</i> lineage. These data demonstrate very little sex-linked sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of <i>MAT3</i> between the two sexes in other volvocine groups, though linkage between <i>MAT3</i> and the mating locus appears to be conserved. These data implicate genetic determinants other than or in addition to <i>MAT3</i> in the evolution of anisogamy in volvocine algae.</p>

Evolution of Ancient Functions in the Vertebrate Insulin-Like Growth Factor System Uncovered by Study of Duplicated Salmonid Fish Genomes
<p>Whole-genome duplication (WGD) was experienced twice by the vertebrate ancestor (2 rounds; 2R), again by the teleost fish ancestor (3R) and most recently in certain teleost lineages (4R). Consequently, vertebrate gene families are often expanded in 3R and 4R genomes. Arguably, many types of “functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence” present across 2R gene families will exceed that between 3R/4R paralogs of genes comprising 2R families. Accordingly, 4R offers a form of replication of 2R. Examining whether this concept has implications for molecular evolutionary research, we studied insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins (IGFBPs), whose six 2R family members carry IGF hormones and regulate interactions between IGFs and IGF1-receptors (IGF1Rs). Using phylogenomic approaches, we resolved the complete IGFBP repertoire of 4R-derived salmonid fishes (19 genes; 13 more than human) and established evolutionary relationships/nomenclature with respect to WGDs. Traits central to IGFBP action were determined for all genes, including atomic interactions in IGFBP–IGF1/IGF2 complexes regulating IGF–IGF1R binding. Using statistical methods, we demonstrate that attributes of these protein interfaces are overwhelming a product of 2R IGFBP family membership, explain 49–68% of variation in <i>IGFBP</i> mRNA concentration in several different tissues, and strongly predict the strength and direction of <i>IGFBP</i> transcriptional regulation under differing nutritional states. The results support a model where vertebrate IGFBP family members evolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent structural attributes to provide distinct competition for IGFs with IGF1Rs, predisposing different functions in the regulation of IGF signaling. Evolution of gene expression then acted to ensure the appropriate physiological production of IGFBPs according to their structural specializations, leading to optimal IGF-signaling according to nutritional-status and the endocrine/local mode of action. This study demonstrates that relatively recent gene family expansion can facilitate inference of functional evolution within ancient genetic systems.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Dislocation of a primary total hip arthroplasty is more common in patients with a lumbar spinal fusion

The challenge of Monteggia-like lesions of the elbow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this retrospective multicentre study was to evaluate   mid-term results of the operative treatment of Monteggia-like lesions   and to determine the prognostic factors that influence the clinical   and radiological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients (27 women and 19 men), with a mean age   of 57.7 years (18 to 84) who had sustained a Monteggia-like lesion   were followed up clinically and radiologically after surgical treatment.   The Mayo Modified Wrist Score (MMWS), Mayo Elbow Performance Score   (MEPS), Broberg and Morrey Score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (DASH) score were used for evaluation at a mean of 65 months   (27 to 111) postoperatively. All ulnar fractures were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized   using a proximally contoured or precontoured locking compression   plate. Mason type I fractures of the radial head were treated conservatively, type   II fractures were treated with reconstruction, and type III fractures   with arthroplasty. All Morrey type II and III fractures of the coronoid   process was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized using lag screws.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Good results were found for the MMWS, with a mean of 88.4 (40 to   100). There were 29 excellent results (63%), nine good (20%), seven   satisfactory (15%), and one poor (2%). Excellent results were obtained   for the MEPS, with a mean of 90.7 (70 to 100): 31 excellent results   (68%), 13 good (28%), and two fair (4%). Good results were also   found for the functional rating index of Broberg and Morrey, with   a mean score of 86.6 (57 to 100). There were 16 excellent results   (35%), 22 good (48%), six fair (13%), and two poor (4%). The mean DASH   score was 15.1 (0 to 55.8). Two patients had delayed wound healing;   four patients had nonunion requiring bone grafting. One patient   had asymptomatic loosening of the radial head prosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Monteggia-like lesions are rare. With correct identification,   classification, and understanding using CT scans followed by appropriate   surgical treatment that addresses all components of the injury,   good to excellent mid-term results can be achieved.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:212–18.</p></sec>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s require extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s to transport resources and information. Biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s must trade-off <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> efficiency with the risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> failure. Yet, biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s with minimal length paths through the maze after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>: ant colonies. We hypothesise that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in dynamic environments.</p>

Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response as well as in supporting the generation of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues play an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response of plants to light stress.</p>

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density versus cells with high t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after mechanical unloading.</p></sec>

The fundamental advantages of temporal networks
<p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s of scientific interest are characterized by temporal links, meaning the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>’s structure changes over time. Link temporality has been shown to hinder many dynamical processes, from information spreading to accessibility, by disrupting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> paths. Considering the ubiquity of temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in nature, we ask: Are there any advantages of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s’ temporality? We use an analytical framework to show that temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s can, compared to their static counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand orders of magnitude less control energy, and have control trajectories, that are considerably more compact than those characterizing static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s. Thus, temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, enhancing our ability to control them.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">librari</span></strong>es has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or in the vocal motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. We suggest that sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Network Modeling Unravels Mechanisms of Crosstalk between Ethylene and Salicylate Signaling in Potato
<p>To develop novel crop breeding strategies, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between plants and their pathogens. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling represents a powerful tool that can unravel properties of complex biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. In this study, we aimed to use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling to better understand immune signaling in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>). For this, we first built on a reliable Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) immune signaling model, extending it with the information from diverse publicly available resources. Next, we translated the resulting prior knowledge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> (20,012 nodes and 70,091 connections) to potato and superimposed it with an ensemble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> inferred from time-resolved transcriptomics data for potato. We used different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling approaches to generate specific hypotheses of potato immune signaling mechanisms. An interesting finding was the identification of a string of molecular events illuminating the ethylene pathway modulation of the salicylic acid pathway through Nonexpressor of PR Genes1 gene expression. Functional validations confirmed this modulation, thus supporting the potential of our integrative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling approach for unraveling molecular mechanisms in complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. In addition, this approach can ultimately result in improved breeding strategies for potato and other sensitive crops.</p>

Systematic discovery of antiphage defense systems in the microbial pangenome
<p>The arms race between bacteria and phages led to the development of sophisticated antiphage defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, including CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Evidence suggests that known and unknown defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s are located in “defense islands” in microbial genomes. Here, we comprehensively characterized the bacterial defensive arsenal by examining gene families that are clustered next to known defense genes in prokaryotic genomes. Candidate defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>atically engineered and validated in model bacteria for their antiphage activities. We report nine previously unknown antiphage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s and one antiplasmid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> that are widespread in microbes and strongly protect against foreign invaders. These include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s that adopted components of the bacterial flagella and condensin complexes. Our data also suggest a common, ancient ancestry of innate immunity components shared between animals, plants, and bacteria.</p>

Consensus Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Key Regulators of Flower and Fruit Development in Wild Strawberry
<p>The diploid strawberry, <i>Fragaria vesca</i>, is a developing model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> for the economically important Rosaceae family. Strawberry fleshy fruit develops from the floral receptacle and its ripening is nonclimacteric. The external seed configuration of strawberry fruit facilitates the study of seed-to-fruit cross tissue communication, particularly phytohormone biosynthesis and transport. To investigate strawberry fruit development, we previously generated spatial and temporal transcriptome data profiling <i>F. vesca</i> flower and fruit development pre- and postfertilization. In this study, we combined 46 of our existing RNA-seq <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">librari</span></strong>es to generate coexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s using the Weighted Gene Co-Expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> Analysis package in R. We then applied a post-hoc consensus clustering approach and used bootstrapping to demonstrate consensus clustering’s ability to produce robust and reproducible clusters. Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, including increased iron transport from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene. To increase their utility, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s are presented in a web interface (<ext-link>www.fv.rosaceaefruits.org</ext-link>) for easy exploration and identification of coexpressed genes. Together, the work reported here illustrates ways to generate robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s optimized for the mining of large transcriptome data sets, thereby providing a useful resource for hypothesis generation and experimental design in strawberry and related Rosaceae fruit crops.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> performance, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">librari</span></strong>es from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s together resulted in improved performance compared to single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, predominantly the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants
<p>Non-cell autonomous RNA silencing can spread from cell to cell and over long distances in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile gene silencing are poorly understood. Here, we identified a <i>DICER-LIKE2</i> (<i>DCL2</i>)<i>-</i>dependent mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic spread of posttranscriptional RNA silencing, also known as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Using a suite of transgenic <i>DCL</i> RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that <i>N. benthamiana</i> DCL1, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22, 24, and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of <i>DCL2</i> expression reduced the spread of gene silencing, while suppression of <i>DCL3</i> or <i>DCL4</i> expression enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. In contrast to <i>DCL4</i> RNAi lines, <i>DCL2</i>-<i>DCL4</i> double-RNAi lines developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS similar to that observed in <i>DCL2</i> RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that <i>DCL2</i> was required in the scion to respond to the signal, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated <i>DCL</i> genetic pathway in which <i>DCL2</i> plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, while both <i>DCL4</i> and <i>DCL3</i> attenuate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. We discuss the potential role of 21, 22, and 24 nt siRNAs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, reconstructing such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee reconstruction accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to construct a phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in reconstructing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

Observation of parity-time symmetry breaking in a single-spin system
<p>Steering the evolution of single spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s is crucial for quantum computing and quantum sensing. The dynamics of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s has been theoretically investigated with parity-time–symmetric Hamiltonians exhibiting exotic properties. Although parity-time symmetry has been explored in classical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, its observation in a single quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remains elusive. We developed a method to dilate a general parity-time–symmetric Hamiltonian into a Hermitian one. The quantum state evolutions ranging from regions of unbroken to broken [Formula] symmetry have been observed with a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Owing to the universality of the dilation method, our result provides a route for further exploiting and understanding the exotic properties of parity-time symmetric Hamiltonian in quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.</p>

<p>Increasing rates of human-caused species invasions and extinctions may reshape communities and modify the structure, dynamics, and stability of species interactions. To investigate how such changes affect communities, we performed multiscale analyses of seed dispersal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s on Oahu, Hawaii. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s consisted exclusively of novel interactions, were largely dominated by introduced species, and exhibited specialized and modular structure at local and regional scales, despite high interaction dissimilarity across communities. Furthermore, the structure and stability of the novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s were similar to native-dominated communities worldwide. Our findings suggest that shared evolutionary history is not a necessary process for the emergence of complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> structure, and interaction patterns may be highly conserved, regardless of species identity and environment. Introduced species can quickly become well integrated into novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, making restoration of native eco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s more challenging than previously thought.</p>

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s carrying out complex computations were biological nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to brain circuits as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent computation by brain-like circuits (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical circuitry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>” (or deep net) architecture, this brain-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central areas of AI research, including computer vision, speech recognition and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as computer vision and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of brain circuitry could supply cues for guiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

Emergence of coexisting ordered states in active matter systems
<p>Active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can produce a far greater variety of ordered patterns than conventional equilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. In particular, transitions between disorder and either polar- or nematically ordered phases have been predicted and observed in two-dimensional active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, coexistence between phases of different types of order has not been reported. We demonstrate the emergence of dynamic coexistence of ordered states with fluctuating nematic and polar symmetry in an actomyosin motility assay. Combining experiments with agent-based simulations, we identify sufficiently weak interactions that lack a clear alignment symmetry as a prerequisite for coexistence. Thus, the symmetry of macroscopic order becomes an emergent and dynamic property of the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. These results provide a pathway by which living <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can express different types of order by using identical building blocks.</p>

Connecting neuronal circuits for movement
<p>Movement is the most common final output of nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> activity and is essential for survival. But what makes this seemingly trivial statement so scientifically challenging? Neurons that contribute to when and how our body moves are distributed throughout the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Thus, even a simple movement such as arm flexion requires the coordinated activation of many different neuronal populations across multiple brain regions. A key question is how the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> produces diverse and precise actions aligned with the organisms' behavioral needs. These processes are affected in diseases such as Parkinson's or Huntington's, in which aberrant motor behavior dominates. Recent studies are transformative in how we think about the control of movement. A common denominator of these studies is that brain regions that contribute to motor behavior can no longer be considered as interacting boxes. Instead, deep circuit-level insight based on specific neuronal populations emerges as being critical to revealing motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> organization and understanding its function. It is likely that insights at this level can also help to design more specific and direct interventions for diseases of the motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and neuroprosthetics applied after injuries.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems
<p>Mechanical power limitations emerge from the physical trade-off between force and velocity. Many biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s incorporate power-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small sizes. We establish how power enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own force-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to biological and synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. This analysis defines the cascading challenges of power enhancement, explores their emergent effects in biological and engineered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, and charts a pathway for higher-level analysis and synthesis of power-amplified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.</p>

Recurrences in an isolated quantum many-body system
<p>The complexity of interacting quantum many-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s leads to exceedingly long recurrence times of the initial quantum state for all but the smallest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. For large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, one cannot probe the full quantum state in all its details. Thus, experimentally, recurrences can only be determined on the level of the accessible observables. Realizing a commensurate spectrum of collective excitations in one-dimensional superfluids, we demonstrate recurrences of coherence and long-range order in an interacting quantum many-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> containing thousands of particles. Our findings will enable the study of the coherent dynamics of large quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s even after they have reached a transient thermal-like state.</p>

RNA editing with CRISPR-Cas13
<p>Nucleic acid editing holds promise for treating genetic disease, particularly at the RNA level, where disease-relevant sequences can be rescued to yield functional protein products. Type VI CRISPR-Cas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s contain the programmable single-effector RNA-guided ribonuclease Cas13. We profiled type VI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in order to engineer a Cas13 ortholog capable of robust knockdown and demonstrated RNA editing by using catalytically inactive Cas13 (dCas13) to direct adenosine-to-inosine deaminase activity by ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 2) to transcripts in mammalian cells. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, referred to as RNA Editing for Programmable A to I Replacement (REPAIR), which has no strict sequence constraints, can be used to edit full-length transcripts containing pathogenic mutations. We further engineered this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to create a high-specificity variant and minimized the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to facilitate viral delivery. REPAIR presents a promising RNA-editing platform with broad applicability for research, therapeutics, and biotechnology.</p>

Small vulnerable sets determine large network cascades in power grids
<p>The understanding of cascading failures in complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s has been hindered by the lack of realistic large-scale modeling and analysis that can account for variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> conditions. Using the North American power grid, we identified, quantified, and analyzed the set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> components that are vulnerable to cascading failures under any out of multiple conditions. We show that the vulnerable set consists of a small but topologically central portion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> and that large cascades are disproportionately more likely to be triggered by initial failures close to this set. These results elucidate aspects of the origins and causes of cascading failures relevant for grid design and operation and demonstrate vulnerability analysis methods that are applicable to a wider class of cascade-prone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

K<sup>+</sup> Efflux Antiporters 4, 5, and 6 Mediate pH and K<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis in Endomembrane Compartments
<p>KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) K<sup>+</sup> efflux antiporter (KEA) family that share high sequence similarity but whose function remains unknown. Here, we show their gene expression pattern, subcellular localization, and physiological function in Arabidopsis. <i>KEA4</i>, <i>KEA5</i>, and <i>KEA6</i> had similar tissue expression patterns, and the three KEA proteins localized to the Golgi, the trans-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, and the prevacuolar compartment/multivesicular bodies, suggesting overlapping roles of these proteins in the endomembrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Phenotypic analyses of single, double, and triple mutants confirmed functional redundancy. The triple mutant <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> had small rosettes, short seedlings, and was sensitive to low K<sup>+</sup> availability and to the sodicity imposed by high salinity. Also, the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant plants had a reduced luminal pH in the Golgi, trans-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, prevacuolar compartment, and vacuole, in accordance with the K/H exchange activity of KEA proteins. Genetic analysis indicated that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 as well as endosomal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>exchanger5 (NHX5) and NHX6 acted coordinately to facilitate endosomal pH homeostasis and salt tolerance. Neither cancelling nor overexpressing the vacuolar antiporters <i>NHX1</i> and <i>NHX2</i> in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background altered the salt-sensitive phenotype. The NHX1 and NHX2 proteins in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background could not suppress the acidity of the endomembrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> but brought the vacuolar pH close to wild-type values. Together, these data signify that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are endosomal K<sup>+</sup> transporters functioning in maintaining pH and ion homeostasis in the endomembrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>.</p>

A Genetic Screen for Impaired Systemic RNAi Highlights the Crucial Role of DICER-LIKE 2
<p>Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of transgenes involves abundant 21-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and low-abundance 22-nucleotide siRNAs produced from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by DCL4 and DCL2, respectively. However, DCL2 facilitates the recruitment of RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) to ARGONAUTE 1-derived cleavage products, resulting in more efficient amplification of secondary and transitive dsRNA and siRNAs. Here, we describe a reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> where RDR6-dependent PTGS is initiated by restricted expression of an inverted-repeat dsRNA specifically in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root tip, allowing a genetic screen to identify mutants impaired in RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Our screen identified <i>dcl2</i> but not <i>dcl4</i> mutants. Moreover, grafting experiments showed that DCL2, but not DCL4, is required in both the source rootstock and the recipient shoot tissue for efficient RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Furthermore, <i>dcl4</i> rootstocks produced more DCL2-dependent 22-nucleotide siRNAs than the wild type and showed enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic movement of PTGS to grafted shoots. Thus, along with its role in recruiting RDR6 for further amplification of PTGS, DCL2 is crucial for RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

ChloroKB: A Web Application for the Integration of Knowledge Related to Chloroplast Metabolic Network
<p>Higher plants, as autotrophic organisms, are effective sources of molecules. They hold great promise for metabolic engineering, but the behavior of plant metabolism at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> level is still incompletely described. Although structural models (stoichiometry matrices) and pathway databases are extremely useful, they cannot describe the complexity of the metabolic context, and new tools are required to visually represent integrated biocurated knowledge for use by both humans and computers. Here, we describe ChloroKB, a Web application (<ext-link>http://chlorokb.fr/</ext-link>) for visual exploration and analysis of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> in the chloroplast and related cellular pathways. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> was manually reconstructed through extensive biocuration to provide transparent traceability of experimental data. Proteins and metabolites were placed in their biological context (spatial distribution within cells, connectivity in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, participation in supramolecular complexes, and regulatory interactions) using CellDesigner software. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> contains 1,147 reviewed proteins (559 localized exclusively in plastids, 68 in at least one additional compartment, and 520 outside the plastid), 122 proteins awaiting biochemical/genetic characterization, and 228 proteins for which genes have not yet been identified. The visual presentation is intuitive and browsing is fluid, providing instant access to the graphical representation of integrated processes and to a wealth of refined qualitative and quantitative data. ChloroKB will be a significant support for structural and quantitative kinetic modeling, for biological reasoning, when comparing novel data with established knowledge, for computer analyses, and for educational purposes. ChloroKB will be enhanced by continuous updates following contributions from plant researchers.</p>

A Viral Satellite DNA Vector (TYLCCNV) for Functional Analysis of miRNAs and siRNAs in Plants
<p>With experimental and bioinformatical methods, numerous small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), have been found in plants, and they play vital roles in various biological regulation processes. However, most of these small RNAs remain to be functionally characterized. Until now, only several viral vectors were developed to overexpress miRNAs with limited application in plants. In this study, we report a new small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> via viral satellite DNA associated with <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</i> (TYLCCNV) vector, which could highly overexpress not only artificial and endogenous miRNAs but also endogenous siRNAs in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. First, we constructed basic TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(319L) vector with widely used <i>AtMIR319a</i> backbone, but the expected photobleaching phenotype was very weak. Second, through comparing the effect of backbones (<i>AtMIR319a</i>, <i>AtMIR390a</i>, and <i>SlMIR159</i>) on specificity and significance of generating small RNAs, the <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone was optimally selected to construct the small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Third, through sRNA-Seq and Degradome-Seq, the small RNAs from <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone in TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(390) vector were confirmed to highly overexpress amiRPDS and specifically silence targeted <i>PDS</i> gene. Using this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, rapid functional analysis of endogenous miRNAs and siRNAs was carried out, including miR156 and <i>athTAS3a</i> 5′D8(+). Meanwhile, through designing corresponding artificial miRNAs, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> could also significantly silence targeted endogenous genes and show specific phenotypes, including <i>PDS</i>, <i>Su</i>, and <i>PCNA</i>. These results demonstrated that this small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> could contribute to investigating not only the function of endogenous small RNAs, but also the functional genes in plants.</p>

Ultrafast optical ranging using microresonator soliton frequency combs
<p>Light detection and ranging is widely used in science and industry.

Here we used cryo-focused ion beam milling, electron cryotomography, and functional assays to study a T6SS in <i>Amoebophilus asiaticus</i>.

Lateral baseplate interactions coordinated T6SSs in hexagonal arrays. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> mediated interactions with host membranes and may participate in phagosome escape. Evolutionary sequence analyses predicted that T6SSs are more widespread than previously thought. Our insights form the basis for understanding T6SS key concepts and exploring T6SS diversity.</p>

Two areas for familiar face recognition in the primate brain
<p>Familiarity alters face recognition: Familiar faces are recognized more accurately than unfamiliar ones and under difficult viewing conditions when unfamiliar face recognition fails. The neural basis for this fundamental difference remains unknown. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that personally familiar faces engage the macaque face-processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> more than unfamiliar faces. Familiar faces also recruited two hitherto unknown face areas at anatomically conserved locations within the perirhinal cortex and the temporal pole. These two areas, but not the core face-processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, responded to familiar faces emerging from a blur with a characteristic nonlinear surge, akin to the abruptness of familiar face recognition. In contrast, responses to unfamiliar faces and objects remained linear. Thus, two temporal lobe areas extend the core face-processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> into a familiar face-recognition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>.</p>

Chemogenetics revealed: DREADD occupancy and activation via converted clozapine
<p>The chemogenetic technology DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) is widely used for remote manipulation of neuronal activity in freely moving animals. DREADD technology posits the use of “designer receptors,” which are exclusively activated by the “designer drug” clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Nevertheless, the in vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed. CNO does not enter the brain after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic drug injections and shows low affinity for DREADDs. Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency. Upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic CNO injections, converted clozapine readily enters the brain and occupies central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>–expressed DREADDs, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic subthreshold clozapine injections induce preferential DREADD-mediated behaviors.</p>

Hydraulic control of tuna fins: A role for the lymphatic system in vertebrate locomotion
<p>The lymphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in teleost fish has genetic and developmental origins similar to those of the mammalian lymphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, which is involved in immune response and fluid homeostasis. Here, we show that the lymphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> of tunas functions in swimming hydrodynamics. Specifically, a musculo-vascular complex, consisting of fin muscles, bones, and lymphatic vessels, is involved in the hydraulic control of median fins. This specialization of the lymphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is associated with fish in the family Scombridae and may have evolved in response to the demand for swimming and maneuvering control in these high-performance species.</p>

Entanglement distillation between solid-state quantum network nodes
<p>The impact of future quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s hinges on high-quality quantum entanglement shared between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> nodes. Unavoidable imperfections necessitate a means to improve remote entanglement by local quantum operations. We realize entanglement distillation on a quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> primitive of distant electron-nuclear two-qubit nodes. The heralded generation of two copies of a remote entangled state is demonstrated through single-photon–mediated entangling of the electrons and robust storage in the nuclear spins. After applying local two-qubit gates, single-shot measurements herald the distillation of an entangled state with increased fidelity that is available for further use. The key combination of generating, storing, and processing entangled states should enable the exploration of multiparticle entanglement on an extended quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>.</p>

Ring attractor dynamics in the <i>Drosophila</i> central brain
<p>Ring attractors are a class of recurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s hypothesized to underlie the representation of heading direction. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> structures, schematized as a ring of neurons whose connectivity depends on their heading preferences, can sustain a bump-like activity pattern whose location can be updated by continuous shifts along either turn direction. We recently reported that a population of fly neurons represents the animal’s heading via bump-like activity dynamics. We combined two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed flying flies with optogenetics to overwrite the existing population representation with an artificial one, which was then maintained by the circuit with naturalistic dynamics. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> with local excitation and global inhibition enforces this unique and persistent heading representation. Ring attractor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s have long been invoked in theoretical work; our study provides physiological evidence of their existence and functional architecture.</p>

Lineage-dependent spatial and functional organization of the mammalian enteric nervous system
<p>The enteric nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (ENS) is essential for digestive function and gut homeostasis. Here we show that the amorphous neuroglia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s of the mouse ENS are composed of overlapping clonal units founded by postmigratory neural crest–derived progenitors. The spatial configuration of ENS clones depends on proliferation-driven local interactions of ENS progenitors with lineally unrelated neuroectodermal cells, the ordered colonization of the serosa-mucosa axis by clonal descendants, and gut expansion. Single-cell transcriptomics and mutagenesis analysis delineated dynamic molecular states of ENS progenitors and identified RET as a regulator of neurogenic commitment. Clonally related enteric neurons exhibit synchronous activity in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> stimulation. Thus, lineage relationships underpin the organization of the peripheral nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>.</p>

An Efficient System for <i>Ds</i> Transposon Tagging in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Transposon tagging is a powerful tool that has been widely applied in several species for insertional mutagenesis in plants. Several efforts have aimed to create transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutant populations in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot plant used as a model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to study temperate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at using transposon strategies. Here, we describe the application of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociation</i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> element were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> plants. The <i>Ds</i> element was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the function of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, and segregation, the <i>Ds</i> element separated from the <i>Ac</i> element. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only plants using G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> lines, some of which were highly efficient at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only plants. Furthermore, we identified a large collection of mutants with visible developmental phenotypes via this transposon tagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is relatively simple and rapid in comparison to traditional T-DNA insertion strategies, because once efficiency lines are obtained they can be reused to generate more lines from nontransposed plants without the use of time-consuming tissue culture steps.</p>

The Ring-Type E3 Ubiquitin Ligase JUL1 Targets the VQ-Motif Protein JAV1 to Coordinate Jasmonate Signaling
<p>Jasmonates regulate plant defense and development. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED VQ-MOTIF GENE1 (JAV1/VQ22) is a repressor of jasmonate-mediated defense responses and is degraded through the ubiquitin<i>-</i>26S proteasome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> after herbivory. We found that JAV1-ASSOCIATED UBIQUITIN LIGASE1 (JUL1), a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacted with JAV1. JUL1 interacted with JAV1 in the nucleus to ubiquitinate JAV1, leading to proteasomal degradation of JAV1. The transcript levels of <i>JUL1</i> and <i>JAV1</i> were coordinately and positively regulated by the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1-dependent signaling pathway in the jasmonate signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, but in a manner that was not dependent on CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1-mediated signaling upon herbivory by <i>Spodoptera litura</i>. Gain or loss of function of JUL1 modulated the expression levels of the defensin gene <i>PDF1.2</i> in leaves, conferring on the plants various defense properties against the generalist herbivore <i>S. litura</i>. Because neither the <i>JUL1</i> mutant nor overexpression lines showed any obvious developmental defects, we concluded that the JAV1/JUL1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> functions as a specific coordinator of reprogramming of plant defense responses. Altogether, our findings offer insight into the mechanisms by which the JAV1/JUL1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> acts specifically to coordinate plant defense responses without interfering with plant development or growth.</p>

Split-TALE: A TALE-Based Two-Component System for Synthetic Biology Applications in Planta
<p>Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are bacterial Type-III effector proteins from phytopathogenic <i>Xanthomonas</i> species that act as transcription factors in plants. The modular DNA-binding domain of TALEs can be reprogrammed to target nearly any DNA sequence. Here, we designed and optimized a two-component AND-gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> for synthetic circuits in plants based on TALEs. In this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, named split-TALE (sTALE), the TALE DNA binding domain and the transcription activation domain are separated and each fused to protein interacting domains. Physical interaction of interacting domains leads to TALE-reconstitution and can be monitored by reporter gene induction. This setup was used for optimization of the sTALE scaffolds, which result in an AND-gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. We also provide a toolkit of ready-to-use vectors and single modules compatible with Golden Gate cloning and MoClo syntax. In addition to its implementation in synthetic regulatory circuits, the sTALE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> allows the analysis of protein-protein interactions in planta.</p>

Selective Targeting of Mobile mRNAs to Plasmodesmata for Cell-to-Cell Movement
<p>Many plant mRNAs move from cell to cell or long distance to execute non-cell-autonomous functions. These mobile mRNAs traffic through the phloem to regulate many developmental processes, but despite the burgeoning discovery of mobile mRNAs, little is known about the mechanism underlying the intracellular sorting of these mRNAs. Here, we exploited a fluorescence-based mRNA labeling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, using the bacteriophage coat protein MS2, fused to GFP (MS2-GFP) and an MS2 recognition site in the RNA of interest, to visualize the intracellular trafficking of mobile mRNAs in living plant cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We first improved this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> by using the nuclear localization sequence from FD, which substantially reduced the fluorescent background of MS2-GFP in the cytoplasm. The modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> allowed us to observe the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci dependent on MS2-binding sites. Coexpressing the MS2-GFP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with a virus movement protein, which is a plasmodesmata (PD)-localized nonspecific RNA-binding protein, targeted cytoplasmic fluorescent foci to the PD, suggesting that the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci contain mRNA and MS2-GFP. Our ex vivo RNA imaging revealed that mobile but not nonmobile mRNAs were selectively targeted to PD. Real-time images of intracellular translocation revealed that the translocation of mRNA and organelles in the transvacuolar strands may be governed by the same mechanism. Our study suggests that PD targeting of mRNA is a selective step in determining mRNA cell-to-cell movement of mRNAs.</p>

Mycorrhiza-Triggered Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Networks Impinge on Herbivore Fitness
<p>Symbioses between plants and mycorrhizal fungi are ubiquitous in eco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s and strengthen the plants’ defense against aboveground herbivores. Here, we studied the underlying regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s and biochemical mechanisms in leaves induced by ectomycorrhizae that modify herbivore interactions. Feeding damage and oviposition by the widespread poplar leaf beetle <i>Chrysomela populi</i> were reduced on the ectomycorrhizal hybrid poplar <i>Populus</i> × <i>canescens</i>. Integration of transcriptomics, metabolomics, and volatile emission patterns via mass difference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s demonstrated changes in nitrogen allocation in the leaves of mycorrhizal poplars, down-regulation of phenolic pathways, and up-regulation of defensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, including protease inhibitors, chitinases, and aldoxime biosynthesis. Ectomycorrhizae had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic influence on jasmonate-related signaling transcripts. Our results suggest that ectomycorrhizae prime wounding responses and shift resources from constitutive phenol-based to specialized protective compounds. Consequently, symbiosis with ectomycorrhizal fungi enabled poplars to respond to leaf beetle feeding with a more effective arsenal of defense mechanisms compared with nonmycorrhizal poplars, thus demonstrating the importance of belowground plant-microbe associations in mitigating aboveground biotic stress.</p>

A New Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus Allows Large Protein Overexpression for Rapid Function Analysis
<p>Understanding the genetic and molecular bases of gene function is of increasing importance to harness their potential to produce plants with novel traits. One important objective is the improvement of plant productivity to meet future demands in food crop production. Gene function is mostly characterized through overexpression or silencing in transgenic plants. This approach is a lengthy procedure, especially in cereals. Plant viral expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can be used for rapid expression of proteins. However, current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s have a small cargo capacity and have mostly been used for gene silencing. Here, a four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with high cargo capacity was constructed for the rapid and stable expression of recombinant proteins in different plant species, allowing function analyses at different stages of development. Fluorescent marker proteins are expressed at high levels within 1 week, and a proof of efficient function analysis is shown using the aluminum malate transporter1 gene. In addition to the ability of gene cotransformation, this work demonstrates that the four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> allows the overexpression of cDNAs of up to 2,100 nucleotides (encoding a protein of ∼78 kD), thereby providing an invaluable tool to accelerate functional genomics and proteomic research in monocot and dicot species.</p>

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis in plants enables the development of high-throughput mutagenesis strategies. By transforming pooled CRISPR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">librari</span></strong>es into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were generated with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 targeted genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying targeted genes. Plants with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a collection of lines with targeted mutations and should be applicable to any plant transformation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>.</p>

Biochemical Principles and Functional Aspects of Pipecolic Acid Biosynthesis in Plant Immunity
<p>The nonprotein amino acid pipecolic acid (Pip) regulates plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired resistance and basal immunity to bacterial pathogen infection. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the lysine (Lys) aminotransferase AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1 (ALD1) mediates the pathogen-induced accumulation of Pip in inoculated and distal leaf tissue. Here, we show that ALD1 transfers the α-amino group of <sc>l</sc>-Lys to acceptor oxoacids. Combined mass spectrometric and infrared spectroscopic analyses of in vitro assays and plant extracts indicate that the final product of the ALD1-catalyzed reaction is enaminic 2,3-dehydropipecolic acid (DP), whose formation involves consecutive transamination, cyclization, and isomerization steps. Besides <sc>l</sc>-Lys, recombinant ALD1 transaminates <sc>l</sc>-methionine, <sc>l</sc>-leucine, diaminopimelate, and several other amino acids to generate oxoacids or derived products in vitro. However, detailed in planta analyses suggest that the biosynthesis of 2,3-DP from <sc>l</sc>-Lys is the major in vivo function of ALD1. Since <i>ald1</i> mutant plants are able to convert exogenous 2,3-DP into Pip, their Pip deficiency relies on the inability to form the 2,3-DP intermediate. The Arabidopsis reductase ornithine cyclodeaminase/μ-crystallin, alias <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>IC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE-DEFICIENT4 (SARD4), converts ALD1-generated 2,3-DP into Pip in vitro. SARD4 significantly contributes to the production of Pip in pathogen-inoculated leaves but is not the exclusive reducing enzyme involved in Pip biosynthesis. Functional <i>SARD4</i> is required for proper basal immunity to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Although <i>SARD4</i> knockout plants show greatly reduced accumulation of Pip in leaves distal to <i>P. syringae</i> inoculation, they display a considerable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired resistance response. This suggests a triggering function of locally accumulating Pip for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic resistance induction.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology

Small molecules are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">librari</span></strong>es. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in screens designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

The olfactory neuron AWC promotes avoidance of normally palatable food following chronic dietary restriction
<p>Changes in metabolic state alter foraging behavior and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference in animals. Here, I show that normally attractive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> becomes repulsive to <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> if animals are chronically undernourished as a result of alimentary tract defects. This behavioral plasticity is achieved in two ways: increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> leaving and induction of aversive behavior towards <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>. A particularly strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoider is defective in the chitin synthase that makes the pharyngeal lining. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance induced by underfeeding is mediated by cGMP signaling in the olfactory neurons AWC and AWB, and the gustatory neurons ASJ and ASK. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance is enhanced by increased population density and is reduced if the animals are unable to correctly interpret their nutritional state as a result of defects in the AMP kinase or TOR/S6kinase pathways. The TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway suppresses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance and the cellular basis for this is distinct from its role in aversive olfactory learning of harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>. This study suggests that nutritional state feedback via nutrient sensors, population size and olfactory neurons guides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

Sources of Sodium in US Adults From 3 Geographic Regions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US adults consume excess sodium. Knowledge about the dietary sources of sodium intake is critical to the development of effective reduction strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 450 adults were recruited from 3 geographic locations: Birmingham, AL (n=150); Palo Alto, CA (n=150); and the Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN (n=150), metropolitan areas. Equal numbers of women and men from each of 4 race/ethnic groups (blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites) were targeted for recruitment. Four record-assisted 24-hour dietary recalls were collected from each participant with special procedures, which included the collection of duplicate samples of salt added to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> at the table and in home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Sodium added to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> outside the home was the leading source of sodium, accounting for more than two thirds (70.9%) of total sodium intake in the sample.

Processed foods and food reward

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and zygotic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

SDG2-Mediated H3K4me3 Is Crucial for Chromatin Condensation and Mitotic Division during Male Gametogenesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming occurring during reproduction is crucial for both animal and plant development. Histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mark of transcriptional active euchromatin. While much has been learned in somatic cells, H3K4me3 deposition and function in gametophyte is poorly studied. Here, we demonstrate that SET DOMAIN GROUP2 (SDG2)-mediated H3K4me3 deposition participates in epigenetic reprogramming during Arabidopsis male gametogenesis. We show that loss of SDG2 barely affects meiosis and cell fate establishment of haploid cells. However, we found that SDG2 is critical for postmeiotic microspore development. Mitotic cell division progression is partly impaired in the loss-of-function <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant, particularly at the second mitosis setting up the two sperm cells. We demonstrate that SDG2 is involved in promoting chromatin decondensation in the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative nucleus, likely through its role in H3K4me3 deposition, which prevents ectopic heterochromatic H3K9me2 speckle formation. Moreover, we found that derepression of the LTR retrotransposon <i>ATLANTYS1</i> is compromised in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell of the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant pollen. Consistent with chromatin condensation and compromised transcription activity, pollen germination and pollen tube elongation, representing the key function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell in transporting sperm cells during fertilization, are inhibited in the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant. Taken together, we conclude that SDG2-mediated H3K4me3 is an essential epigenetic mark of the gametophyte chromatin landscape, playing critical roles in gamete mitotic cell cycle progression and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell function during male gametogenesis and beyond.</p>

Regulation of Vegetative Phase Change by SWI2/SNF2 Chromatin Remodeling ATPase BRAHMA
<p>Plants progress from a juvenile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase of development to an adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase of development before they enter the reproductive phase. miR156 has been shown to be the master regulator of the juvenile-to-adult transition in plants. However, the mechanism of how miR156 is transcriptionally regulated still remains elusive. In a forward genetic screen, we identified that a mutation in the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) exhibited an accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase change phenotype by reducing the expression of miR156, which in turn caused a corresponding increase in the levels of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> genes. BRM regulates miR156 expression by directly binding to the <i>MIR156A</i> promoter. Mutations in <i>BRM</i> not only increased occupancy of the −2 and +1 nucleosomes proximal to the transcription start site at the <i>MIR156A</i> locus but also the levels of trimethylated histone H3 at Lys 27. The precocious phenotype of <i>brm</i> mutant was partially suppressed by a second mutation in <i>SWINGER</i> (<i>SWN</i>), but not by a mutation in <i>CURLEY LEAF</i>, both of which are key components of the Polycomb Group Repressive Complex 2 in plants. Our results indicate that BRM and SWN act antagonistically at the nucleosome level to fine-tune the temporal expression of miR156 to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase change in Arabidopsis.</p>

The impact of long-term water stress on tree architecture and production is related to changes in transitions between vegetative and reproductive growth in the ‘Granny Smith’ apple cultivar
<p>Water stress (WS) generates a number of physiological and morphological responses in plants that depend on the intensity and duration of stress as well as the plant species and development stage. In perennial plants, WS may affect plant development through cumulative effects that modify plant functions, architecture and production over time. Plant architecture depends on the fate of the terminal and axillary buds that can give rise, in the particular case of apple, to reproductive or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth units (GUs) of different lengths. In this study, the impact of long-term WS (7 years) on the fate of terminal and axillary buds was investigated in relation to flowering occurrence and production pattern (biennial vs regular) in the ‘Granny Smith’ cultivar. It was observed that WS decreased the total number of GUs per branch, regardless of their type. Conversely, WS did not modify the timing of the two successive developmental phases characterized by the production of long and medium GUs and an alternation of floral GUs over time, respectively. The analysis of GU successions over time using a variable-order Markov chain that included both the effects of the predecessor and water treatment revealed that WS reduced the transition towards long and medium GUs and increased the transition toward floral, short and dead GUs. WS also slightly increased the proportion of axillary floral GUs. The higher relative frequency of floral GUs compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative ones reduced the tendency to biennial bearing under WS. The accelerated ontogenetic trend observed under WS suggests lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth that could, in turn, be beneficial to floral induction and fruit set.</p>

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation
<p>Wind and solar farms offer a major pathway to clean, renewable energies. However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended climate consequences. In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation to show that large-scale installations of wind and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold precipitation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface friction and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation further enhances precipitation, creating a positive albedo–precipitation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation feedback that contributes ~80% of the precipitation increase for wind farms. This local enhancement is scale dependent and is particular to the Sahara, with small impacts in other deserts.</p>

Designing river flows to improve food security futures in the Lower Mekong Basin
<p>Rivers provide unrivaled opportunity for clean energy via hydropower, but little is known about the potential impact of dam-building on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> security these rivers provide. In tropical rivers, rainfall drives a periodic flood pulse fueling fish production and delivering nutrition to more than 150 million people worldwide. Hydropower will modulate this flood pulse, thereby threatening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> security. We identified variance components of the Mekong River flood pulse that predict yield in one of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world. We used these variance components to design an algorithm for a managed hydrograph to explore future yields. This algorithm mimics attributes of discharge variance that drive fishery yield: prolonged low flows followed by a short flood pulse. Designed flows increased yield by a factor of 3.7 relative to historical hydrology. Managing desired components of discharge variance will lead to greater efficiency in the Lower Mekong Basin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> system.</p>

Rapid binge-like eating and body weight gain driven by zona incerta GABA neuron activation
<p>The neuronal substrate for binge eating, which can at times lead to obesity, is not clear. We find that optogenetic stimulation of mouse zona incerta (ZI) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons or their axonal projections to paraventricular thalamus (PVT) excitatory neurons immediately (in 2 to 3 seconds) evoked binge-like eating. Minimal intermittent stimulation led to body weight gain; ZI GABA neuron ablation reduced weight. ZI stimulation generated 35% of normal 24-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> intake in just 10 minutes. The ZI cells were excited by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> deprivation and the gut hunger signal ghrelin. In contrast, stimulation of excitatory axons from the parasubthalamic nucleus to PVT or direct stimulation of PVT glutamate neurons reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> intake. These data suggest an unexpected robust orexigenic potential for the ZI GABA neurons.</p>

Branch-specific plasticity of a bifunctional dopamine circuit encodes protein hunger
<p>Free-living animals must not only regulate the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> they consume but also choose which types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> to ingest. The shifting of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference driven by nutrient-specific hunger can be essential for survival, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We identified a dopamine circuit that encodes protein-specific hunger in <i>Drosophila</i>. The activity of these neurons increased after substantial protein deprivation. Activation of this circuit simultaneously promoted protein intake and restricted sugar consumption, via signaling to distinct downstream neurons. Protein starvation triggered branch-specific plastic changes in these dopaminergic neurons, thus enabling sustained protein consumption. These studies reveal a crucial circuit mechanism by which animals adjust their dietary strategy to maintain protein homeostasis.</p>

Extended Vernalization Regulates Inflorescence Fate in <i>Arabis alpina</i> by Stably Silencing <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i>
<p>The alpine perennial <i>Arabis alpina</i> initiates flower buds during prolonged exposure to cold. In the accession Pajares, we demonstrate that the length of vernalization influences flowering time and inflorescence fate but does not affect the axillary branches that maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth. The expression of floral organ identity genes gradually increases in the main shoot apex during vernalization, correlating with an increase in floral commitment. In northern Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions, the length of vernalization modulates the stable silencing of the floral repressor <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>). We demonstrate that expression of <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i> (<i>PEP1</i>), the ortholog of <i>FLC</i> in <i>A. alpina</i>, is similarly influenced by the duration of the exposure to cold. Extended vernalization results in stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence. In contrast, insufficient vernalization leads to <i>PEP1</i> reactivation after cold treatment, which correlates with delayed flowering and the appearance of floral reversion phenotypes such as bracts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative inflorescence branches. Floral reversion phenotypes are reduced in the <i>pep1-1</i> mutant, suggesting that <i>PEP1</i> regulates the fate of the inflorescence after vernalization. The effect of vernalization duration on stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> is specific to meristems that initiate flowering during cold treatment. Extended vernalization fails to silence <i>PEP1</i> in young seedlings and axillary branches that arise from buds initiated during cold treatment, which remain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative. We conclude that the duration of vernalization in <i>A. alpina</i> differentially regulates <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence and axillary branches. <i>PEP1</i> has a dual role regulating meristem fate; it prevents meristems from flowering and antagonizes inflorescence development after vernalization.</p>

Gibberellin Signaling Requires Chromatin Remodeler PICKLE to Promote Vegetative Growth and Phase Transitions
<p>PICKLE (PKL) is an ATP-dependent chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding domain (CHD3) chromatin remodeling enzyme in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Previous studies showed that PKL promotes embryonic-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative transition by inhibiting expression of seed-specific genes during seed germination. The <i>pkl</i> mutants display a low penetrance of the “pickle root” phenotype, with a thick and green primary root that retains embryonic characteristics. The penetrance of this pickle root phenotype in <i>pkl</i> is dramatically increased in gibberellin (GA)-deficient conditions. At adult stages, the <i>pkl</i> mutants are semidwarfs with delayed flowering time, which resemble reduced GA-signaling mutants. These findings suggest that PKL may play a positive role in regulating GA signaling. A recent biochemical analysis further showed that PKL and GA signaling repressors DELLAs antagonistically regulate hypocotyl cell elongation genes by direct protein-protein interaction. To elucidate further the role of PKL in GA signaling and plant development, we studied the genetic interaction between PKL and DELLAs using the hextuple mutant containing <i>pkl</i> and <i>della</i> pentuple (<i>dP</i>) mutations. Here, we show that PKL is required for most of GA-promoted developmental processes, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth such as hypocotyl, leaf, and inflorescence stem elongation, and phase transitions such as juvenile-to-adult leaf and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative-to-reproductive phase. The removal of all DELLA functions (in the <i>dP</i> background) cannot rescue these phenotypes in <i>pkl</i>. RNA-sequencing analysis using the <i>ga1</i> (a GA-deficient mutant), <i>pkl</i>, and the <i>ga1 pkl</i> double mutant further shows that expression of 80% of GA-responsive genes in seedlings is PKL dependent, including genes that function in cell elongation, cell division, and phase transitions. These results indicate that the CHD3 chromatin remodeler PKL is required for regulating gene expression during most of GA-regulated developmental processes.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C allocation to both reproductive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in fruiting and non-fruiting trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of reproduction on C allocation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting trees, fruiting reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting trees than non-fruiting trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of allocation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C allocation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Cascading impacts of large-carnivore extirpation in an African ecosystem
<p>Populations of the world’s largest carnivores are declining and now occupy mere fractions of their historical ranges. Theory predicts that when apex predators disappear, large herbivores become less fearful, occupy new habitats, and modify those habitats by eating new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> plants. Yet experimental support for this prediction has been difficult to obtain in large-mammal systems. After the extirpation of leopards and African wild dogs from Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park, forest-dwelling antelopes [bushbuck (<i>Tragelaphus sylvaticus</i>)] expanded into treeless floodplains, where they consumed novel diets and suppressed a common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> plant [waterwort (<i>Bergia mossambicensis</i>)]. By experimentally simulating predation risk, we demonstrate that this behavior was reversible. Thus, whereas anthropogenic predator extinction disrupted a trophic cascade by enabling rapid differentiation of prey behavior, carnivore restoration may just as rapidly reestablish that cascade.</p>

Hindcasts indicate that the maximum sustainable yield of the evaluated populations decreased by 4.1% from 1930 to 2010, with five ecoregions experiencing losses of 15 to 35%. Outcomes of fisheries management—including long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> provisioning—will be improved by accounting for changing productivity in a warmer ocean.</p>

Peanut allergen–specific antibodies go public
<p>Changes in the human environment and activities over the past few decades have caused an epidemic of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> allergies (<i>1</i>). People suffering from allergies often feel that they live on a cliff edge, as the allergens to which they react are potentially fatal (<i>2</i>). For example, tiny amounts of peanut picked up on skin or contaminating other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>s can be dangerous to peanut-sensitized individuals (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies mediate the allergic response. They bind to specific receptors on inflammatory immune cells: mast cells in mucosal tissues lining body surfaces and cavities, and basophils in the circulation. These cells mediate allergic responses triggered by specific antigens (allergens) that are recognized by IgE. B cells expressing IgG antibodies have long served as the paradigm for the development of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells in the immune response. Until recently, the far less abundant IgE-expressing B cells have proved to be elusive. On page 1306 of this issue, Croote <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) have analyzed single B cells from six individuals with peanut allergy, which enabled the identification of the natural Ig heavy- and light-chain pairs from IgE-expressing B cells that are responsible for peanut allergy. With this information they produced recombinant antibodies, identified the peanut allergen–specific antibodies, and used site-directed mutagenesis to suppress their activity. The mutated antibodies could be used to treat peanut allergy.</p>

Wheat—the cereal abandoned by GM
<p>The sudden appearance of crop diseases can cause an irreparable economic shock, particularly to smallholder farmers in developing countries. Wheat blast, for example, is a devastating fungal disease from South America, which emerged in Bangladesh in 2016 (<i>1</i>). It is currently controlled by quarantine but could easily spread to other wheat-growing areas, which could threaten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> security. Furthermore, widespread crop failure from stem rust has occurred in Kenya and Ethiopia. Recent advances could provide a solution to this problem through the rapid discovery and isolation of disease-resistance genes from wild relatives of wheat, followed by their introduction by transformation into the elite crop varieties. There is, however, a barrier to such progress: Wheat, a worldwide staple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>, has become an orphan among genetically modified (GM) crops.</p>

Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers
<p>Food’s environmental impacts are created by millions of diverse producers. To identify solutions that are effective under this heterogeneity, we consolidated data covering five environmental indicators; 38,700 farms; and 1600 processors, packaging types, and retailers. Impact can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low impacts, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce impacts. Most strikingly, impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>able substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change. Cumulatively, our findings support an approach where producers monitor their own impacts, flexibly meet environmental targets by choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their impacts to consumers.</p>

Evolution of alluvial mudrock forced by early land plants
<p>Mudrocks are a primary archive of Earth’s history from the Archean eon to recent times, and their source-to-sink production and deposition play a central role in long-term ocean chemistry and climate regulation. Using original and published stratigraphic data from all 704 of Earth’s known alluvial formations from the Archean eon (3.5 billion years ago) to the Carboniferous period (0.3 billion years ago), we prove contentions of an upsurge in the proportion of mud retained on land coeval with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation evolution. We constrain the onset of the upsurge to the Ordovician-Silurian and show that alluvium deposited after land plant evolution contains a proportion of mudrock that is, on average, 1.4 orders of magnitude greater than the proportion contained in alluvium from the preceding 90% of Earth’s history. We attribute this shift to the ways in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation revolutionized mud production and sediment flux from continental interiors.</p>

Satellites reveal contrasting responses of regional climate to the widespread greening of Earth
<p>Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation cover associated with the observed greening may affect several biophysical processes, whose net effects on climate are unclear. We analyzed remotely sensed dynamics in leaf area index (LAI) and energy fluxes in order to explore the associated variation in local climate. We show that the increasing trend in LAI contributed to the warming of boreal zones through a reduction of surface albedo and to an evaporation-driven cooling in arid regions. The interplay between LAI and surface biophysics is amplified up to five times under extreme warm-dry and cold-wet years. Altogether, these signals reveal that the recent dynamics in global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation have had relevant biophysical impacts on the local climates and should be considered in the design of local mitigation and adaptation plans.</p>

Soft X-Ray Imaging of Cellular Carbon and Nitrogen Distributions in Heterocystous Cyanobacteria
<p>Soft x-ray microscopy (SXM) is a minimally invasive technique for single-cell high-resolution imaging as well as the visualization of intracellular distributions of light elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We used SXM to observe photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in the filamentous cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120, which can form heterocysts during nitrogen starvation. Statistical and spectroscopic analyses from SXM images around the K-absorption edge of nitrogen revealed a significant difference in the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells and heterocysts. Application of this analysis to soft x-ray images of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 revealed inhomogenous C/N ratios in the cells. Furthermore, soft x-ray tomography of <i>Anabaena</i> sp.

An Animal-Like Cryptochrome Controls the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Sexual Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are known as flavin-binding blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects. The animal-like cryptochrome (aCRY) of the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> has extended our view on cryptochromes, because it responds also to other wavelengths of the visible spectrum, including red light. Here, we have investigated if aCRY is involved in the regulation of the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, which is controlled by blue and red light at the steps of gametogenesis along with its restoration and germination. We show that aCRY is differentially expressed not only during the life cycle but also within the cell as part of the soluble and/or membrane-associated protein fraction. Moreover, localization of aCRY within the algal cell body varies between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells and the different cell types of gametogenesis. aCRY is significantly (early day) or to a small extent (late night) enriched in the nucleus in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells. In pregametes, gametes and dark-inactivated gametes, aCRY is localized over the cell body. aCRY plays an important role in the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>: It controls the germination of the alga, under which the zygote undergoes meiosis, in a positive manner, similar to the regulation by the blue light receptors phototropin and plant cryptochrome (pCRY). However, aCRY acts in combination with pCRY as a negative regulator for mating ability as well as for mating maintenance, opposite to the function of phototropin in these processes.</p>

A 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase Mediates the Biosynthesis of Glucoraphasatin in Radish
<p>Glucosinolates (GSLs) are secondary metabolites whose degradation products confer intrinsic flavors and aromas to Brassicaceae <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ables. Several structures of GSLs are known in the Brassicaceae, and the biosynthetic pathway and regulatory networks have been elucidated in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). GSLs are precursors of chemical defense substances against herbivorous pests. Specific GSLs can act as feeding blockers or stimulants, depending on the pest species. Natural selection has led to diversity in the GSL composition even within individual species. However, in radish (<i>Raphanus sativus</i>), glucoraphasatin (4-methylthio-3-butenyl glucosinolate) accounts for more than 90% of the total GSLs, and little compositional variation is observed. Because glucoraphasatin is not contained in other members of the Brassicaceae, like Arabidopsis and cabbage (<i>Brassica oleracea</i>), the biosynthetic pathways for glucoraphasatin remain unclear. In this report, we identified and characterized a gene encoding GLUCORAPHASATIN SYNTHASE 1 (GRS1) by genetic mapping using a mutant that genetically lacks glucoraphasatin. Transgenic Arabidopsis, which overexpressed <i>GRS1</i> cDNA, accumulated glucoraphasatin in the leaves. <i>GRS1</i> encodes a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, and it is abundantly expressed in the leaf. To further investigate the biosynthesis and transportation of GSLs in radish, we grafted a <i>grs1</i> plant onto a wild-type plant. The grafting experiment revealed a leaf-to-root long-distance glucoraphasatin transport system in radish and showed that the composition of GSLs differed among the organs. Based on these observations, we propose a characteristic biosynthesis pathway for glucoraphasatin in radish. Our results should be useful in metabolite engineering for breeding of high-value <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ables.</p>

The Formation and Sequestration of Nonendogenous Ketocarotenoids in Transgenic <i>Nicotiana glauca</i>
<p>Ketolated and hydroxylated carotenoids are high-value compounds with industrial, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>, and feed applications. Chemical synthesis is currently the production method of choice for these compounds, with no amenable plant sources readily available. In this study, the 4,4′ β-oxygenase (<i>crtW</i>) and 3,3′ β-hydroxylase (c<i>rtZ</i>) genes from <i>Brevundimonas</i> sp. SD-212 were expressed under constitutive transcriptional control in <i>Nicotiana glauca</i>, which has an emerging potential as a biofuel and biorefining feedstock. The transgenic lines produced significant levels of nonendogenous carotenoids in all tissues. In leaf and flower, the carotenoids (∼0.5% dry weight) included 0.3% and 0.48%, respectively, of nonendogenous ketolated and hydroxylated carotenoids. These were 4-ketolutein, echinenone (and its 3-hydroxy derivatives), canthaxanthin, phoenicoxanthin, 4-ketozeaxanthin, and astaxanthin. Stable, homozygous genotypes expressing both transgenes inherited the chemotype. Subcellular fractionation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues and microscopic analysis revealed the presence of ketocarotenoids in thylakoid membranes, not predominantly in the photosynthetic complexes but in plastoglobules. Despite ketocarotenoid production and changes in cellular ultrastructure, intermediary metabolite levels were not dramatically affected. The study illustrates the utility of <i>Brevundimonas</i> sp. SD-212 CRTZ and CRTW to produce ketocarotenoids in a plant species that is being evaluated as a biorefining feedstock, the adaptation of the plastid to sequester nonendogenous carotenoids, and the robustness of plant metabolism to these changes.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an inbred line of <i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>, an allotetraploid crop with great environmental adaptability and outstanding nutritional properties
<p><i>Chenopodium quinoa</i> Willd. (quinoa) originated from the Andean region of South America, and is a pseudocereal crop of the Amaranthaceae family. Quinoa is emerging as an important crop with the potential to contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> security worldwide and is considered to be an optimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> source for astronauts, due to its outstanding nutritional profile and ability to tolerate stressful environments. Furthermore, plant pathologists use quinoa as a representative diagnostic host to identify virus species. However, molecular analysis of quinoa is limited by its genetic heterogeneity due to outcrossing and its genome complexity derived from allotetraploidy. To overcome these obstacles, we established the inbred and standard quinoa accession Kd that enables rigorous molecular analysis, and presented the draft genome sequence of Kd, using an optimized combination of high-throughput next generation sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 and PacBio RS II sequencers. The <i>de novo</i> genome assembly contained 25 k scaffolds consisting of 1 Gbp with N50 length of 86 kbp. Based on these data, we constructed the free-access Quinoa Genome DataBase (QGDB). Thus, these findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying agronomically important traits of quinoa and the effect of allotetraploidy on genome evolution.</p>

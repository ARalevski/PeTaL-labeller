Mode of action of a <i>Drosophila</i> FMRFamide in inducing muscle contraction
<p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a model system for examining the mechanisms of action of neuropeptides. DPKQDFMRFamide was previously shown to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscle fibres in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The present study examined the possible involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor and second messengers in mediating this myotropic effect after removal of the central nervous system. DPKQDFMRFamide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were reduced by 70% and 90%, respectively, in larvae with reduced expression of the <i>Drosophila Fmrf</i> receptor (FR) either ubiquitously or specifically in muscle tissue, compared with the response in control larvae in which expression was not manipulated. No such effect occurred in larvae with reduced expression of this gene only in neurons. The myogenic effects of DPKQDFMRFamide do not appear to be mediated through either of the two <i>Drosophila</i> myosuppressin receptors (<i>DmsR-1</i> and <i>DmsR-2</i>). DPKQDFMRFamide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were not reduced in Ala1 transgenic flies lacking activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamKII), and were not affected by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. Peptide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions in the mutants of the phospholipase C-β (<i>PLC</i>β) gene (<i>norpA</i> larvae) and in IP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants were similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions elicited in control larvae. The peptide failed to increase cAMP and cGMP levels in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscles. Peptide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were not potentiated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and were not antagonized by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent or cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Additionally, exogenous application of arachidonic acid failed to induce myogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions. Thus, DPKQDFMRFamide induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions via a G-protein coupled FMRFamide receptor in muscle cells but does not appear to act via cAMP, cGMP, IP<sub>3</sub>, PLC, CaMKII or arachidonic acid.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion increases propulsive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion speed or increase aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision   arthroplasty surgery.

A chemical genetic roadmap to improved tomato flavor
<p>Modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>al tomato varieties are substantially less flavorful than heirloom varieties. To understand and ultimately correct this deficiency, we quantified flavor-associated chemicals in 398 modern, heirloom, and wild accessions. A subset of these accessions was evaluated in consumer panels, identifying the chemicals that made the most important contributions to flavor and consumer liking. We found that modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>al varieties contain significantly lower amounts of many of these important flavor chemicals than older varieties. Whole-genome sequencing and a genome-wide association study permitted identification of genetic loci that affect most of the target flavor chemicals, including sugars, acids, and volatiles. Together, these results provide an understanding of the flavor deficiencies in modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>al varieties and the information necessary for the recovery of good flavor through molecular breeding.</p>

RSK2 contributes to myogenic vasoconstriction of resistance arteries by activating smooth muscle myosin and the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger
<p>Smooth muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion is triggered when Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylates the regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC<sub>20</sub>). However, blood vessels from <i>Mlck</i>-deficient mouse embryos retain the ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>, suggesting the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms. We showed that the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) also phosphorylated RLC<sub>20</sub> to promote smooth muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ility. Active, phosphorylated RSK2 was present in mouse resistance arteries under normal basal tone, and phosphorylation of RSK2 increased with myogenic vasoconstriction or agonist stimulation. Resistance arteries from <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice were dilated and showed reduced myogenic tone and RLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation. RSK2 phosphorylated Ser<sup>19</sup> in RLC in vitro. In addition, RSK2 phosphorylated an activating site in the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (NHE-1), resulting in cytosolic alkalinization and an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> that promotes vasoconstriction. NHE-1 activity increased upon myogenic constriction, and the increase in intracellular pH was suppressed in <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice. In pressured arteries, RSK2-dependent activation of NHE-1 was associated with increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which would be expected to increase MLCK activity, thereby contributing to basal tone and myogenic responses. Accordingly, <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice had lower blood pressure than normal littermates. Thus, RSK2 mediates a pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ile signaling pathway that contributes to the regulation of basal vascular tone, myogenic vasoconstriction, and blood pressure and may be a potential therapeutic target in smooth muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ility disorders.</p>

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart pumps blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This pumping function is achieved through synchronous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion of billions of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular calcium. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly couple external electrical impulses to the triggering of calcium ion release from intracellular stores and subsequent activation of force-producing proteins, a process termed excitation-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion (E-C) coupling. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type calcium channel with the calcium-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the release of calcium ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold protein called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic calcium release during E-C coupling. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C coupling, reduced pumping capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and function as a transcription factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addition to its “day job” as a structural protein, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-crystal metals have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>al single-crystal metals are usually synthesized by bulk crystal growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-crystal metal foils by “contact-free annealing” from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>al polycrystalline foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane crystal orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the crystal lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-crystal metal foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Changes in Anthocyanin Production during Domestication of <i>Citrus</i>
<p>Mandarin (<i>Citrus reticulata</i>), citron (<i>Citrus medica</i>), and pummelo (<i>Citrus maxima</i>) are important species of the genus <i>Citrus</i> and parents of the interspecific hybrids that constitute the most familiar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>al varieties of <i>Citrus</i>: sweet orange, sour orange, clementine, lemon, lime, and grapefruit. Citron produces anthocyanins in its young leaves and flowers, as do species in genera closely related to <i>Citrus</i>, but mandarins do not, and pummelo varieties that produce anthocyanins have not been reported. We investigated the activity of the <i>Ruby</i> gene, which encodes a MYB transcription factor controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis, in different accessions of a range of <i>Citrus</i> species and in domesticated cultivars. A white mutant of lemon lacks functional alleles of <i>Ruby</i>, demonstrating that <i>Ruby</i> plays an essential role in anthocyanin production in <i>Citrus</i>. Almost all the natural variation in pigmentation by anthocyanins in <i>Citrus</i> species can be explained by differences in activity of the <i>Ruby</i> gene, caused by point mutations and deletions and insertions of transposable elements. Comparison of the allelic constitution of <i>Ruby</i> in different species and cultivars also helps to clarify many of the taxonomic relationships in different species of <i>Citrus</i>, confirms the derivation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>al varieties during domestication, elucidates the relationships within the subgenus <i>Papeda</i>, and allows a new genetic classification of mandarins.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Genomes of Two Bat Species with Long Constant Frequency Echolocation Calls
<p>Bats can perceive the world by using a wide range of sensory systems, and some of the systems have become highly specialized, such as auditory sensory perception. Among bat species, the Old World leaf-nosed bats and horseshoe bats (rhinolophoid bats) possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems. Here, we reported the whole-genome sequencing and <i>de novo</i> assembles of two rhinolophoid bats—the great leaf-nosed bat (<i>Hipposideros armiger</i>) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus sinicus</i>). Comparative genomic analyses revealed the adaptation of auditory sensory perception in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some vision-related genes in rhinolophoid bats was observed, suggesting that these genes have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion of olfactory receptor gene repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory gene might have direct consequences for genes controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population genetic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-sequenced the genome of 20 great leaf-nosed bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, evidence of genetic adaptations to high altitudes in the great leaf-nosed bats was observed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the evolution of bats.</p>

Microtubule-Mediated Defects in Junctophilin-2 Trafficking Contribute to Myocyte Transverse-Tubule Remodeling and Ca<sup>2+</sup> Handling Dysfunction in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Cardiac dysfunction in failing hearts of human patients and animal models is associated with both microtubule densification and transverse-tubule (T-tubule) remodeling. Our objective was to investigate whether microtubule densification contributes to T-tubule remodeling and excitation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion coupling dysfunction in heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>In a mouse model of pressure overload–induced cardiomyopathy by transaortic banding, colchicine, a microtubule depolymerizer, significantly ameliorated T-tubule remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. In cultured cardiomyocytes, microtubule depolymerization with nocodazole or colchicine profoundly attenuated T-tubule impairment, whereas microtubule polymerization/stabilization with taxol accelerated T-tubule remodeling. In situ immunofluorescence of heart tissue sections demonstrated significant disorganization of junctophilin-2 (JP2), a protein that bridges the T-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, in transaortic banded hearts as well as in human failing hearts, whereas colchicine injection significantly preserved the distribution of JP2 in transaortic banded hearts. In isolated mouse cardiomyocytes, prolonged culture or treatment with taxol resulted in pronounced redistribution of JP2 from T-tubules to the peripheral plasma membrane, without changing total JP2 expression. Nocodazole treatment antagonized JP2 redistribution. Moreover, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of kinesin 1, a microtubule motor protein responsible for anterograde trafficking of proteins, protected against JP2 redistribution and T-tubule remodeling in culture. Finally, nocodazole treatment improved Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in cultured myocytes by increasing the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and reducing the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion—</title><p>Our data identify a mechanistic link between microtubule densification and T-tubule remodeling and reveal microtubule-mediated JP2 redistribution as a novel mechanism for T-tubule disruption, loss of excitation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion coupling, and heart failure.</p></sec>

Parental DNA Methylation States Are Associated with Heterosis in Epigenetic Hybrids
<p>Despite the importance and wide exploitation of heterosis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>al crop breeding, the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not completely understood. Recent studies have implicated changes in DNA methylation and small RNAs in hybrid performance; however, it remains unclear whether epigenetic changes are a cause or a consequence of heterosis. Here, we analyze a large panel of over 500 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) epigenetic hybrid plants (epiHybrids), which we derived from near-isogenic but epigenetically divergent parents. This proof-of-principle experimental system allowed us to quantify the contribution of parental methylation differences to heterosis. We measured traits such as leaf area, growth rate, flowering time, main stem branching, rosette branching, and final plant height and observed several strong positive and negative heterotic phenotypes among the epiHybrids. Using an epigenetic quantitative trait locus mapping approach, we were able to identify specific differentially methylated regions in the parental genomes that are associated with hybrid performance. Sequencing of methylomes, transcriptomes, and genomes of selected parent-epiHybrid combinations further showed that these parental differentially methylated regions most likely mediate the remodeling of methylation and transcriptional states at specific loci in the hybrids. Taken together, our data suggest that locus-specific epigenetic divergence between the parental lines can directly or indirectly trigger heterosis in Arabidopsis hybrids independent of genetic changes. These results add to a growing body of evidence that points to epigenetic factors as one of the key determinants of hybrid performance.</p>

Coexpression Analysis Identifies Two Oxidoreductases Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Monoterpene Acid Moiety of Natural Pyrethrin Insecticides in <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>
<p>Flowers of <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i> produce a set of compounds known collectively as pyrethrins, which are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>ally important pesticides that are strongly toxic to flying insects but not to most vertebrates. A pyrethrin molecule is an ester consisting of either trans-chrysanthemic acid or its modified form, pyrethric acid, and one of three alcohols, jasmolone, pyrethrolone, and cinerolone, that appear to be derived from jasmonic acid. Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), the first enzyme involved in the synthesis of trans-chrysanthemic acid, was characterized previously and its gene isolated. <i>TcCDS</i> produces free trans-chrysanthemol in addition to trans-chrysanthemyl diphosphate, but the enzymes responsible for the conversion of trans-chrysanthemol to the corresponding aldehyde and then to the acid have not been reported. We used an RNA sequencing-based approach and coexpression correlation analysis to identify several candidate genes encoding putative trans-chrysanthemol and trans-chrysanthemal dehydrogenases. We functionally characterized the proteins encoded by these genes using a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and heterologous expression in planta to demonstrate that <i>TcADH2</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemol to trans-chrysanthemal, while <i>TcALDH1</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemal into trans-chrysanthemic acid. Transient coexpression of <i>TcADH2</i> and <i>TcALDH1</i> together with <i>TcCDS</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves results in the production of trans-chrysanthemic acid as well as several other side products. The majority (58%) of trans-chrysanthemic acid was glycosylated or otherwise modified. Overall, these data identify key steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins and demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic engineering to produce components of these defense compounds in a heterologous host.</p>

Bioenergetics of Monoterpenoid Essential Oil Biosynthesis in Nonphotosynthetic Glandular Trichomes
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>ally important essential oils of peppermint (<i>Mentha</i> × <i>piperita</i>) and its relatives in the mint family (Lamiaceae) are accumulated in specialized anatomical structures called glandular trichomes (GTs). A genome-scale stoichiometric model of secretory phase metabolism in peppermint GTs was constructed based on current biochemical and physiological knowledge. Fluxes through the network were predicted based on metabolomic and transcriptomic data. Using simulated reaction deletions, this model predicted that two processes, the regeneration of ATP and ferredoxin (in its reduced form), exert substantial control over flux toward monoterpenes. Follow-up biochemical assays with isolated GTs indicated that oxidative phosphorylation and ethanolic fermentation were active and that cooperation to provide ATP depended on the concentration of the carbon source. We also report that GTs with high flux toward monoterpenes express, at very high levels, genes coding for a unique pair of ferredoxin and ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup> reductase isoforms. This study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence of how bioenergetic processes determine flux through monoterpene biosynthesis in GTs.</p>

Higher Novel L-Cys Degradation Activity Results in Lower Organic-S and Biomass in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than the Related Saltwort, <i>Salicornia</i>
<p><i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i> are almost identical halophytes whose edible succulent shoots hold promise for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>al production in saline water. Enhanced sulfur nutrition may be beneficial to crops naturally grown on high sulfate. However, little is known about sulfate nutrition in halophytes. Here we show that <i>Salicornia europaea</i> (ecotype RN) exhibits a significant increase in biomass and organic-S accumulation in response to supplemental sulfate, whereas <i>Sarcocornia fruticosa</i> (ecotype VM) does not, instead exhibiting increased sulfate accumulation. We investigated the role of two pathways on organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcoconia</i>: the sulfate reductive pathway that generates Cys and <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase that degrades Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, and pyruvate. The major function of <i>O</i>-acetyl-Ser-(thiol) lyase (OAS-TL; EC 2.5.1.47) is the formation of <sc>l</sc>-Cys, but our study shows that the OAS-TL A and OAS-TL B of both halophytes are enzymes that also degrade <sc>l</sc>-Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S. This activity was significantly higher in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than in <i>Salicornia</i>, especially upon sulfate supplementation. The activity of the sulfate reductive pathway key enzyme, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase (APR, EC 1.8.99.2), was significantly higher in <i>Salicornia</i> than in <i>Sarcocornia</i>. These results suggest that the low organic-S level in <i>Sarcocornia</i> is the result of high <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate by OAS-TLs, whereas the greater organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> is the result of higher APR activity and low <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate, resulting in higher net Cys biosynthesis. These results present an initial road map for halophyte growers to attain better growth rates and nutritional value of <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i>.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a biological system with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical biology. Small molecules are used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>ally as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in screens designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

The Accumulation of miRNAs Differentially Modulated by Drought Stress Is Affected by Grafting in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is routinely grafted, and rootstocks inducing drought tolerance represent a source for adapting vineyards to climate change in temperate areas. Our goal was to investigate drought stress effects on microRNA (miRNA) abundance in a drought-resistant grapevine rootstock, M4 (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> × <i>Vitis berlandieri</i>), compared with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>al cultivar, Cabernet Sauvignon, using their autografts and reciprocal grafts. RNA extracted from roots and leaves of droughted and irrigated plants of different graft combinations was used to prepare cDNA libraries for small RNA sequencing and to analyze miRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Measurements of leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange, and root hydraulic conductance attested that, under irrigation, M4 reduced water loss in comparison with cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon mostly through nonhydraulic, root-specific mechanisms. Under drought, stomatal conductance decreased at similar levels in the two genotypes. Small RNA sequencing allowed the identification of 70 conserved miRNAs and the prediction of 28 novel miRNAs. Different accumulation trends of miRNAs, observed upon drought and in different genotypes and organs, were confirmed by RT-qPCR. Corresponding target transcripts, predicted in silico and validated by RT-qPCR, often showed opposite expression profiles than the related miRNAs. Drought effects on miRNA abundance differed between the two genotypes. Furthermore, the concentration of drought-responsive miRNAs in each genotype was affected by reciprocal grafting, suggesting either the movement of signals inducing miRNA expression in the graft partner or, possibly, miRNA transport between scion and rootstock.

Bioorthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) Enables Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein Synthesis in Native Plant Tissue
<p>Proteomic plasticity undergirds stress responses in plants, and understanding such responses requires accurate measurement of the extent to which proteins levels are adjusted to counter external stimuli. Here, we adapt bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to interrogate protein synthesis in vegetative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. BONCAT relies on the translational incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid probe into cellular proteins. In this study, the probe is the Met surrogate azidohomoalanine (Aha), which carries a reactive azide moiety in its amino acid side chain. The azide handle in Aha can be selectively conjugated to dyes and functionalized beads to enable visualization and enrichment of newly synthesized proteins. We show that BONCAT is sensitive enough to detect Arabidopsis proteins synthesized within a 30-min interval defined by an Aha pulse and that the method can be used to detect proteins made under conditions of light stress, osmotic shock, salt stress, heat stress, and recovery from heat stress. We further establish that BONCAT can be coupled to tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins synthesized during heat stress and recovery from heat stress. Our results are consistent with a model in which, upon the onset of heat stress, translation is rapidly reprogrammed to enhance the synthesis of stress mitigators and is again altered during recovery. All experiments were carried out with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>ally available reagents, highlighting the accessibility of the BONCAT method to researchers interested in stress responses as well as translational and posttranslational regulation in plants.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the liquid-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ing muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production system, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing system or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing system or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing system. We suggest that sound production system demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Cold acclimation alters the connective tissue content of the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) heart
<p>Thermal acclimation can alter cardiac function and morphology in a number of fish species, but little is known about the regulation of these changes. The purpose of the present study was to determine how cold acclimation affects zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) cardiac morphology, collagen composition and connective tissue regulation. Heart volume, the thickness of the compact myocardium, collagen content and collagen fiber composition were compared between control (27°C) and cold-acclimated (20°C) zebrafish using serially sectioned hearts stained with Picrosirius Red. Collagen content and fiber composition of the pericardial membrane were also examined. Cold acclimation did not affect the volume of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ed heart; however, there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the compact myocardium. There was also a decrease in the collagen content of the compact myocardium and in the amount of thick collagen fibers throughout the heart. Cold-acclimated zebrafish also increased expression of the gene transcript for matrix metalloproteinase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and collagen Type I α1. We propose that the reduction in the thickness of the compact myocardium as well as the change in collagen content may help to maintain the compliance of the ventricle as temperatures decrease. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the zebrafish heart undergoes significant remodeling in response to cold acclimation.</p>

Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>
<p>The structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale have been well studied in animals with rigid skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in animals with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of mechanically important morphological features of the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> over an ontogenetic size range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that <i>L. terrestris</i> becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with size means that, when normalized for mass, adult worms gain ~117% mechanical advantage during radial expansion, compared with hatchling worms. We also found that the cross-sectional area of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 power across segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 power predicted by isometry. The cross-sectional area of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 power across segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage, we calculate that the force output generated during both circular and longitudinal muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion scales near isometry. We hypothesize that the allometric scaling of earthworms may reflect changes in soil properties and burrowing mechanics with size.</p>

From shape to cells: mouse models reveal mechanisms altering palate development in Apert syndrome
<p>Apert syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by severe skull malformations and caused by one of two missense mutations, S252W and P253R, on fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). The molecular bases underlying differential Apert syndrome phenotypes are still poorly understood and it is unclear why cleft palate is more frequent in patients carrying the S252W mutation. Taking advantage of Apert syndrome mouse models, we performed a novel combination of morphometric, histological and immunohistochemical analyses to precisely quantify distinct palatal phenotypes in <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> and <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></i> mice. We localized regions of differentially altered FGF signaling and assessed local cell patterns to establish a baseline for understanding the differential effects of these two <i>Fgfr2</i> mutations. Palatal suture scoring and comparative 3D shape analysis from high resolution μCT images of 120 newborn mouse skulls showed that <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> mice display relatively more severe palate dysmorphologies, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ed and more separated palatal shelves, a greater tendency to fuse the maxillary-palatine sutures and aberrant development of the inter-premaxillary suture. These palatal defects are associated with suture-specific patterns of abnormal cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The posterior region of the developing palate emerges as a potential target for therapeutic strategies in clinical management of cleft palate in Apert syndrome patients.</p>

Bloomsbury report on mouse embryo phenotyping: recommendations from the IMPC workshop on embryonic lethal screening
<p>Identifying genes that are important for embryo development is a crucial first step towards understanding their many functions in driving the ordered growth, differentiation and organogenesis of embryos. It can also shed light on the origins of developmental disease and congenital abnormalities. Current international efforts to examine gene function in the mouse provide a unique opportunity to pinpoint genes that are involved in embryogenesis, owing to the emergence of embryonic lethal knockout mutants. Through internationally coordinated efforts, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) has generated a public resource of mouse knockout strains and, in April 2012, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), supported by the EU InfraCoMP programme, convened a workshop to discuss developing a phenotyping pipeline for the investigation of embryonic lethal knockout lines. This workshop brought together over 100 scientists, from 13 countries, who are working in the academic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>al research sectors, including experts and opinion leaders in the fields of embryology, animal imaging, data capture, quality control and annotation, high-throughput mouse production, phenotyping, and reporter gene analysis. This article summarises the outcome of the workshop, including (1) the vital scientific importance of phenotyping embryonic lethal mouse strains for basic and translational research; (2) a common framework to harmonise international efforts within this context; (3) the types of phenotyping that are likely to be most appropriate for systematic use, with a focus on 3D embryo imaging; (4) the importance of centralising data in a standardised form to facilitate data mining; and (5) the development of online tools to allow open access to and dissemination of the phenotyping data.</p>

Runx1 Deficiency Protects Against Adverse Cardiac Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of heart failure and death worldwide. Preservation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ile function and protection against adverse changes in ventricular architecture (cardiac remodeling) are key factors to limiting progression of this condition to heart failure. Consequently, new therapeutic targets are urgently required to achieve this aim. Expression of the Runx1 transcription factor is increased in adult cardiomyocytes after MI; however, the functional role of Runx1 in the heart is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To address this question, we have generated a novel tamoxifen-inducible cardiomyocyte-specific <i>Runx1</i>-deficient mouse. Mice were subjected to MI by means of coronary artery ligation. Cardiac remodeling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ile function were assessed extensively at the whole-heart, cardiomyocyte, and molecular levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><i>Runx1</i>-deficient mice were protected against adverse cardiac remodeling after MI, maintaining ventricular wall thickness and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ile function. Furthermore, these mice lacked eccentric hypertrophy, and their cardiomyocytes exhibited markedly improved calcium handling. At the mechanistic level, these effects were achieved through increased phosphorylation of phospholamban by protein kinase A and relief of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase inhibition. Enhanced sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity in Runx1-deficient mice increased sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium content and sarcoplasmic reticulum–mediated calcium release, preserving cardiomyocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion after MI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data identified Runx1 as a novel therapeutic target with translational potential to counteract the effects of adverse cardiac remodeling, thereby improving survival and quality of life among patients with MI.</p></sec>

Dedifferentiation, Proliferation, and Redifferentiation of Adult Mammalian Cardiomyocytes After Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Adult mammalian hearts have a limited ability to generate new cardiomyocytes. Proliferation of existing adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs) is a potential source of new cardiomyocytes. Understanding the fundamental biology of ACM proliferation could be of great clinical significance for treating myocardial infarction (MI). We aim to understand the process and regulation of ACM proliferation and its role in new cardiomyocyte formation of post-MI mouse hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>β-Actin-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice and fate-mapping Myh6-MerCreMer-tdTomato/lacZ mice were used to trace the fate of ACMs. In a coculture system with neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, ACM proliferation was documented with clear evidence of cytokinesis observed with time-lapse imaging. Cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult mouse post-MI heart was detected by cell cycle markers and 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine incorporation analysis. Echocardiography was used to measure cardiac function, and histology was performed to determine infarction size.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vitro, mononucleated and bi/multinucleated ACMs were able to proliferate at a similar rate (7.0%) in the coculture. Dedifferentiation proceeded ACM proliferation, which was followed by redifferentiation. Redifferentiation was essential to endow the daughter cells with cardiomyocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ile function. Intercellular propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ing neonatal rat ventricular myocytes into ACM daughter cells was required to activate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cell signaling pathway to induce ACM redifferentiation. The properties of neonatal rat ventricular myocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients influenced the rate of ACM redifferentiation. Hypoxia impaired the function of gap junctions by dephosphorylating its component protein connexin 43, the major mediator of intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation between cardiomyocytes, thereby impairing ACM redifferentiation. In vivo, ACM proliferation was found primarily in the MI border zone. An ischemia-resistant connexin 43 mutant enhanced the redifferentiation of ACM-derived new cardiomyocytes after MI and improved cardiac function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Mature ACMs can reenter the cell cycle and form new cardiomyocytes through a 3-step process: dedifferentiation, proliferation, and redifferentiation. Intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal from neighboring functioning cardiomyocytes through gap junctions induces the redifferentiation process. This novel mechanism contributes to new cardiomyocyte formation in post-MI hearts in mammals.</p></sec>

Contribution ranged from 66.3% for those with a high school level of education or less to 75.0% for those 18 to 29 years of age. Sodium inherent to food was the next highest contributor (14.2%), followed by salt added in home food preparation (5.6%) and salt added to food at the table (4.9%). Home tap water consumed as a beverage and dietary supplement and nonprescription antacids contributed minimally to sodium intake (<0.5% each).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Sodium added to food outside the home accounted for ≈70% of dietary sodium intake. This finding is consistent with the 2010 Institute of Medicine recommendation for reduction of sodium in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>ally processed foods as the primary strategy to reduce sodium intake in the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Lower Circulating Folate Induced by a Fidgetin Intronic Variant Is Associated With Reduced Congenital Heart Disease Susceptibility
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Folate deficiency is an independent risk factor for congenital heart disease (CHD); however, the maternal plasma folate level is paradoxically not a good diagnostic marker. Genome-wide surveys have identified variants of nonfolate metabolic genes associated with the plasma folate level, suggesting that these genetic polymorphisms are potential risk factors for CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To examine the effects of folate concentration-related variations on CHD risk in the Han Chinese population, we performed 3 independent case-control studies including a total of 1489 patients with CHD and 1745 control subjects. The expression of the Fidgetin (FIGN) was detected in human cardiovascular and decidua tissue specimens with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The molecular mechanisms were investigated by luciferase reporter assays, surface plasmon resonance, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. FIGN-interacting proteins were confirmed by tandem affinity purification and coimmunoprecipitation. Proteasome activity and metabolite concentrations in the folate pathway were quantified with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerci</span></strong>al proteasome activity assay and immunoassays, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The +94762G>C (rs2119289) variant in intron 4 of the <i>FIGN</i> gene was associated with significant reduction in CHD susceptibility (<i>P</i>=5.1×10<sup>−14</sup> for the allele, <i>P</i>=8.5×10<sup>–−13</sup> for the genotype). Analysis of combined samples indicated that CHD risks in individuals carrying heterozygous (GC) or homozygous (CC) genotypes were reduced by 44% (odds ratio [OR]=0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.47–0.67) and 66% (OR=0.34; 95% CI=0.23–0.50), respectively, compared with those with the major GG genotype. Minor C allele carriers who had decreased plasma folate levels exhibited significantly increased <i>FIGN</i> expression because the transcription suppressor CREB1 did not bind the alternative promoter of <i>FIGN</i> isoform X3. Mechanistically, increased FIGN expression led to the accumulation of both reduced folate carrier 1 and dihydrofolate reductase via inhibition of their proteasomal degradation, which promoted folate absorption and metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We report a previously undocumented finding that decreased circulating folate levels induced by increased folate transmembrane transport and utilization, as determined by the <i>FIGN</i> intronic variant, serves as a protective mechanism against CHD. Our results may explain why circulating folate levels do not have a good diagnostic value.</p></sec>

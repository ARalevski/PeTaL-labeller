CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart disease is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV disease (MVD), the cellular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart disease valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es including arginase-1 and resistin-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–1. Conditionally deleting the vascular cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart disease. We define key inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that drive MVD in this model, including Syk, TNF, interleukin-6, very late antigen–4, and vascular cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–1.</p></sec>

Remobilization of crustal carbon may dominate volcanic arc emissions
<p>The flux of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> into and out of Earth’s surface environment has implications for Earth’s climate and habitability. We compiled a global data set for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> and helium isotopes from volcanic arcs and demonstrated that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> isotope composition of mean global volcanic gas is considerably heavier, at –3.8 to –4.6 per mil (‰), than the canonical mid-ocean ridge basalt value of –6.0‰. The largest volcanic emitters outgas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> with higher δ<sup>13</sup>C and are located in mature continental arcs that have accreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate platforms, indicating that reworking of crustal limestone is an important source of volcanic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>. The fractional burial of organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> is lower than traditionally determined from a global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> isotope mass balance and may have varied over geological time, modulated by supercontinent formation and breakup.</p>

Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century
<p>Soil is the largest terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycle–climate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sink by 2100, yet the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used <sup>14</sup>C data from 157 globally distributed soil profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> by a factor of more than six (430 ± 50 years versus 3100 ± 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sequestration potential of soils by a factor of nearly two (40 ± 27%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dioxide dynamics.</p>

Long-term pattern and magnitude of soil carbon feedback to the climate system in a warming world
<p>In a 26-year soil warming experiment in a mid-latitude hardwood forest, we documented changes in soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycling to investigate the potential consequences for the climate system. We found that soil warming results in a four-phase pattern of soil organic matter decay and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere, with phases of substantial soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> loss alternating with phases of no detectable loss. Several factors combine to affect the timing, magnitude, and thermal acclimation of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> loss. These include depletion of microbially accessible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> pools, reductions in microbial biomass, a shift in microbial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> use efficiency, and changes in microbial community composition. Our results support projections of a long-term, self-reinforcing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> feedback from mid-latitude forests to the climate system as the world warms.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>s lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-efficient metabolism alongside the fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

Probing and imaging spin interactions with a magnetic single-molecule sensor
<p>Magnetic single atoms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are receiving intensifying research focus because of their potential as the smallest possible memory, spintronic, and qubit elements. Scanning probe microscopes used to study these systems have benefited greatly from new techniques that use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e-functionalized tips to enhance spatial and spectroscopic resolutions and enable new sensing capabilities. We demonstrate a microscopy technique that uses a magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e, Ni(cyclopentadienyl)<sub>2</sub>, adsorbed at the apex of a scanning probe tip, to sense exchange interactions with another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e adsorbed on a Ag(110) surface in a continuously tunable fashion in all three spatial directions. We further used the probe to image contours of exchange interaction strength, revealing angstrom-scale regions where the quantum states of two magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es strongly mix. Our results pave the way for new nanoscale imaging capabilities based on magnetic single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e sensors.</p>

Observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K + <sup>40</sup>K collisions
<p>Resonances in ultracold collisions involving heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are difficult to simulate theoretically and have proven challenging to detect. Here we report the observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold collisions between potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K) atoms and sodium-23–potassium-40 (<sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in the rovibrational ground state. We prepare the atoms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in various hyperfine levels of their ground states and observe the loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es as a function of the magnetic field. The atom-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e Feshbach resonances are identified by observing an enhancement of the loss.

The observed atom-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e Feshbach resonances at ultralow temperatures probe the three-body potential energy surface with exceptional resolution and will help to improve understanding of ultracold collisions.</p>

Contrasting carbon cycle responses of the tropical continents to the 2015–2016 El Niño
<p>The 2015–2016 El Niñño led to historically high temperatures and low precipitation over the tropics, while the growth rate of atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) was the largest on record.

Relative to the 2011 La Niññña, the pantropical biosphere released 2.5 ± 0.34 gigatons more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> into the atmosphere in 2015, consisting of approximately even contributions from three tropical continents but dominated by diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> exchange processes.

Tropical forests are a net carbon source based on aboveground measurements of gain and loss

Here we use 12 years (2003 to 2014) of MODIS pantropical satellite data to quantify net annual changes in the aboveground <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> density of tropical woody live vegetation, providing direct, measurement-based evidence that the world’s tropical forests are a net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> source of 425.2<bold> </bold>± 92.0 teragrams of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> per year (Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>).

Faster Decomposition Under Increased Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Limits Soil Carbon Storage

Interplay of growth rate and xylem plasticity for optimal coordination of carbon and hydraulic economies in <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> trees
<p>Efficient leaf water supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and tree growth. Renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> investment while growing taller, and any deficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> availability may result in increasing hydraulic constraints to water flow. Therefore, plants need to coordinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> assimilation and biomass allocation to guarantee an efficient and safe long-distance transport system. We tested the hypothesis that reduced branch elongation rates together with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-saving adjustments of xylem anatomy hydraulically compensate for the reduction in biomass allocation to xylem. We measured leaf biomass, hydraulic and anatomical properties of wood segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing (SG) and 10 fast growing (FG) <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> L. trees. Branches of SG trees had five times slower branch elongation rate (7 vs 35  cm year<sup>–1</sup>), and produced a higher leaf biomass (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). On the contrary, we found no differences between SG and FG trees in terms of leaf-specific conductivity (<i>P</i> > 0.05) and xylem safety (Ψ<sub>50</sub> ≈ −3.2  MPa). Slower elongation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> costs associated with growth, while maintaining similar leaf-specific conductivity and xylem safety.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the diffusion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average diffusion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e imaging analysis, we found that the diffusion of receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average diffusion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

Organometallic and radical intermediates reveal mechanism of diphthamide biosynthesis
<p>Diphthamide biosynthesis involves a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> bond-forming reaction catalyzed by a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme that cleaves a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-sulfur (C–S) bond in SAM to generate a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) radical. Using rapid freezing, we have captured an organometallic intermediate with an iron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> (Fe–C) bond between ACP and the enzyme’s [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the presence of the substrate protein, elongation factor 2, this intermediate converts to an organic radical, formed by addition of the ACP radical to a histidine side chain. Crystal structures of archaeal diphthamide biosynthetic radical SAM enzymes reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> of the SAM C–S bond being cleaved is positioned near the unique cluster Fe, able to react with the cluster. Our results explain how selective C–S bond cleavage is achieved in this radical SAM enzyme.</p>

Radical-polar crossover reactions of vinylboron ate complexes
<p>Vinyl boronic esters are valuable substrates for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. However, boron-substituted alkenes have drawn little attention as radical acceptors, and the radical chemistry of vinylboron ate complexes is underexplored. We show here that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> radicals add efficiently to vinylboron ate complexes and that their adduct radical anions undergo radical-polar crossover: A 1,2-alkyl/aryl shift from boron to the α-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sp<sup>2</sup> center provides secondary or tertiary alkyl boronic esters. In contrast to the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, a transition metal is not required, and two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> bonds are formed. The valuable boronic ester moiety remains in the product and can be used in follow-up chemistry, enlarging the chemical space of the method. The cascade uses commercial starting materials and provides access to perfluoroalkylated alcohols, γ-lactones, γ-hydroxy alkylnitriles, and compounds bearing quaternary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> centers.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a biological system with small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical biology. Small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es identified in screens designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

In this work, we have studied the acclimation strategies of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, a model green alga that can grow using various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sources and is thus an excellent system in which to study photosynthesis. Like other photosynthetic algae, it has evolved inducible mechanisms to adapt to conditions where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> supply is limiting. We have analyzed how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> availability influences the composition and organization of the photosynthetic apparatus and the capacity of the cells to acclimate to different light conditions. Using electron microscopy, biochemical, and fluorescence measurements, we show that differences in CO<sub>2</sub> availability not only have a strong effect on the induction of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-concentrating mechanisms but also change the acclimation strategy of the cells to light. For example, while cells in limiting CO<sub>2</sub> maintain a large antenna even in high light and switch on energy-dissipative mechanisms, cells in high CO<sub>2</sub> reduce the amount of pigments per cell and the antenna size. Our results show the high plasticity of the photosynthetic apparatus of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. This alga is able to use various photoacclimation strategies, and the choice of which to activate strongly depends on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> availability.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration
<p>Nanoporous two-dimensional materials are attractive for ionic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar nanofiltration but limited by insufficient mechanical strength over large areas. We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of atomically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es while blocking solute ions or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es to enable size-selective separation. The SWNT network physically separates the GNM into microsized islands and acts as the microscopic framework to support the GNM, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the atomically thin GNM. The resulting GNM/SWNT membranes show high water permeance and a high rejection ratio for salt ions or organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es, and they retain stable separation performance in tubular modules.</p>

Electrofluorochromism at the single-molecule level

Synthetic transcription elongation factors license transcription across repressive chromatin

Major role of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in dark ocean carbon fixation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixation by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the dark ocean has a major impact on global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycling and ecological relationships in the ocean’s interior, but the relevant taxa and energy sources remain enigmatic. We show evidence that nitrite-oxidizing bacteria affiliated with the Nitrospinae phylum are important in dark ocean chemoautotrophy. Single-cell genomics and community metagenomics revealed that Nitrospinae are the most abundant and globally distributed nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in the ocean. Metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics analyses suggest that nitrite oxidation is the main pathway of energy production in Nitrospinae. Microautoradiography, linked with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization, indicated that Nitrospinae fix 15 to 45% of inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> in the mesopelagic western North Atlantic. Nitrite oxidation may have a greater impact on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycle than previously assumed.</p>

Atomic-layered Au clusters on α-MoC as catalysts for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction

We synthesized layered gold (Au) clusters on a molybdenum carbide (α-MoC) substrate to create an interfacial catalyst system for the ultralow-temperature WGS reaction. Water was activated over α-MoC at 303 kelvin, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> monoxide adsorbed on adjacent Au sites was apt to react with surface hydroxyl groups formed from water splitting, leading to a high WGS activity at low temperatures.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate secretion by the intestine generates luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283).

Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001).

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon

These regio- and diastereoselective processes enable convergent construction of type II polyketide substructures.</p>

Two-dimensional sp<sup>2</sup> carbon–conjugated covalent organic frameworks
<p>We synthesized a two-dimensional (2D) crystalline covalent organic framework (sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF) that was designed to be fully π-conjugated and constructed from all sp<sup>2</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>s by C=C condensation reactions of tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene and 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile. The C=C linkages topologically connect pyrene knots at regular intervals into a 2D lattice with π conjugations extended along both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions and develop an eclipsed layer framework rather than the more conventionally obtained disordered structures. The sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF is a semiconductor with a discrete band gap of 1.9 electron volts and can be chemically oxidized to enhance conductivity by 12 orders of magnitude. The generated radicals are confined on the pyrene knots, enabling the formation of a paramagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> structure with high spin density. The sp<sup>2</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> framework induces ferromagnetic phase transition to develop spin-spin coherence and align spins unidirectionally across the material.</p>

Second-scale nuclear spin coherence time of ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K molecules
<p>Coherence, the stability of the relative phase between quantum states, is central to quantum mechanics and its applications. For ultracold dipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es at sub-microkelvin temperatures, internal states with robust coherence are predicted to offer rich prospects for quantum many-body physics and quantum information processing. We report the observation of stable coherence between nuclear spin states of ultracold fermionic sodium-potassium (NaK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in the singlet rovibrational ground state. Ramsey spectroscopy reveals coherence times on the scale of 1 second; this enables high-resolution spectroscopy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar gas. Collisional shifts are shown to be absent down to the 100-millihertz level. This work opens the door to the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es as a versatile quantum memory and for precision measurements on dipolar quantum matter.</p>

ATP as a biological hydrotrope
<p>Hydrotropes are small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that solubilize hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in aqueous solutions. Typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es and differ from classical surfactants in that they have low cooperativity of aggregation and work at molar concentrations. Here, we show that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has properties of a biological hydrotrope. It can both prevent the formation of and dissolve previously formed protein aggregates. This chemical property is manifested at physiological concentrations between 5 and 10 millimolar. Therefore, in addition to being an energy source for biological reactions, for which micromolar concentrations are sufficient, we propose that millimolar concentrations of ATP may act to keep proteins soluble. This may in part explain why ATP is maintained in such high concentrations in cells.</p>

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals
<p>Multiple human diseases ensue from a hereditary or acquired deficiency of iron-transporting protein function that diminishes transmembrane iron flux in distinct sites and directions. Because other iron-transport proteins remain active, labile iron gradients build up across the corresponding protein-deficient membranes. Here we report that a small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e natural product, hinokitiol, can harness such gradients to restore iron transport into, within, and/or out of cells. The same compound promotes gut iron absorption in DMT1-deficient rats and ferroportin-deficient mice, as well as hemoglobinization in DMT1- and mitoferrin-deficient zebrafish. These findings illuminate a general mechanistic framework for small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–mediated site- and direction-selective restoration of iron transport. They also suggest that small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that partially mimic the function of missing protein transporters of iron, and possibly other ions, may have potential in treating human diseases.</p>

Synthesis of a carbon nanobelt
<p>The synthesis of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> nanobelt, comprising a closed loop of fully fused edge-sharing benzene rings, has been an elusive goal in organic chemistry for more than 60 years. Here we report the synthesis of one such compound through iterative Wittig reactions followed by a nickel-mediated aryl-aryl coupling reaction. The cylindrical shape of its belt structure was confirmed by x-ray crystallography, and its fundamental optoelectronic properties were elucidated by ultraviolet-visible absorption, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopic studies, as well as theoretical calculations. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e could potentially serve as a seed for the preparation of structurally well-defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> nanotubes.</p>

The whole-soil carbon flux in response to warming
<p>Soil organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> harbors three times as much <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> as Earth’s atmosphere, and its decomposition is a potentially large climate change feedback and major source of uncertainty in climate projections. The response of whole-soil profiles to warming has not been tested in situ. In a deep warming experiment in mineral soil, we found that CO<sub>2</sub> production from all soil depths increased with 4°C warming; annual soil respiration increased by 34 to 37%. All depths responded to warming with similar temperature sensitivities, driven by decomposition of decadal-aged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>. Whole-soil warming reveals a larger soil respiration response than many in situ experiments (most of which only warm the surface soil) and models.</p>

Reversion of antibiotic resistance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> by spiroisoxazoline SMARt-420
<p>Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to human health globally. Alarmingly, multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> have now spread worldwide. Some key antituberculosis antibiotics are prodrugs, for which resistance mechanisms are mainly driven by mutations in the bacterial enzymatic pathway required for their bioactivation. We have developed drug-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that activate a cryptic alternative bioactivation pathway of ethionamide in <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, circumventing the classic activation pathway in which resistance mutations have now been observed. The first-of-its-kind <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e, named SMARt-420 (Small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e Aborting Resistance), not only fully reverses ethionamide-acquired resistance and clears ethionamide-resistant infection in mice, it also increases the basal sensitivity of bacteria to ethionamide.</p>

Permanent human occupation of the central Tibetan Plateau in the early Holocene
<p>Current models of the peopling of the higher-elevation zones of the Tibetan Plateau postulate that permanent occupation could only have been facilitated by an agricultural lifeway at ~3.6 thousand calibrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-14 years before present. Here we report a reanalysis of the chronology of the Chusang site, located on the central Tibetan Plateau at an elevation of ~4270 meters above sea level. The minimum age of the site is fixed at ~7.4 thousand years (thorium-230/uranium dating), with a maximum age between ~8.20 and 12.67 thousand calibrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-14 years before present (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-14 assays). Travel cost modeling and archaeological data suggest that the site was part of an annual, permanent, preagricultural occupation of the central plateau. These findings challenge current models of the occupation of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>

Synthesis of resveratrol tetramers via a stereoconvergent radical equilibrium
<p>Persistent free radicals have become indispensable in the synthesis of organic materials through living radical polymerization. However, examples of their use in the synthesis of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are rare. Here, we report the application of persistent radical and quinone methide intermediates to the synthesis of the resveratrol tetramers nepalensinol B and vateriaphenol C. The spontaneous cleavage and reconstitution of exceptionally weak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> bonds has enabled a stereoconvergent oxidative dimerization of racemic materials in a transformation that likely coincides with the biogenesis of these natural products. The efficient synthesis of higher-order oligomers of resveratrol will facilitate the biological studies necessary to elucidate their mechanism(s) of action.</p>

Directed evolution of cytochrome c for carbon–silicon bond formation: Bringing silicon to life
<p>Enzymes that catalyze <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>–silicon bond formation are unknown in nature, despite the natural abundance of both elements. Such enzymes would expand the catalytic repertoire of biology, enabling living systems to access chemical space previously only open to synthetic chemistry. We have discovered that heme proteins catalyze the formation of organosilicon compounds under physiological conditions via carbene insertion into silicon–hydrogen bonds. The reaction proceeds both in vitro and in vivo, accommodating a broad range of substrates with high chemo- and enantioselectivity. Using directed evolution, we enhanced the catalytic function of cytochrome c from <i>Rhodothermus marinus</i> to achieve more than 15-fold higher turnover than state-of-the-art synthetic catalysts. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>–silicon bond-forming biocatalyst offers an environmentally friendly and highly efficient route to producing enantiopure organosilicon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic enzymes, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathway databases for 22 species and identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could generate a specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Exercise-Induced Changes in Glucose Metabolism Promote Physiological Cardiac Growth

To assess the relevance of changes in glycolytic activity, we determined how cardiac-specific expression of mutant forms of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase affect cardiac structure, function, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, and gene programs relevant to cardiac remodeling. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic and transcriptomic screenings were used to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways and gene sets regulated by glycolytic activity in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Exercise acutely decreased glucose utilization via glycolysis by modulating circulating substrates and reducing phosphofructokinase activity; however, in the recovered state following exercise adaptation, there was an increase in myocardial phosphofructokinase activity and glycolysis. In mice, cardiac-specific expression of a kinase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase transgene (Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice) lowered glycolytic rate and regulated the expression of genes known to promote cardiac growth. Hearts of Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice had larger myocytes, enhanced cardiac function, and higher capillary-to-myocyte ratios. Expression of phosphatase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase in the heart (Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> mice) increased glucose utilization and promoted a more pathological form of hypertrophy devoid of transcriptional activation of the physiological cardiac growth program. Modulation of phosphofructokinase activity was sufficient to regulate the glucose–fatty acid cycle in the heart; however, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic inflexibility caused by invariantly low or high phosphofructokinase activity caused modest mitochondrial damage. Transcriptomic analyses showed that glycolysis regulates the expression of key genes involved in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Exercise-induced decreases in glycolytic activity stimulate physiological cardiac remodeling, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flexibility is important for maintaining mitochondrial health in the heart.</p></sec>

Crystal structure of a TAPBPR–MHC I complex reveals the mechanism of peptide editing in antigen presentation
<p>Central to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated immunity is the recognition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e–major histocompatibility complex class I (p–MHC I) proteins displayed by antigen-presenting cells. Chaperone-mediated loading of high-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es onto MHC I is a key step in the MHC I antigen presentation pathway. However, the structure of MHC I with a chaperone that facilitates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e loading has not been determined. We report the crystal structure of MHC I in complex with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e editor TAPBPR (TAP-binding protein–related), a tapasin homolog. TAPBPR remodels the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e-binding groove of MHC I, resulting in the release of low-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e. Changes include groove relaxation, modifications of key binding pockets, and domain adjustments. This structure captures a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e-receptive state of MHC I and provides insights into the mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e editing by TAPBPR and, by analogy, tapasin.</p>

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic theory of pulmonary hypertension (PH) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (PH-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, accompanied by an increased ratio of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic alterations in PH-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in PH-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, which promotes glycolysis and proliferation even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe PH (PH-Fibs) and from normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; restoration of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic products were determined by mass spectrometry–based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs compared with normal subjects.

Furthermore, normalizing the PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown reversed the glycolytic phenotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell proliferation. Pharmacological manipulation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In PH, miR-124, through the alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 ratio, the overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells.

Separating host and microbiome contributions to drug pharmacokinetics and toxicity
<p>The gut microbiota is implicated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of many medical drugs, with consequences for interpersonal variation in drug efficacy and toxicity. However, quantifying microbial contributions to drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism is challenging, particularly in cases where host and microbiome perform the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic transformation. We combined gut commensal genetics with gnotobiotics to measure brivudine drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism across tissues in mice that vary in a single microbiome-encoded enzyme. Informed by these measurements, we built a pharmacokinetic model that quantitatively predicts microbiome contributions to systemic drug and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite exposure, as a function of bioavailability, host and microbial drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>izing activity, drug and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite absorption, and intestinal transit kinetics. Clonazepam studies illustrate how this approach disentangles microbiome contributions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of drugs subject to multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic routes and transformations.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers including small-molecules and neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Altered lipid homeostasis in <i>Drosophila</i> InsP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants leads to obesity and hyperphagia
<p>Obesity is a complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic disorder that often manifests with a strong genetic component in humans. However, the genetic basis for obesity and the accompanying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic syndrome is poorly defined. At a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic level, obesity arises from an imbalance between the nutritional intake and energy utilization of an organism. Mechanisms that sense the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic state of the individual and convey this information to satiety centers help achieve this balance. Mutations in genes that alter or modify such signaling mechanisms are likely to lead to either obese individuals, who in mammals are at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, or excessively thin individuals with accompanying health problems. Here we show that <i>Drosophila</i> mutants for an intracellular calcium signaling channel, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP<sub>3</sub>R) store excess triglycerides in their fat bodies and become unnaturally obese on a normal diet. Although excess insulin signaling can rescue obesity in InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutants to some extent, we show that it is not the only cause of the defect. Through mass spectrometric analysis of lipids we find that homeostasis of storage and membrane lipids are altered in InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutants. Possibly as a compensatory mechanism, InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutant adults also feed excessively. Thus, reduced InsP<sub>3</sub>R function alters lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and causes hyperphagia in adults. Together, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic and behavioral changes lead to obesity. Our results implicate altered InsP<sub>3</sub> signaling as a previously unknown causative factor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic syndrome in humans. Importantly, our studies also suggest preventive dietary interventions.</p>

The nuclear translocation of the kinases p38 and JNK promotes inflammation-induced cancer
<p>The stimulated nuclear translocation of signaling proteins, such as MAPKs, is a necessity for the initiation and regulation of their physiological functions. Previously, we determined that nuclear translocation of the MAPKs p38 and JNK involves binding to heterodimers comprising importin 3 and either importin 7 or importin 9. Here, we identified the importin-binding region in p38 and JNK and developed a myristoylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e targeting this site that we called PERY. The PERY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e specifically blocked the interaction of p38 and JNK with the importins, restricted their nuclear translocation, and inhibited phosphorylation of their nuclear (but not cytoplasmic) substrates. Through these effects, the PERY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e reduced the proliferation of several (but not all) cancer cell lines in culture and inhibited the growth of a human breast cancer xenograft in mice. In addition, the PERY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e substantially inhibited inflammation in mice, as manifested in models of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer. The PERY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e more effectively prevented colon cancer development than did a commercial p38 inhibitor. In vivo analysis further suggested that this effect was mediated by PERY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e–induced prevention of the nuclear translocation of p38 in macrophages. Together, these results support the use of the nuclear translocation of p38 and JNK as a novel drug target to treat various cancers and inflammation-induced diseases.</p>

Editing peptide presentation to T cells
<p>In mammals, two types of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, MHC I and MHC II, are found on the surface of cells in association with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es. If these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es are antigenic—that is, if they induce an immune response—the resulting MHC I–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e complexes are recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which are effector immune cells, whereas MHC II-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e complexes are recognized by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which facilitate both humoral and cellular immune responses.

Darkened Leaves Use Different Metabolic Strategies for Senescence and Survival
<p>In plants, an individually darkened leaf initiates senescence much more rapidly than a leaf from a whole darkened plant. Combining transcriptomic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic approaches in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we present an overview of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic strategies that are employed in response to different darkening treatments. Under darkened plant conditions, the perception of carbon starvation drove a profound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic readjustment in which branched-chain amino acids and potentially monosaccharides released from cell wall loosening became important substrates for maintaining minimal ATP production. Concomitantly, the increased accumulation of amino acids with a high nitrogen-carbon ratio may provide a safety mechanism for the storage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ically derived cytotoxic ammonium and a pool of nitrogen for use upon returning to typical growth conditions. Conversely, in individually darkened leaf, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic profiling that followed our <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment assays revealed a temporal and differential exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites, including sugars and amino acids, between the darkened leaf and the rest of the plant. This active transport could be the basis for a progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic shift in the substrates fueling mitochondrial activities, which are central to the catabolic reactions facilitating the retrieval of nutrients from the senescing leaf. We propose a model illustrating the specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic strategies employed by leaves in response to these two darkening treatments, which support either rapid senescence or a strong capacity for survival.</p>

Glutathione Transferase U13 Functions in Pathogen-Triggered Glucosinolate Metabolism<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Glutathione (GSH) and indole glucosinolates (IGs) exert key functions in the immune system of the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Appropriate GSH levels are important for execution of both pre- and postinvasive disease resistance mechanisms to invasive pathogens, whereas an intact PENETRATION2 (PEN2)-pathway for IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism is essential for preinvasive resistance in this species. Earlier indirect evidence suggested that the latter pathway involves conjugation of GSH with unstable products of IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and further processing of the resulting adducts to biologically active molecules. Here we describe the identification of Glutathione-<i>S</i>-Transferase class-tau member 13 (GSTU13) as an indispensable component of the PEN2 immune pathway for IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. <i>gstu13</i> mutant plants are defective in the pathogen-triggered biosynthesis of end products of the PEN2 pathway, including 4-O-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosyl-indol-3-yl formamide, indole-3-ylmethyl amine, and raphanusamic acid. In line with this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic defect, lack of functional GSTU13 results in enhanced disease susceptibility toward several fungal pathogens including <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>, <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>, and <i>Plectosphaerella cucumerina</i>. Seedlings of <i>gstu13</i> plants fail also to deposit the (1,3)-β-glucan cell wall polymer, callose, after recognition of the bacterial flg22 epitope. We show that GSTU13 mediates specifically the role of GSH in IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism without noticeable impact on other immune functions of this tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e. We postulate that GSTU13 connects GSH with the pathogen-triggered PEN2 pathway for IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism to deliver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites that may have numerous functions in the innate immune system of Arabidopsis.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites. Several combinations of exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites previously suggested in the literature.

WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diuresi</span></strong>s (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diuresi</span></strong>s of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">renal funct</span></strong>ion commonly encountered with aggressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diuresi</span></strong>s are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the structural space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e macrocycles lack regular secondary structures and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local structures not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable structures that can be adopted by macrocyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es composed of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence design and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 designs predicted to fold into single stable structures, many times more than the number of currently available unbound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e macrocycle structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of 9 of 12 designed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic designs, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of structures possible for short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug design and library selection methods.</p>

Structure of the TAPBPR–MHC I complex defines the mechanism of peptide loading and editing
<p>Adaptive immunity is shaped by a selection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es presented on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules. The chaperones Tapasin (Tsn) and TAP-binding protein–related (TAPBPR) facilitate MHC I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e loading and high-affinity epitope selection. Despite the pivotal role of Tsn and TAPBPR in controlling the hierarchical immune response, their catalytic mechanism remains unknown. Here, we present the x-ray structure of the TAPBPR–MHC I complex, which delineates the central step of catalysis. TAPBPR functions as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e selector by remodeling the MHC I α2-1-helix region, stabilizing the empty binding groove, and inserting a loop into the groove that interferes with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e binding. The complex explains how mutations in MHC I–specific chaperones cause defects in antigen processing and suggests a unifying mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e proofreading.</p>

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been achieved via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic engineering in cereals, but the potential connection between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic engineering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of engineered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely linked with dark-brown endosperm color in HFL rice. A functional connection between serotonin and endosperm color was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with serotonin accumulation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic connection between Lys and serotonin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin accumulation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in rice. In addition, the finding that both Lys and serotonin accumulate in HFL rice grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable crop.</p>

Impaired Malate and Fumarate Accumulation Due to the Mutation of the Tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter Has Little Effects on Stomatal Behavior
<p>Malate is a central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite involved in a multiplicity of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways, being associated with mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and playing significant roles in stomatal movements. Vacuolar malate transport has been characterized at the molecular level and is performed by at least one carrier protein and two channels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) vacuoles. The absence of the Arabidopsis tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter (tDT) in the <i>tdt</i> knockout mutant was associated previously with an impaired accumulation of malate and fumarate in leaves. Here, we investigated the consequences of this lower accumulation on stomatal behavior and photosynthetic capacity as well as its putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic impacts. Neither the stomatal conductance nor the kinetic responses to dark, light, or high CO<sub>2</sub> were highly affected in <i>tdt</i> plants. In addition, we did not observe any impact on stomatal aperture following incubation with abscisic acid, malate, or citrate. Furthermore, an effect on photosynthetic capacity was not observed in the mutant lines. However, leaf mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism was affected in the <i>tdt</i> plants. Levels of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were altered, and increases in both light and dark respiration were observed. We conclude that manipulation of the tonoplastic organic acid transporter impacted mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, while the overall stomatal and photosynthetic capacity were unaffected.</p>

Distinct Mechanisms of the ORANGE Protein in Controlling Carotenoid Flux
<p>β-Carotene adds nutritious value and determines the color of many fruits, including melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>). In melon mesocarp, β-carotene accumulation is governed by the <i>Orange</i> gene (<i>CmOr</i>) golden single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) through a yet to be discovered mechanism. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), OR increases carotenoid levels by posttranscriptionally regulating phytoene synthase (PSY). Here, we identified a <i>CmOr</i> nonsense mutation (<i>Cmor</i>-lowβ) that lowered fruit β-carotene levels with impaired chromoplast biogenesis. <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ exerted a minimal effect on <i>PSY</i> transcripts but dramatically decreased PSY protein levels and enzymatic activity, leading to reduced carotenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flux and accumulation. However, the golden SNP was discovered to not affect PSY protein levels and carotenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flux in melon fruit, as shown by carotenoid and immunoblot analyses of selected melon genotypes and by using chemical pathway inhibitors. The high β-carotene accumulation in golden SNP melons was found to be due to a reduced further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of β-carotene. This was revealed by genetic studies with double mutants including <i>carotenoid isomerase</i> (<i>yofi</i>), a carotenoid-isomerase nonsense mutant, which arrests the turnover of prolycopene. The <i>yofi</i> F2 segregants accumulated prolycopene independently of the golden SNP. Moreover, <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ was found to inhibit chromoplast formation and chloroplast disintegration in fruits from 30 d after anthesis until ripening, suggesting that <i>CmOr</i> regulates the chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition. Taken together, our results demonstrate that <i>CmOr</i> is required to achieve PSY protein levels to maintain carotenoid biosynthesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flux but that the mechanism of the <i>CmOr</i> golden SNP involves an inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism downstream of β-carotene to dramatically affect both carotenoid content and plastid fate.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites showed dynamic changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites related to amino acid biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.</p>

Disclosing the Molecular Basis of the Postharvest Life of Berry in Different Grapevine Genotypes
<p>The molecular events that characterize postripening grapevine berries have rarely been investigated and are poorly defined. In particular, a detailed definition of changes occurring during the postharvest dehydration, a process undertaken to make some particularly special wine styles, would be of great interest for both winemakers and plant biologists. We report an exhaustive survey of transcriptomic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic responses in berries representing six grapevine genotypes subjected to postharvest dehydration under identical controlled conditions. The modulation of phenylpropanoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism clearly distinguished the behavior of genotypes, with stilbene accumulation as the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic event, although the transient accumulation/depletion of anthocyanins and flavonols was the prevalent variation in genotypes that do not accumulate stilbenes. The modulation of genes related to phenylpropanoid/stilbene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism highlighted the distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic plasticity of genotypes, allowing for the identification of candidate structural and regulatory genes. In addition to genotype-specific responses, a core set of genes was consistently modulated in all genotypes, representing the common features of berries undergoing dehydration and/or commencing senescence. This included genes controlling ethylene and auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism as well as genes involved in oxidative and osmotic stress, defense responses, anaerobic respiration, and cell wall and carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Several transcription factors were identified that may control these shared processes in the postharvest berry. Changes representing both common and genotype-specific responses to postharvest conditions shed light on the cellular processes taking place in harvested berries stored under dehydrating conditions for several months.</p>

Increased homeothermy during reproduction in a basal placental mammal
<p>Homeothermic endothermy, the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) using heat produced by elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, is energetically expensive. There is increasing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict homeothermy, allowed <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest-phase <i>T</i><sub>b</sub>. The high level of homeothermy observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that homeothermy allows for greater energetic output during reproduction (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by measuring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates over a range of ambient temperatures in both reproductive and non-reproductive greater hedgehog tenrecs (<i>Setifer setosus</i>), a physiologically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates and highest levels of <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During pregnancy and lactation, there was an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at ~25°C. However, whereas increases in resting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism were substantial below 20°C (up to 150% higher during reproduction), daytime rest-phase ambient temperatures at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, <i>S. setosus</i> provide an example for how relatively low-cost increases in homeothermy could have led to substantial increases in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young. The mechanisms necessary for increases in thermogenesis during reproduction would have further benefited the development of homeothermy in mammals.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart. The data imply that the endothelium controls cardiomyocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and function.</p></sec>

MicroRNA-146a was either genetically or pharmacologically knocked out or genetically overexpressed in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, overexpression of dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (DLST) in the murine heart was performed by means of an adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MicroRNA-146a was upregulated in whole heart tissue in multiple murine pressure overload models. Also, microRNA-146a levels were moderately increased in left ventricular biopsies of patients with aortic stenosis. Overexpression of microRNA-146a in cardiomyocytes provoked cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction in vivo, whereas genetic knockdown or pharmacological blockade of microRNA-146a blunted the hypertrophic response and attenuated cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Mechanistically, microRNA-146a reduced its target DLST—the E2 subcomponent of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, a rate-controlling tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme. DLST protein levels significantly decreased on pressure overload in wild-type mice, paralleling a decreased oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, whereas DLST protein levels and hence oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism were partially maintained in microRNA-146a knockout mice.

These features were not altered by the reconstitution of bone marrow cells from IDO<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Moreover, angiotensin II infusion instigated interferon-γ, which induced the expression of IDO and kynureninase and increased 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) levels in the plasma and aortas of Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice, but not in IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice.

mTOR regulates metabolic adaptation of APCs in the lung and controls the outcome of allergic inflammation
<p>Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) occupy diverse anatomical tissues, but their tissue-restricted homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, working with mouse models of inflammation, we found that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)–dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic adaptation was required at discrete locations. mTOR was dispensable for dendritic cell (DC) homeostasis in secondary lymphoid tissues but necessary to regulate cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and accumulation of CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs and alveolar macrophages in lung. Moreover, while numbers of mTOR-deficient lung CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs were not changed, they were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ically reprogrammed to skew allergic inflammation from eosinophilic T helper cell 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) to neutrophilic T<sub>H</sub>17 polarity. The mechanism for this change was independent of translational control but dependent on inflammatory DCs, which produced interleukin-23 and increased fatty acid oxidation. mTOR therefore mediates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic adaptation of APCs in distinct tissues, influencing the immunological character of allergic inflammation.</p>

Fructose-driven glycolysis supports anoxia resistance in the naked mole-rat
<p>The African naked mole-rat’s (<i>Heterocephalus glaber</i>) social and subterranean lifestyle generates a hypoxic niche. Under experimental conditions, naked mole-rats tolerate hours of extreme hypoxia and survive 18 minutes of total oxygen deprivation (anoxia) without apparent injury. During anoxia, the naked mole-rat switches to anaerobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism fueled by fructose, which is actively accumulated and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ized to lactate in the brain. Global expression of the GLUT5 fructose transporter and high levels of ketohexokinase were identified as molecular signatures of fructose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Fructose-driven glycolytic respiration in naked mole-rat tissues avoids feedback inhibition of glycolysis via phosphofructokinase, supporting viability. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rewiring of glycolysis can circumvent the normally lethal effects of oxygen deprivation, a mechanism that could be harnessed to minimize hypoxic damage in human disease.</p>

Root diffusion barrier control by a vasculature-derived peptide binding to the SGN3 receptor
<p>The root endodermis forms its extracellular diffusion barrier by developing ringlike impregnations called Casparian strips. A factor responsible for their establishment is the SCHENGEN3/GASSHO1 (SGN3/GSO1) receptor-like kinase. Its loss of function causes discontinuous Casparian strips. SGN3 also mediates endodermal overlignification of other Casparian strip mutants. Yet, without ligand, SGN3 function remained elusive. Here we report that <i>schengen2 (sgn2)</i> is defective in an enzyme sulfating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e ligands. On the basis of this observation, we identified two stele-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es (CASPARIAN STRIP INTEGRITY FACTORS, CIF1/2) that complement <i>sgn2</i> at nanomolar concentrations and induce Casparian strip mislocalization as well as overlignification—all of which depend on SGN3. Direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e binding to recombinant SGN3 identifies these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es as SGN3 ligands. We speculate that CIF1/2-SGN3 is part of a barrier surveillance system, evolved to guarantee effective sealing of the supracellular Casparian strip network.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant systemic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two systemic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts systemically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 systemic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor systemic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN systemic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

Branched-Chain Amino Acid Catabolism Impacts Triacylglycerol Homeostasis in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Nitrogen (N) starvation-induced triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, and its complex relationship with starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in algal cells, has been intensively studied; however, few studies have examined the interaction between amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and TAG biosynthesis. Here, via a forward genetic screen for TAG homeostasis, we isolated a <i>Chlamydomonas</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) mutant (<i>bkdE1α</i>) that is deficient in the E1α subunit of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omics analysis revealed a defect in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids in <i>bkdE1α</i>. Furthermore, this mutant accumulated 30% less TAG than the parental strain during N starvation and was compromised in TAG remobilization upon N resupply. Intriguingly, the rate of mitochondrial respiration was 20% to 35% lower in <i>bkdE1α</i> compared with the parental strains. Three additional knockout mutants of the other components of the BCKDH complex exhibited phenotypes similar to that of <i>bkdE1α</i>. Transcriptional responses of <i>BCKDH</i> to different N status were consistent with its role in TAG homeostasis. Collectively, these results indicate that branched-chain amino acid catabolism contributes to TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism by providing carbon precursors and ATP, thus highlighting the complex interplay between distinct subcellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>isms for oil storage in green microalgae.</p>

Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed systemic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in systemic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the systemic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the systemic response as well as in supporting the generation of different systemic signals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic response that encompassed local, systemic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the systemic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the systemically altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, systemic, and transport). These compounds could define a core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the systemic leaves. Our findings suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and systemic tissues play an important role in systemic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid systemic response of plants to light stress.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and lipids represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways interact to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that lipids can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty acid synthesis via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty acid peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic breakdown of fatty acids in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch synthesis and fatty acid turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane lipids, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty acid flux between the two lipid biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty acid β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty acid synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule proteins: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain amino acids or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. Lipid peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule proteins. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key nodule proteins: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and nodule senescence.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism switches from maintenance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

Trehalose 6-Phosphate Regulates Photosynthesis and Assimilate Partitioning in Reproductive Tissue<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) that expresses rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE1</i> (<i>TPP1</i>) from the rice <i>MADS6</i> promoter, which is active over the flowering period, produces higher yields than wild type. This yield increase occurs with or without drought conditions during flowering. To understand the mechanistic basis of the increased yield, we characterized gene expression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite profiles in leaves and developing female reproductive tissue, comprising florets, node, pith, and shank, over the flowering period with and without drought. The <i>MADS6</i> promoter was most active in the vasculature, particularly phloem companion cells in florets and pith, consistent with the largest decreases in trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) levels (2- to 3-fold) being found in pith and florets. Low T6P led to decreased gene expression for primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and increased gene expression for secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, particularly lipid-related pathways. Despite similar changes in gene expression, the pith and floret displayed opposing assimilate profiles: sugars, sugar phosphates, amino acids, and lipids increased in florets, but decreased in pith. Possibly explaining this assimilate distribution, seven <i>SWEET</i> genes were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic plants. SnRK1 activity and the expression of the gene for the SnRK1 beta subunit, expression of SnRK1 marker genes, and endogenous trehalose pathway genes were also altered. Furthermore, leaves of the transgenic maize maintained a higher photosynthetic rate for a longer period compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that decreasing T6P in reproductive tissues down-regulates primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and up-regulates secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, resulting in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite profiles in component tissues. Our data implicate T6P/ SnRK1 as a major regulator of whole-plant resource allocation for crop yield improvement.</p>

Predicting Dynamic Metabolic Demands in the Photosynthetic Eukaryote <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>
<p>Phototrophic organisms exhibit a highly dynamic proteome, adapting their biomass composition in response to diurnal light/dark cycles and nutrient availability. Here, we used experimentally determined biomass compositions over the course of growth to determine and constrain the biomass objective function (BOF) in a genome-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic model of <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> UTEX 395 over time. Changes in the BOF, which encompasses all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites necessary to produce biomass, influence the state of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic network thus directly affecting predictions. Simulations using dynamic BOFs predicted distinct proteome demands during heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth. Model-driven analysis of extracellular nitrogen concentrations and predicted nitrogen uptake rates revealed an intracellular nitrogen pool, which contains 38% of the total nitrogen provided in the medium for photoautotrophic and 13% for heterotrophic growth. Agreement between flux and gene expression trends was determined by statistical comparison. Accordance between predicted flux trends and gene expression trends was found for 65% of multisubunit enzymes and 75% of allosteric reactions. Reactions with the highest agreement between simulations and experimental data were associated with energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism.

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into biological systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic biology. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant biology. Novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In addition, an immediate HSR-independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In addition, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism drives TAG accumulation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in addition to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

3-Hydroxyisobutyrate Dehydrogenase Is Involved in Both, Valine and Isoleucine Degradation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>In plants, amino acid catabolism is especially relevant in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic stress situations (e.g. limited carbohydrate availability during extended darkness). Under these conditions, amino acids are used as alternative substrates for respiration. Complete oxidation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine (Ile), and valine (Val) in the mitochondria efficiently allows the formation of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways for BCAA breakdown are largely unknown so far in plants. A systematic search for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genes encoding proteins resembling enzymes involved in BCAA catabolism in animals, fungi, and bacteria as well as proteomic analyses of mitochondrial fractions from Arabidopsis allowed the identification of a putative 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, AtHDH1 (At4g20930), involved in Val degradation. Systematic substrate screening analyses revealed that the protein uses 3-hydroxyisobutyrate but additionally 3-hydroxypropionate as substrates. This points to a role of the enzyme not only in Val but possibly also in Ile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. At4g20930 knockdown plants were characterized to test this conclusion. Root toxicity assays revealed increased root growth inhibition of the mutants if cultivated in the presence of Val or Ile but not in the presence of leucine.

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support respiration. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism interact to support plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark respiration. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of respiration and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the respiration.</p>

Two Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases from <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Have Distinct Roles in Lipid Metabolism
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is important for environmental stress responses by eukaryotic microalgae. G3P is an essential precursor for glycerolipid synthesis and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in response to nutrient starvation. G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH) mediates G3P synthesis, but the roles of specific GPDH isoforms are currently poorly understood. Of the five GPDH enzymes in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> were shown to be induced by nutrient starvation and/or salt stress. Heterologous expression of GPD2, a putative chloroplastic GPDH, and GPD3, a putative cytosolic GPDH, in a yeast <i>gpd1</i>Δ mutant demonstrated the functionality of both enzymes. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> knockdown mutants for <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> showed no difference in growth but displayed significant reduction in TAG concentration compared with the wild type in response to phosphorus or nitrogen starvation. Overexpression of <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> gave distinct phenotypes. <i>GPD2</i> overexpression lines showed only subtle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic phenotypes and no significant alteration in growth. In contrast, <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines displayed significantly inhibited growth and chlorophyll concentration, reduced glycerol concentration, and changes to lipid composition compared with the wild type, including increased abundance of phosphatidic acids but reduced abundance of diglycerides, triglycerides, and phosphatidylglycerol lipids. This may indicate a block in the downstream glycerolipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism pathway in <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines. Thus, lipid engineering by GPDH modification may depend on the activities of other downstream enzyme steps. These results also suggest that GPD2 and GPD3 GPDH isoforms are important for nutrient starvation-induced TAG accumulation but have distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic functions.</p>

Unique Motifs and Length of Hairpin in Oleosin Target the Cytosolic Side of Endoplasmic Reticulum and Budding Lipid Droplet
<p>Plant cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) are covered with a layer of phospholipids and oleosin and were extensively studied before those in mammals and yeast. Oleosin has short amphipathic N- and C-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es flanking a conserved 72-residue hydrophobic hairpin, which penetrates and stabilizes the LD. Oleosin is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and extracts ER-budding LDs to cytosol. To delineate the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LD, we have expressed modified-oleosin genes in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> for transient expression and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY2 cells for stable transformation. The results have identified oleosin motifs for targeting ER-LD and oleosin as the sole molecule responsible for budding-LD entering cytosol. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es are not required for the targeting. The hairpin, including its entire length, initial N-portion residues, and hairpin-loop of three Pro and one Ser residues, as well as the absence of an N-terminal ER-targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e, are necessary for oleosin targeting ER and moving onto budding LDs and extracting them to cytosol. In a reverse approach, eliminations of these necessities allow the modified oleosin to enter the ER lumen and extract budding LDs to the ER lumen. Modified oleosin with an added vacuole signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e transports the ER-luminal LDs to vacuoles. The overall findings define the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LDs and extracting budding LDs to the cytosol as well as reveal potential applications.</p>

Repression of CYSTATHIONINE <i>γ</i>-SYNTHASE in Seeds Recruits the <i>S</i>-Methylmethionine Cycle
<p><i>S</i>-Methylmethionine (SMM) was suggested previously to participate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of methionine (Met) in seeds. To further reveal its roles, we had previously produced transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RNA interference (RNAi) seeds with lower transcript expression of CYSTATHIONINE γ-SYNTHASE (<i>AtCGS</i>), Met’s main regulatory enzyme. Unexpectedly, these seeds accumulated significantly higher levels of Met compared with control seeds through an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, transcript and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic analyses coupled with isotope-labeled [<sup>13</sup>C]SMM and [<sup>13</sup>C]Met feeding experiments enabled us to reveal that SMM that was synthesized in rosette leaves of RNAi plants significantly contributed to the accumulation of Met in their seeds at late stages of development. Seed-specific repression of <i>AtCGS</i> in RNAi seeds triggered the induction of genes operating in the SMM cycle of rosette leaves, leading to elevated transport of SMM toward the seeds, where higher reconversion rates of SMM to Met were detected. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rearrangements in RNAi seeds resulted in an altered sulfur-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, such as lower amounts of Cys and glutathione, as well as a differential composition of glucosinolates. Together, the data propose a novel cross talk existing between seeds and rosette leaves along with mutual effects between the Asp family and SMM pathways operating in these tissues. They also shed light on the effects of higher Met levels on seed physiology and behavior.</p>

ChloroKB: A Web Application for the Integration of Knowledge Related to Chloroplast Metabolic Network
<p>Higher plants, as autotrophic organisms, are effective sources of molecules. They hold great promise for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic engineering, but the behavior of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism at the network level is still incompletely described. Although structural models (stoichiometry matrices) and pathway databases are extremely useful, they cannot describe the complexity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic context, and new tools are required to visually represent integrated biocurated knowledge for use by both humans and computers. Here, we describe ChloroKB, a Web application (<ext-link>http://chlorokb.fr/</ext-link>) for visual exploration and analysis of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic network in the chloroplast and related cellular pathways. The network was manually reconstructed through extensive biocuration to provide transparent traceability of experimental data. Proteins and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites were placed in their biological context (spatial distribution within cells, connectivity in the network, participation in supramolecular complexes, and regulatory interactions) using CellDesigner software. The network contains 1,147 reviewed proteins (559 localized exclusively in plastids, 68 in at least one additional compartment, and 520 outside the plastid), 122 proteins awaiting biochemical/genetic characterization, and 228 proteins for which genes have not yet been identified. The visual presentation is intuitive and browsing is fluid, providing instant access to the graphical representation of integrated processes and to a wealth of refined qualitative and quantitative data. ChloroKB will be a significant support for structural and quantitative kinetic modeling, for biological reasoning, when comparing novel data with established knowledge, for computer analyses, and for educational purposes. ChloroKB will be enhanced by continuous updates following contributions from plant researchers.</p>

Dissecting the Metabolic Role of Mitochondria during Developmental Leaf Senescence
<p>The functions of mitochondria during leaf senescence, a type of programmed cell death aimed at the massive retrieval of nutrients from the senescing organ to the rest of the plant, remain elusive. Here, combining experimental and analytical approaches, we showed that mitochondrial integrity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is conserved until the latest stages of leaf senescence, while their number drops by 30%. Adenylate phosphorylation state assays and mitochondrial respiratory measurements indicated that the leaf energy status also is maintained during this time period. Furthermore, after establishing a curated list of genes coding for products targeted to mitochondria, we analyzed in isolation their transcript profiles, focusing on several key mitochondrial functions, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial electron transfer chain, iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, transporters, as well as catabolic pathways. In tandem with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic approach, our data indicated that mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism was reorganized to support the selective catabolism of both amino acids and fatty acids. Such adjustments would ensure the replenishment of α-ketoglutarate and glutamate, which provide the carbon backbones for nitrogen remobilization. Glutamate, being the substrate of the strongly up-regulated cytosolic glutamine synthase, is likely to become a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ically limiting factor in the latest stages of developmental leaf senescence. Finally, an evolutionary age analysis revealed that, while branched-chain amino acid and proline catabolism are very old mitochondrial functions particularly enriched at the latest stages of leaf senescence, auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism appears to be rather newly acquired. In summation, our work shows that, during developmental leaf senescence, mitochondria orchestrate catabolic processes by becoming increasingly central energy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic hubs.</p>

Class II Cytochrome P450 Reductase Governs the Biosynthesis of Alkaloids
<p>Expansion of the biosynthesis of plant specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites notably results from the massive recruitment of cytochrome P450s that catalyze multiple types of conversion of biosynthetic intermediates. For catalysis, P450s require a two-electron transfer catalyzed by shared cytochrome P450 oxidoreductases (CPRs), making these auxiliary proteins an essential component of specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. CPR isoforms usually group into two distinct classes with different proposed roles, namely involvement in primary and basal specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>isms for class I and inducible specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism for class II. By studying the role of CPRs in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids, we provide compelling evidence of an operational specialization of CPR isoforms in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> (Madagascar periwinkle). Global analyses of gene expression correlation combined with transcript localization in specific leaf tissues and gene-silencing experiments of both classes of CPR all point to the strict requirement of class II CPRs for monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthesis with a minimal or null role of class I. Direct assays of interaction and reduction of P450s in vitro, however, showed that both classes of CPR performed equally well. Such high specialization of class II CPRs in planta highlights the evolutionary strategy that ensures an efficient reduction of P450s in specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism.</p>

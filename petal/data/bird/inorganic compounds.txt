Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

An Aromatic Farnesyltransferase Functions in Biosynthesis of the Anti-HIV Meroterpenoid Daurichromenic Acid
<p><i>Rhododendron dauricum</i> produces daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid, via oxidative cyclization of the farnesyl group of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. The prenyltransferase (PT) that synthesizes grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is a farnesyltransferase in plant specialized metabolism. In this study, we demonstrated that the isoprenoid moiety of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is derived from the 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway that takes place in plastids. We explored candidate sequences of plastid-localized PT homologs and identified a cDNA for this PT, RdPT1, which shares moderate sequence similarity with known aromatic PTs. RdPT1 is expressed exclusively in the glandular scales, where daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> accumulates. In addition, the gene product was targeted to plastids in plant cells. The recombinant RdPT1 regiospecifically synthesized grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> from orsellinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and farnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating that RdPT1 is the farnesyltransferase involved in daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> biosynthesis. This enzyme strictly preferred orsellinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> as a prenyl acceptor, whereas it had a relaxed specificity for prenyl donor structures, also accepting geranyl and geranylgeranyl diphosphates with modest efficiency to synthesize prenyl chain analogs of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Such a broad specificity is a unique catalytic feature of RdPT1 that is not shared among secondary metabolic aromatic PTs in plants. We discuss the unusual substrate preference of RdPT1 using a molecular modeling approach. The biochemical properties as well as the localization of RdPT1 suggest that this enzyme produces meroterpenoids in glandular scales cooperatively with previously identified daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase, probably for chemical defense on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this compound in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidation. Both compounds preserved linolenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of lipids, carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is a chemical quencher of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidation, contrary to carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> takes place in planta.</p>

Metabolic recycling of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase supports breast cancer biomass
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> is a ubiquitous by-product of cellular metabolism; however, the biological consequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> production are not fully understood, especially in cancer. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> is not merely a toxic waste product but is recycled into central amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolism to maximize nitrogen utilization. In our experiments, human breast cancer cells primarily assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> through reductive amination catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH); secondary reactions enabled other amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, such as proline and aspartate, to directly acquire this nitrogen. Metabolic recycling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> accelerated proliferation of breast cancer. In mice, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> accumulated in the tumor microenvironment and was used directly to generate amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s through GDH activity. These data show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> is not only a secreted waste product but also a fundamental nitrogen source that can support tumor biomass.</p>

The <i>MicroRNA390</i>/<i>TRANS-ACTING SHORT INTERFERING RNA3</i> Module Mediates Lateral Root Growth under Salt Stress via the Auxin Pathway
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-induced developmental plasticity in a plant root system strongly depends on auxin signaling. However, the molecular events underlying this process are poorly understood. <i>MicroRNA390</i> (<i>miR390</i>), <i>trans-actin small interfering RNA</i>s (<i>tasiRNA</i>s), and <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs</i> (<i>ARFs</i>) form a regulatory module involved in controlling lateral root (LR) growth. Here, we found that <i>miR390</i> expression was strongly induced by exposure to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> during LR formation in poplar (<i>Populus</i> spp.) plants. <i>miR390</i> overexpression stimulated LR development and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance, whereas <i>miR390</i> knockdown caused by a short tandem target mimic repressed LR growth and compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> resistance. <i>ARF3.1</i>, <i>ARF3.2</i>, and <i>ARF4</i> expression was inhibited significantly by the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>, and transcript abundance was decreased dramatically in the <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing line but increased in the <i>miR390</i>-knockdown line. Constitutive expression of <i>ARF4m</i> harboring mutated <i>trans-acting small interfering ARF</i>-binding sites removed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> resistance of the <i>miR390</i> overexpressors. <i>miR390</i> positively regulated auxin signaling in LRs subjected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>, but <i>ARF4</i> inhibited auxin signaling. Salinity stabilized the poplar Aux/IAA repressor INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID17.1, and overexpression of an auxin/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-resistant form of this repressor suppressed LR growth in <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing and <i>ARF4</i>-RNA interfering lines in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>. Thus, the <i>miR390/TAS3/ARFs</i> module is a key regulator, via modulating the auxin pathway, of LR growth in poplar subjected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress.</p>

CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6: A Key Regulator of Na<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis during Germination
<p>Salinity impairs seed germination and seedling establishment. We investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6 (CAMTA6) in salinity stress responses during early germination. Compared with the wild type, the <i>camta6-4</i> and <i>camta6-5</i> mutants were more tolerant to NaCl and abscisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (ABA) and accumulated less Na<sup>+</sup>. In contrast, 4- to 11-d-old <i>camta6</i> seedlings were more sensitive to NaCl. In <i>camta6</i>, expression of <i>HIGH-AFFINITY K<sup>+</sup> TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>AtHKT1;1</i>), encoding an Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transporter, was restricted to the radicles and was not enhanced by NaCl or ABA. During germination, the <i>camta6 hkt1</i> double mutant was as sensitive as the wild type and <i>hkt1</i> to NaCl, suggesting that HKT1;1 is crucial for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance of <i>camta6</i>. An ABA response element in the <i>HKT1;1</i> promoter was found to be indispensable for the enhanced expression of the gene in response to NaCl and to ABA. Transcriptome analysis of the wild type and <i>camta6-5</i> with and without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> treatment revealed 1,020 up-regulated and 1,467 down-regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-responsive genes in the wild type. Among these, 638 up-regulated and 1,242 down-regulated genes were classified as CAMTA6-dependent. Expression of several known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress-associated genes, including <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i> and <i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ANTIPORTER</i>, was impaired in <i>camta6</i> mutants. Bioinformatics analysis of the 5′ upstream sequences of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-responsive CAMTA6-dependent up-regulated genes revealed the CACGTGTC motif as the most prominent element, representing an ABA response element and a potential CAMTA-binding site. We suggest that CAMTA6 regulates, directly or indirectly, the expression of most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-responsive genes in germinating seeds, including genes that are crucial for Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress tolerance.</p>

Linking Duplication of a Calcium Sensor to Salt Tolerance in <i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-OVERLY-SENSITIVE (SOS) pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) functions to prevent the toxic accumulation of sodium in the cytosol when plants are grown in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-affected soils. In this pathway, the CALCINEURIN B-LIKE10 (AtCBL10) calcium sensor interacts with the AtSOS2 kinase to activate the AtSOS1 plasma membrane sodium/proton exchanger. <i>CBL10</i> has been duplicated in Eutrema (<i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>), a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-tolerant relative of Arabidopsis. Because Eutrema maintains growth in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-affected soils that kill most crop plants, the duplication of <i>CBL10</i> provides a unique opportunity to functionally test the outcome of gene duplication and its link to plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance. In Eutrema, individual down-regulation of the duplicated <i>CBL10</i> genes (<i>EsCBL10a</i> and <i>EsCBL10b</i>) decreased growth in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> and, in combination, led to an even greater decrease, suggesting that both genes function in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> and have distinct functions. Cross-species complementation assays demonstrated that <i>EsCBL10b</i> has an enhanced ability to activate the SOS pathway while <i>EsCBL10a</i> has a function not performed by <i>AtCBL10</i> or <i>EsCBL10b</i>. Chimeric EsCBL10a/EsCBL10b proteins revealed that the specific functions of the EsCBL10 proteins resulted from changes in the amino terminus. The duplication of <i>CBL10</i> increased calcium-mediated signaling capacity in Eutrema and conferred increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-sensitive Arabidopsis.</p>

INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 Recruits Histone Deacetylase and a Transcriptional Repression Complex to Regulate Rice Salt Tolerance
<p>Perception and transduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress signals are critical for plant survival, growth, and propagation. Thus, identification of components of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress-signaling pathway is important for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) molecular breeding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress resistance. Here, we report the identification of an apetala2/ethylene response factor transcription factor INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 (IDS1) and its roles in the regulation of rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance. By genetic screening and phenotype analysis, we demonstrated that IDS1 conferred transcriptional repression activity and acted as a negative regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance in rice. To identify potential downstream target genes regulated by IDS1, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing and ChIP-quantitative PCR assays and found that IDS1 may directly associate with the GCC-box-containing motifs in the promoter regions of abiotic stress-responsive genes, including <i>LEA1</i> (<i>LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEIN1</i>) and <i>SOS1</i> (<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i>), which are key genes regulating rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance. IDS1 physically interacted with the transcriptional corepressor topless-related 1 and the histone deacetylase HDA1, contributing to the repression of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> expression. Analyses of histone H3 acetylation status and RNA polymerase II occupation on the promoters of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> further defined the molecular foundation of the transcriptional repression activity of IDS1. Our findings illustrate an epigenetic mechanism by which IDS1 modulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress signaling as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance in rice.</p>

Coexpression Analysis Identifies Two Oxidoreductases Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Monoterpene Acid Moiety of Natural Pyrethrin Insecticides in <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>
<p>Flowers of <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i> produce a set of compounds known collectively as pyrethrins, which are commercially important pesticides that are strongly toxic to flying insects but not to most vertebrates. A pyrethrin molecule is an ester consisting of either trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> or its modified form, pyrethric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and one of three alcohols, jasmolone, pyrethrolone, and cinerolone, that appear to be derived from jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), the first enzyme involved in the synthesis of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, was characterized previously and its gene isolated. <i>TcCDS</i> produces free trans-chrysanthemol in addition to trans-chrysanthemyl diphosphate, but the enzymes responsible for the conversion of trans-chrysanthemol to the corresponding aldehyde and then to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> have not been reported. We used an RNA sequencing-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d approach and coexpression correlation analysis to identify several candidate genes encoding putative trans-chrysanthemol and trans-chrysanthemal dehydrogenases. We functionally characterized the proteins encoded by these genes using a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and heterologous expression in planta to demonstrate that <i>TcADH2</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemol to trans-chrysanthemal, while <i>TcALDH1</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemal into trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Transient coexpression of <i>TcADH2</i> and <i>TcALDH1</i> together with <i>TcCDS</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves results in the production of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> as well as several other side products. The majority (58%) of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was glycosylated or otherwise modified. Overall, these data identify key steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins and demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic engineering to produce components of these defense compounds in a heterologous host.</p>

Network-Guided GWAS Improves Identification of Genes Affecting Free Amino Acids
<p>Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are essential for proper growth and development in plants. Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s serve as building blocks for proteins but also are important for responses to stress and the biosynthesis of numerous essential compounds. In seed, the pool of free amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s (FAAs) also contributes to alternative energy, desiccation, and seed vigor; thus, manipulating FAA levels can significantly impact a seed’s nutritional qualities. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on branched-chain amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s have identified some regulatory genes controlling seed FAAs, the genetic regulation of FAA levels, composition, and homeostasis in seeds remains mostly unresolved. Hence, we performed GWAS on 18 FAAs from a 313-ecotype Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) association panel. Specifically, GWAS was performed on 98 traits derived from known amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolic pathways (approach 1) and then on 92 traits generated from an unbiased correlation-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d metabolic network analysis (approach 2), and the results were compared. The latter approach facilitated the discovery of additional novel metabolic interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations not identified by the former approach. The most prominent network-guided GWAS signal was for a histidine (His)-related trait in a region containing two genes: a cationic amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transporter (CAT4) and a polynucleotide phosphorylase resistant to inhibition with fosmidomycin. A reverse genetics approach confirmed CAT4 to be responsible for the natural variation of His-related traits across the association panel. Given that His is a semiessential amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and a potent metal chelator, CAT4 orthologs could be considered as candidate genes for seed quality biofortification in crop plants.</p>

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be water permeable, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>−</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated water loss by reducing urine output, which led to a reduction (by 29–76%) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent reduction (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of water to flush the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea synthesis occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea synthesis occurred without the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> and total free amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, it can be deduced that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> production through amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> catabolism was suppressed with a proportional reduction in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in water, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> production, instead of increased urea synthesis, as the major strategy to ameliorate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure.</p>

Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Network Analysis Reveals a Role for Salicylic Acid Pathway Components in Shade Avoidance
<p>Plants have sophisticated mechanisms for sensing neighbor shade. To maximize their ability to compete for light, plants respond to shade through enhanced elongation and physiological changes. The shade avoidance response affects many different organs and growth stages, yet the signaling pathways underlying this response have mostly been studied in seedlings. We assayed transcriptome changes in response to shade across a 2-d time course in the wild type and 12 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants. The resulting temporal map of transcriptional responses to shade defines early and late responses in adult plants, enabling us to determine connections between key signaling genes and downstream responses. We found a pervasive and unexpectedly strong connection between shade avoidance and genes related to salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, suggesting salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> signaling to be an important shade avoidance growth regulator. We tested this connection and found that several mutants disrupting salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels or signaling were defective in shade avoidance. The effect of these mutations on shade avoidance was specific to petiole elongation; neither hypocotyl nor flowering time responses were altered, thereby defining important stage-specific differences in the downstream shade avoidance signaling pathway.

SENSITIVE TO SALT1, An Endoplasmic Reticulum-Localized Chaperone, Positively Regulates Salt Resistance
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress seriously affects plant growth and development. Through genetic screening, we identified and characterized an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>1</i> (<i>ses1</i>) mutant. <i>SES1</i> was ubiquitously expressed and induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> treatment. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-sensitive phenotype of <i>ses1</i> was due neither to the overaccumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> nor to the suppression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance-associated genes. <i>SES1</i> encoded an uncharacterized endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized protein. Coinciding with its subcellular distribution, <i>ses1</i> exhibited overactivation of unfolded protein response genes and was largely influenced by severe ER stress. Biochemical evidence revealed that SES1 functions as an important molecular chaperone to alleviate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-induced ER stress. Furthermore, the ER stress sensor basic leucine zipper factor17 transactivated <i>SES1</i> by binding directly to its promoter region. These results provide insights into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress responses and ER homeostasis and shed light on the mechanism by which <i>SES1</i> modulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> resistance.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and lipids represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that lipids can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch synthesis and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane lipids, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> flux between the two lipid biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

Time-Course Transcriptomics Analysis Reveals Key Responses of Submerged Deepwater Rice to Flooding
<p>Water submergence is an environmental factor that limits plant growth and survival. Deepwater rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) adapts to submergence by rapidly elongating its internodes and thereby maintaining its leaves above the water surface. We performed a comparative RNA sequencing transcriptome analysis of the shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> region, including basal nodes, internodes, and shoot apices of seedlings at two developmental stages from two varieties with contrasting deepwater growth responses. A transcriptomic comparison between deepwater rice cv C9285 and nondeepwater rice cv Taichung 65 revealed both similar and differential expression patterns between the two genotypes during submergence. The expression of genes related to gibberellin biosynthesis, trehalose biosynthesis, anaerobic fermentation, cell wall modification, and transcription factors that include ethylene-responsive factors was significantly different between the varieties. Interestingly, in both varieties, the jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content at the shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> decreased during submergence, while exogenous jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> inhibited submergence-induced internode elongation in cv C9285, suggesting that jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> plays a role in the submergence response of rice. Furthermore, a targeted de novo transcript assembly revealed transcripts that were specific to cv C9285, including submergence-induced biotic stress-related genes. Our multifaceted transcriptome approach using the rice shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> region illustrates a differential response to submergence between deepwater and nondeepwater rice. Jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolism appears to participate in the submergence-mediated internode elongation response of deepwater rice.</p>

Ethylene Signaling Modulates Cortical Microtubule Reassembly in Response to Salt Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Regulation of cortical microtubule reorganization is essential for plant cell survival under high salinity conditions. In response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress, microtubules undergo rapid depolymerization followed by reassembly to form a new microtubule network that promotes cell survival; however, the upstream regulatory mechanisms for this recovery response are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that ethylene signaling facilitates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress-induced reassembly of cortical microtubules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Microtubule depolymerization was not affected under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress following the suppression of ethylene signaling with Ag<sup>+</sup> or in ethylene-insensitive mutants, whereas microtubule reassembly was significantly inhibited. ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3, a key transcription factor in the ethylene signaling pathway, was shown to play a central role in microtubule reassembly under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress. In addition, we performed functional characterization of the microtubule-stabilizing protein WAVE-DAMPENED2-LIKE5 (WDL5), which was found to promote ethylene-associated microtubule reassembly and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress tolerance. These findings indicate that ethylene signaling regulates microtubule reassembly by up-regulating <i>WDL5</i> expression in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress, thereby implicating ethylene signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong>-stress tolerance in plants.</p>

The Distinct Roles of Class I and II RPD3-Like Histone Deacetylases in Salinity Stress Response
<p>Histone acetylation is an essential process in the epigenetic regulation of diverse biological processes, including environmental stress responses in plants. Previously, our research group identified a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (HDI) that confers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In this study, we demonstrate that class I HDAC (HDA19) and class II HDACs (HDA5/14/15/18) control responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress through different pathways. The screening of 12 different selective HDIs indicated that seven newly reported HDIs enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance. Genetic analysis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on a pharmacological study, identified which HDACs function in salinity stress tolerance. In the wild-type Columbia-0 background, <i>hda19</i> plants exhibit tolerance to high-salinity stress, while <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants exhibit hypersensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the effect of <i>HDA19</i> deficiency on the response to salinity stress is distinct from that of <i>HDA5/14/15/18</i> deficiencies. In <i>hda19</i> plants, the expression levels of stress tolerance-related genes, late embryogenesis abundant proteins that prevent protein aggregation and positive regulators such as ABI5 and NAC019 in abscisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> signaling, were induced strongly relative to the wild type. Neither of these elements was up-regulated in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants. The mutagenesis of HDA19 by genome editing in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance, suggesting that suppression of HDA19 masks the phenotype caused by the suppression of class II HDACs in the salinity stress response. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HDIs that inhibit class I HDACs allow the rescue of plants from salinity stress regardless of their selectivity, and they provide insight into the hierarchal regulation of environmental stress responses through HDAC isoforms.</p>

A Central Role for Triacylglycerol in Membrane Lipid Breakdown, Fatty Acid <i>β</i>-Oxidation, and Plant Survival under Extended Darkness
<p>Neutral lipid metabolism is a key aspect of intracellular homeostasis and energy balance and plays a vital role in cell survival under adverse conditions, including nutrient deprivation in yeast and mammals, but the role of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in plant stress response remains largely unknown. By thoroughly characterizing mutants defective in SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 (SDP1) triacylglycerol lipase or PEROXISOMAL ABC TRANSPORTER 1 (PXA1), here we show that TAG is a key intermediate in the mobilization of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s from membrane lipids for peroxisomal β-oxidation under prolonged dark treatment. Disruption of SDP1 increased TAG accumulation in cytosolic lipid droplets and markedly enhanced plant tolerance to extended darkness. We demonstrate that blocking TAG hydrolysis enhances plant tolerance to dark treatment via two distinct mechanisms. In <i>pxa1</i> mutants, in which free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s accumulated rapidly under extended darkness, SDP1 disruption resulted in a marked decrease in levels of cytotoxic lipid intermediates such as free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and phosphatidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, suggesting a buffer function of TAG accumulation against lipotoxicity under fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> overload. In the wild type, in which free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s remained low and unchanged under dark treatment, disruption of SDP1 caused a decrease in reactive oxygen species production and hence the level of lipid peroxidation, indicating a role of TAG in protection against oxidative damage. Overall, our findings reveal a crucial role for TAG metabolism in membrane lipid breakdown, fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover, and plant survival under extended darkness.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

A Virus-Induced Assay for Functional Dissection and Analysis of Monocot and Dicot Flowering Time Genes
<p>Virus-induced flowering (VIF) uses virus vectors to express <i>Flowering Locus T</i> (<i>FT</i>) to induce flowering in plants. This approach has recently attracted wide interest for its practical applications in accelerating breeding in crops and woody fruit trees. However, the insight into VIF and its potential as a powerful tool for dissecting florigenic proteins remained to be elucidated. Here, we describe the mechanism and further applications of <i>Potato virus X</i> (PVX)-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF in the short-day <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> cultivar Maryland Mammoth. Ectopic delivery of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtFT</i> by PVX/AtFT did not induce the expression of the endogenous <i>FT</i> ortholog <i>NtFT4</i>; however, it was sufficient to trigger flowering in Maryland Mammoth plants grown under noninductive long-day conditions. Infected tobacco plants developed no systemic symptoms, and the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF did not cause transgenerational flowering. We showed that the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF is a much more rapid method to examine the impacts of single amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> mutations on AtFT for floral induction than making individual transgenic Arabidopsis lines for each mutation. We also used the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF to demonstrate that adding a His- or FLAG-tag to the N or C terminus of AtFT could affect its florigenic activity and that this system can be applied to assay the function of <i>FT</i> genes from heterologous species, including tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>SFT</i> and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>Hd3a</i>. Thus, the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF represents a simple and efficient system to identify individual amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s that are essential for FT-mediated floral induction and to test the ability of mono- and dicotyledonous <i>FT</i> genes and FT fusion proteins to induce flowering.</p>

Bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino acids suppress sinonasal innate immunity through sweet taste receptors in solitary chemosensory cells
<p>In the upper respiratory epithelium, bitter and sweet taste receptors present in solitary chemosensory cells influence antimicrobial innate immune defense responses. Whereas activation of bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) stimulates surrounding epithelial cells to release antimicrobial peptides, activation of the sweet taste receptor (T1R) in the same cells inhibits this response. This mechanism is thought to control the magnitude of antimicrobial peptide release <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on the sugar content of airway surface liquid. We hypothesized that <sc>d</sc>-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, which are produced by various bacteria and activate T1R in taste receptor cells in the mouth, may also activate T1R in the airway. We showed that both the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits of the sweet taste receptor (T1R2/3) were present in the same chemosensory cells of primary human sinonasal epithelial cultures. Respiratory isolates of <i>Staphylococcus</i> species, but not <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, produced at least two <sc>d</sc>-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s that activate the sweet taste receptor. In addition to inhibiting <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation, <sc>d</sc>-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s derived from <i>Staphylococcus</i> inhibited T2R-mediated signaling and defensin secretion in sinonasal cells by activating T1R2/3. <sc>d</sc>-Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>–mediated activation of T1R2/3 also enhanced epithelial cell death during challenge with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in the presence of the bitter receptor–activating compound denatonium benzoate.

Activation of master virulence regulator PhoP in acidic pH requires the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic conditions, such as those inside phagosomes, stimulate the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to activate virulence genes. The sensor PhoQ responds to a mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH by phosphorylating, and thereby activating, the virulence regulator PhoP. This PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is conserved in a subset of Gram-negative bacteria. PhoQ is thought to be sufficient to activate PhoP in mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH. However, we found that the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL, which was horizontally acquired by <i>Salmonella</i> before the divergence of <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>Salmonella bongori</i>, was also necessary for PhoQ to activate PhoP under mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH conditions but not for PhoQ to activate PhoP in response to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> or the antimicrobial peptide C18G. UgtL increased the abundance of phosphorylated PhoP by stimulating autophosphorylation of PhoQ, thereby increasing the amount of the phosphodonor for PhoP. Deletion of <i>ugtL</i> attenuated <i>Salmonella</i> virulence and further reduced PhoP activation in a strain bearing a form of PhoQ that is not responsive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH. These data suggest that when <i>Salmonella</i> experiences mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH, PhoP activation requires PhoQ to detect pH and UgtL to amplify the PhoQ response. Our findings reveal how acquisition of a foreign gene can strengthen signal responsiveness in an ancestral regulatory system.</p>

A Critical Role of Sodium Flux via the Plasma Membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Exchanger SOS1 in the Salt Tolerance of Rice
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) stands among the world's most important crop species. Rice is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> sensitive, and the undue accumulation of sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) in shoots has the strongest negative correlation with rice productivity under long-term salinity. The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> Overly Sensitive 1 (SOS1) is the sole Na<sup>+</sup> efflux transporter that has been genetically characterized to date. Here, the importance of SOS1-facilitated Na<sup>+</sup> flux in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance of rice was analyzed in a reverse-genetics approach. A <i>sos1</i> loss-of-function mutant displayed exceptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> sensitivity that was correlated with excessive Na<sup>+</sup> intake and impaired Na<sup>+</sup> loading into the xylem, thus indicating that SOS1 controls net root Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and long-distance Na<sup>+</sup> transport to shoots. The acute Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of <i>sos1</i> plants at low NaCl concentrations allowed analysis of the transcriptional response to sodicity stress without effects of the osmotic stress intrinsic to high-salinity treatments. In contrast with that in the wild type, <i>sos1</i> mutant roots displayed preferential down-regulation of stress-related genes in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> treatment, despite the greater intensity of stress experienced by the mutant. These results suggest there is impaired stress detection or an inability to mount a comprehensive response to salinity in <i>sos1</i>. In summary, the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger SOS1 plays a major role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance of rice by controlling Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and possibly contributing to the sensing of sodicity stress.</p>

Chloroplast Damage Induced by the Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthesis Triggers Autophagy in Chlamydomonas
<p>Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are synthesized in the stroma of plant and algal chloroplasts by the fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase complex. Newly synthesized fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are then used to generate plastidial lipids that are essential for chloroplast structure and function. Here, we show that inhibition of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> activates autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic process by which cells degrade intracellular material under adverse conditions to maintain cell homeostasis. Treatment of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells with cerulenin, a specific fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase inhibitor, stimulated lipidation of the autophagosome protein ATG8 and enhanced autophagic flux. We found that inhibition of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis decreased monogalactosyldiacylglycerol abundance, increased lutein content, down-regulated photosynthesis, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species. Electron microscopy revealed a high degree of thylakoid membrane stacking in cerulenin-treated cells. Moreover, global transcriptomic analysis of these cells showed an up-regulation of genes encoding chloroplast proteins involved in protein folding and oxidative stress and the induction of major catabolic processes, including autophagy and proteasome pathways. Thus, our results uncovered a link between lipid metabolism, chloroplast integrity, and autophagy through a mechanism that involves the activation of a chloroplast quality control system.</p>

The reaction mechanism of DCA synthase characterized herein partly shares a similarity with those of cannabinoid synthases from <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, whereas DCA synthase catalyzes a novel cyclization reaction of the farnesyl moiety of a meroterpenoid natural product of plant origin. Moreover, in this study, we present evidence that DCA is biosynthesized and accumulated specifically in the glandular scales, on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on various analytical studies at the chemical, biochemical, and molecular levels. The extracellular localization of DCA also was confirmed by a confocal microscopic analysis of its autofluorescence. These data highlight the unique feature of DCA: the final step of biosynthesis is completed in apoplastic space, and it is highly accumulated outside the scale cells.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d Plant Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

A Magnesium Transporter OsMGT1 Plays a Critical Role in Salt Tolerance in Rice
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress is one of the major factors limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production globally. Although several transporters involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance have been identified in rice, the mechanisms regulating their transport activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg transporter OsMGT1 is required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> tolerance probably by regulating transport activity of OsHKT1;5, a key transporter for the removal of Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem sap at the root mature zone. Knockout of <i>OsMGT1</i> did not affect total Na uptake, but increased Na concentration in the shoots and xylem sap, resulting in a significant increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> sensitivity at low external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (20–200 μ<sc>m</sc>). However, such differences were abolished at a higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (2 m<sc>m</sc>), although the total Na uptake was not altered. <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in both the roots and shoots, but only that in the roots was moderately up-regulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress. Spatial expression analysis revealed that <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in all root cells of the root tips but was highly expressed in the pericycle of root mature zone. <i>OsMGT1</i> was also expressed in the phloem region of basal node, leaf blade, and sheath. When expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, the transport activity of OsHKT1;5 was enhanced by elevating external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Furthermore, knockout of <i>OsHKT1;5</i> in <i>osmgt1</i> mutant background did not further increase its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that Mg<sup>2+</sup> transported by OsMGT1 in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots.</p>

A Palmitic Acid Elongase Affects Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Plastidial Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Levels in Nannochloropsis
<p><i>Nannochloropsis</i> species are oleaginous eukaryotes containing a plastid limited by four membranes, deriving from a secondary endosymbiosis. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, thylakoid lipids, including monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s (FAs) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The production of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown process. We identified seven elongases and five desaturases possibly involved in EPA production in <i>Nannochloropsis gaditana</i>. Among the six heterokont-specific saturated FA elongases possibly acting upstream in this pathway, we characterized the highly expressed isoform <i>Δ0-ELO1</i>. Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) showed that NgΔ0-ELO1 could elongate palmitic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> Δ0-elo1 mutants exhibited a reduced EPA level and a specific decrease in MGDG. In NgΔ0-elo1 lines, the impairment of photosynthesis is consistent with a role of EPA-rich MGDG in nonphotochemical quenching control, possibly providing an appropriate MGDG platform for the xanthophyll cycle. Concomitantly with MGDG decrease, the level of triacylglycerol (TAG) containing medium chain FAs increased. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, part of EPA used for MGDG production is therefore biosynthesized by a channeled process initiated at the elongation step of palmitic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> by Δ0-ELO1, thus acting as a committing enzyme for galactolipid production. Based on the MGDG/TAG balance controlled by Δ0-ELO1, this study also provides novel prospects for the engineering of oleaginous microalgae for biotechnological applications.</p>

SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 Aides in Resilience to Salt and Drought in Freezing-Sensitive Tomato
<p>SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 (SFR2) is crucial for protecting chloroplast membranes following freezing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). It has been shown that SFR2 homologs are present in all land plants, including freezing-sensitive species, raising the question of SFR2 function beyond freezing tolerance. Similar to freezing, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> and drought can cause dehydration. Thus, it is hypothesized that in freezing-sensitive plants SFR2 may play roles in their resilience to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> or drought. To test this hypothesis, <i>SlSFR2</i> RNAi lines were generated in the cold/freezing-sensitive species tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> [M82 <i>cv</i>]). Hypersensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> and drought of <i>SlSFR2</i>-RNAi lines was observed. Higher tolerance of wild-type tomatoes was correlated with the production of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol, a product of SFR2 activity. Tomato SFR2 in vitro activity is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and its optimal pH is 7.5, similar to that of Arabidopsis SFR2, but the specific activity of tomato SFR2 in vitro is almost double that of Arabidopsis SFR2. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> and drought stress were applied to Arabidopsis, no conditions could be identified at which SFR2 was induced prior to irreversibly impacting plant growth, suggesting that SFR2 protects Arabidopsis primarily against freezing. Discovery of tomato SFR2 function in drought and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> resilience provides further insights into general membrane lipid remodeling-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d stress tolerance mechanisms and together with protection against freezing in freezing-resistant plants such as Arabidopsis, it adds lipid remodeling as a possible target for the engineering of abiotic stress-resilient crops.</p>

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements

Identification of Genes Encoding Enzymes Catalyzing the Early Steps of Carrot Polyacetylene Biosynthesis
<p>Polyacetylenic lipids accumulate in various Apiaceae species after pathogen attack, suggesting that these compounds are naturally occurring pesticides and potentially valuable resources for crop improvement. These compounds also promote human health and slow tumor growth. Even though polyacetylenic lipids were discovered decades ago, the biosynthetic pathway underlying their production is largely unknown. To begin filling this gap and ultimately enable polyacetylene engineering, we studied polyacetylenes and their biosynthesis in the major Apiaceae crop carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i> subsp. <i>sativus</i>). Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified three known polyacetylenes and assigned provisional structures to two novel polyacetylenes. We also quantified these compounds in carrot leaf, petiole, root xylem, root phloem, and root periderm extracts. Falcarindiol and falcarinol predominated and accumulated primarily in the root periderm. Since the multiple double and triple carbon-carbon bonds that distinguish polyacetylenes from ubiquitous fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are often introduced by Δ12 oleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> desaturase (FAD2)-type enzymes, we mined the carrot genome for <i>FAD2</i> genes. We identified a <i>FAD2</i> family with an unprecedented 24 members and analyzed public, tissue-specific carrot RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed members with root periderm-enhanced expression. Six candidate genes were heterologously expressed individually and in combination in yeast and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), resulting in the identification of one canonical FAD2 that converts oleic to linoleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, three divergent FAD2-like acetylenases that convert linoleic into crepenynic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and two bifunctional FAD2s with Δ12 and Δ14 desaturase activity that convert crepenynic into the further desaturated dehydrocrepenynic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, a polyacetylene pathway intermediate. These genes can now be used as a basis for discovering other steps of falcarin-type polyacetylene biosynthesis, to modulate polyacetylene levels in plants, and to test the in planta function of these molecules.</p>

Nodulin Intrinsic Protein 7;1 Is a Tapetal Boric Acid Channel Involved in Pollen Cell Wall Formation
<p>Boron is an essential plant micronutrient that plays a structural role in the rhamnogalacturonan II component of the pectic cell wall. To prevent boron deficiency under limiting conditions, its uptake, distribution, and homeostasis are mediated by boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transporters and channel proteins. Among the membrane channels that facilitate boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> uptake are the type II nodulin intrinsic protein (NIP) subfamily of aquaporin-like proteins. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses three NIP II genes (<i>NIP5;1</i>, <i>NIP6;1</i>, and <i>NIP7;1</i>) that show distinct tissue expression profiles (predominantly expressed in roots, stem nodes, and developing flowers, respectively). Orthologs of each are represented in all dicots. Here, we show that purified and reconstituted NIP7;1 is a boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> facilitator. By using native promoter-reporter fusions, we show that NIP7;1 is expressed predominantly in anthers of young flowers in a narrow developmental window, floral stages 9 and 10, with protein accumulation solely within tapetum cells, where it is localized to the plasma membrane. Under limiting boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> conditions, loss-of-function T-DNA mutants (<i>nip7;1-1</i> and <i>nip7;1-2</i>) show reduced fertility, including shorter siliques and an increase in aborted seeds, compared with the wild type. Under these conditions, <i>nip7;1</i> mutant pollen grains show morphological defects, increased aggregation, defective exine cell wall formation, reduced germination frequency, and decreased viability. During stages 9 and 10, the tapetum is essential for supplying materials to the pollen microspore cell wall. We propose that NIP7;1 serves as a gated boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> channel in developing anthers that aids in the uptake of this critical micronutrient by tapetal cells.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction

However, the construction of accurate 3D plant models is challenging, as plants are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all plants, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target plant, tuning camera placement to match the plant’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic plant modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d plant reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different plant structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of plant types.</p>

Screening for Biologically Annotated Drugs That Trigger Triacylglycerol Accumulation in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i>
<p>Microalgae are a promising feedstock for the production of triacylglycerol (TAG) for a variety of potential applications, ranging from food and human health to biofuels and green chemistry. However, obtaining high TAG yields is challenging. A phenotypic assay for the accumulation of oil droplets was developed to screen a library of 1,200 drugs, annotated with pharmacology information, to select compounds that trigger TAG accumulation in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Using this screen, we identified 34 molecules acting in a dose-dependent manner. Previously characterized targets of these compounds include cell division and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five compounds possibly acting on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen that is used in contraceptive pills and known for its ecological impact as an endocrine disruptor. Ethynylestradiol impaired the production of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, destabilized the galactolipid versus phospholipid balance, and triggered the recycling of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s from membrane lipids to TAG. The <i>P. tricornutum</i> transcriptomic response to treatment with ethynylestradiol was consistent with the reallocation of carbon from sterols to acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of action and catabolism of ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regulated cytochrome P450 proteins. A fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> elongase, Δ6-ELO-B1, might be involved in the impairment of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover. This phenotypic screen opens new perspectives for the exploration of novel bioactive molecules, potential target genes, and pathways controlling TAG biosynthesis. It also unraveled the sensitivity of diatoms to endocrine disruptors, highlighting an impact of anthropogenic pollution on phytoplankton.</p>

Biotin Attachment Domain-Containing Proteins Irreversibly Inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
<p>The first committed step in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis is mediated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), a biotin-dependent enzyme that carboxylates acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-term or long-term exposure to fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly containing oleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>), which results in reversible or irreversible ACCase inhibition, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin carboxyl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporation into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-containing) biotin carboxyltransferase protein subunits. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines containing T-DNA insertions in <i>BADC1</i>, <i>BADC2</i>, and <i>BADC3</i> were used to generate <i>badc1 badc2</i> and <i>badc1 badc3</i> double mutants. The <i>badc1 badc3</i> mutant exhibited normal growth and development; however, ACCase activity was 26% higher in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and its seeds contained 30.1% more fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and 32.6% more triacylgycerol relative to wild-type plants. To assess whether BADC contributes to the irreversible phase of ACCase inhibition, cell suspension cultures were generated from the leaves of <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type plants and treated with 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tween 80. Reversible ACCase inhibition was similar in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type cultures after 2 d of Tween 80 treatment, but irreversible inhibition was reduced by 50% in <i>badc1 badc3</i> relative to wild-type plants following 4 d of Tween 80 treatment. In this study, we present evidence for two important homeostatic roles for BADC proteins in down-regulating ACCase activity: by acting during normal growth and development and by contributing to its long-term irreversible feedback inhibition resulting from the oversupply of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Isoforms Are Differentially Activated by Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Intermediates
<p>The cyanide-insensitive alternative oxidase (AOX) is a non-proton-pumping ubiquinol oxidase that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water and is posttranslationally regulated by redox mechanisms and 2-oxo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses five AOX isoforms (AOX1A–AOX1D and AOX2). AOX1D expression is increased in <i>aox1a</i> knockout mutants from Arabidopsis (especially after restriction of the cytochrome <i>c</i> pathway) but cannot compensate for the lack of AOX1A, suggesting a difference in the regulation of these isoforms. Therefore, we analyzed the different AOX isoenzymes with the aim to identify differences in their posttranslational regulation. Seven tricarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> cycle intermediates (citrate, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate) were tested for their influence on AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D wild-type protein activity using a refined in vitro system. AOX1C is insensitive to all seven organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, AOX1A and AOX1D are both activated by 2-oxoglutarate, but only AOX1A is additionally activated by oxaloacetate. Furthermore, AOX isoforms cannot be transformed to mimic one another by substituting the variable cysteine residues at position III in the protein. In summary, we show that AOX isoforms from Arabidopsis are differentially fine-regulated by tricarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> cycle metabolites (most likely depending on the amino-terminal region around the highly conserved cysteine residues known to be involved in regulation by the 2-oxo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s pyruvate and glyoxylate) and propose that this is the main reason why they cannot functionally compensate for each other.</p>

Selinene Volatiles Are Essential Precursors for Maize Defense Promoting Fungal Pathogen Resistance
<p>To ensure food security, maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a model crop for understanding useful traits underlying stress resistance. In contrast to foliar biochemicals, root defenses limiting the spread of disease remain poorly described. To better understand belowground defenses in the field, we performed root metabolomic profiling and uncovered unexpectedly high levels of the sesquiterpene volatile β-selinene and the corresponding nonvolatile antibiotic derivative β-costic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. The application of metabolite-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d quantitative trait locus mapping using biparental populations, genome-wide association studies, and near-isogenic lines enabled the identification of terpene synthase21 (<i>ZmTps21</i>) on chromosome 9 as a β-costic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pathway candidate gene. Numerous closely examined β-costic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>-deficient inbred lines were found to harbor <i>Zmtps21</i> pseudogenes lacking conserved motifs required for farnesyl diphosphate cyclase activity. For biochemical validation, a full-length <i>ZmTps21</i> was cloned, heterologously expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and demonstrated to cyclize farnesyl diphosphate, yielding β-selinene as the dominant product. Consistent with microbial defense pathways, <i>ZmTps21</i> transcripts strongly accumulate following fungal elicitation. Challenged field roots containing functional <i>ZmTps21</i> alleles displayed β-costic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels over 100 μg g<sup>−1</sup> fresh weight, greatly exceeding in vitro concentrations required to inhibit the growth of five different fungal pathogens and rootworm larvae (<i>Diabrotica balteata</i>). In vivo disease resistance assays, using <i>ZmTps21</i> and <i>Zmtps21</i> near-isogenic lines, further support the endogenous antifungal role of selinene-derived metabolites. Involved in the biosynthesis of nonvolatile antibiotics, <i>ZmTps21</i> exists as a useful gene for germplasm improvement programs targeting optimized biotic stress resistance.</p>

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1
<p>In the search for renewable energy sources, genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve plant cell wall composition for biofuel and bioproducts generation. Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to engineer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>olysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 coupling of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde coupling products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively coupled into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar platform industry.</p>

<i>S5H/DMR6</i> Encodes a Salicylic Acid 5-Hydroxylase That Fine-Tunes Salicylic Acid Homeostasis
<p>The phytohormone salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (SA) plays essential roles in biotic and abiotic responses, plant development, and leaf senescence. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (2,5-DHBA or gentisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>) is one of the most commonly occurring aromatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in green plants and is assumed to be generated from SA, but the enzymes involved in its production remain obscure. DMR6 (Downy Mildew Resistant6; At5g24530) has been proven essential in plant immunity of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but its biochemical properties are not well understood. Here, we report the discovery and functional characterization of DMR6 as a salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> 5-hydroxylase (S5H) that catalyzes the formation of 2,5-DHBA by hydroxylating SA at the C5 position of its phenyl ring in Arabidopsis. S5H/DMR6 specifically converts SA to 2,5-DHBA in vitro and displays higher catalytic efficiency (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 4.96 × 10<sup>4</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) than the previously reported S3H (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 6.09 × 10<sup>3</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) for SA. Interestingly, S5H/DMR6 displays a substrate inhibition property that may enable automatic control of its enzyme activities. The <i>s5h</i> mutant and <i>s5hs3h</i> double mutant overaccumulate SA and display phenotypes such as a smaller growth size, early senescence, and a loss of susceptibility to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. <i>S5H</i>/<i>DMR6</i> is sensitively induced by SA/pathogen treatment and is expressed widely from young seedlings to senescing plants, whereas <i>S3H</i> is more specifically expressed at the mature and senescing stages. Collectively, our results disclose the identity of the enzyme required for 2,5-DHBA formation and reveal a mechanism by which plants fine-tune SA homeostasis by mediating SA 5-hydroxylation.</p>

A Nucleus-Localized Long Non-Coding RNA Enhances Drought and Salt Stress Tolerance
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene expression through a wide range of mechanisms and are considered as important regulators in many essential biological processes. A large number of lncRNA transcripts have been predicted or identified in plants in recent years. However, the biological functions for most of them are still unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lncRNA, <i>DROUGHT INDUCED lncRNA</i> (<i>DRIR</i>), as a novel positive regulator of the plant response to drought and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress. <i>DRIR</i> was expressed at a low level under nonstress conditions but can be significantly activated by drought and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress as well as by abscisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (ABA) treatment. We identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i>, which had higher expression of the <i>DRIR</i> gene than the wild-type plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant exhibits increased tolerance to drought and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress. Overexpressing <i>DRIR</i> in Arabidopsis also increased tolerance to drought and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salt</span></strong> stress of the transgenic plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant and the overexpressing seedlings are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in stomata closure and seedling growth. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the expression of a large number of genes was altered in <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> and the overexpressing plants. These include genes involved in ABA signaling, water transport, and other stress-relief processes. Our study reveals a mechanism whereby <i>DRIR</i> regulates the plant response to abiotic stress by modulating the expression of a series of genes involved in the stress response.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support respiration. Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark respiration. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of respiration and amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s used as alternative substrates to the respiration.</p>

An R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor Regulates Capsaicinoid Biosynthesis
<p>Capsaicinoids are responsible for the hot taste of chili peppers. They are restricted to the genus <i>Capsicum</i> and are synthesized by the acylation of the aromatic compound vanillylamine (derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway) with a branched-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> by the catalysis of the putative enzyme capsaicinoid synthase. R2R3-MYB transcription factors have been reported in different species of plants as regulators of structural genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway; therefore, we hypothesized that MYB genes might be involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis of pungent compounds. In this study, an <i>R2R3-MYB</i> transcription factor gene, designated <i>CaMYB31</i>, was isolated and characterized in <i>Capsicum annuum</i> ‘Tampiqueíííéóéííóéíño 74’. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that <i>CaMYB31</i> could be involved in secondary metabolism, stress and plant hormone responses, and development. <i>CaMYB31</i> expression analysis from placental tissue of pungent and nonpungent chili pepper fruits showed a positive correlation with the structural genes <i>Ca4H</i>, <i>Comt</i>, <i>Kas</i>, <i>pAmt</i>, and <i>AT3</i> expression and also with the content of capsaicin and dihydrocapsacin during fruit development. However, <i>CaMYB31</i> also was expressed in vegetative tissues (leaves, roots, and stems). Moreover, <i>CaMYB31</i> silencing significantly reduced the expression of capsaicinoid biosynthetic genes and the capsaicinoid content. Additionally, <i>CaMYB31</i> expression was affected by the plant hormones indoleacetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and gibberellic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> or by wounding, temperature, and light, factors known to affect the production of capsaicinoids. These findings indicate that <i>CaMYB31</i> is indeed involved in the regulation of structural genes of the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway.</p>

A Specialized Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase Contributes to the Extreme Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Content of <i>Cuphea</i> Seed Oil
<p>Seed oils of many <i>Cuphea</i> sp. contain >90% of medium-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, such as decanoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (10:0). These seed oils, which are among the most compositionally variant in the plant kingdom, arise from specialized fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> biosynthetic enzymes and specialized acyltransferases. These include lysophosphatidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylation of medium-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in the <i>sn</i>-2 and <i>sn</i>-3 positions of seed triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identification of a cDNA for a DGAT1-type enzyme, designated CpuDGAT1, from the transcriptome of <i>C. avigera</i> var <i>pulcherrima</i> developing seeds. Microsomes of camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>) seeds engineered for CpuDGAT1 expression displayed DGAT activity with 10:0-CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4-fold higher than that in camelina seed microsomes lacking CpuDGAT1. In addition, coexpression in camelina seeds of CpuDGAT1 with a <i>C. viscosissima</i> FatB thioesterase (CvFatB1) that generates 10:0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10:0. More strikingly, expression of CpuDGAT1 and CvFatB1 with the previously described CvLPAT2, a 10:0-CoA-specific <i>Cuphea</i> LPAT, increased 10:0 amounts to 25 mol % in camelina seed TAG. These TAGs contained up to 40 mol % 10:0 in the <i>sn</i>-2 position, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpression of CvFatB1 and CvLPAT2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10:0 was not detected in phosphatidylcholine in these seeds. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10:0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these enzymes to generate 10:0-rich seed oils.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity
<p>During winter, trees have to cope with harsh conditions, including extreme freeze-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell damage and was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on in situ monitoring of xylem (thermocouples) and surface temperatures (infrared imaging), ultrasonic emissions, and dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct freezing patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>, and (3) from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of freezing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon freezing, were both related to minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit and soil temperature. These complex patterns, emphasizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter tree physiology.</p>

A tailless aerial robotic flapper reveals that flies use torque coupling in rapid banked turns
<p>Insects are among the most agile natural flyers. Hypotheses on their flight control cannot always be validated by experiments with animals or tethered robots. To this end, we developed a programmable and agile autonomous free-flying robot controlled through bio-inspired motion changes of its flapping wings. Despite being 55 times the size of a fruit fly, the robot can accurately mimic the rapid escape maneuvers of flies, including a correcting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yaw</span></strong> rotation toward the escape heading. Because the robot’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yaw</span></strong> control was turned off, we showed that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yaw</span></strong> rotations result from passive, translation-induced aerodynamic coupling between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yaw</span></strong> torque and the roll and pitch torques produced throughout the maneuver. The robot enables new methods for studying animal flight, and its flight characteristics allow for real-world flight missions.</p>

Role of outstretched forelegs of flying beetles revealed and demonstrated by remote leg stimulation in free flight
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The forelegs of beetles were found to voluntarily swing to assist with flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yaw</span></strong> rotation. Remote control of left–right turnings by inducing leg swings was demonstrated via a wireless electrical stimulator.</p>

Three-dimensional movements of the pectoral fin during yaw turns in the Pacific spiny dogfish, <i>Squalus suckleyi</i>
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Pacific spiny dogfish rotate the inside pectoral fin consistently about three axes during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yaw</span></strong> turning, which correlates with turning performance. Stimulation experiments confirm hypotheses about muscle function in controlling actuation.</p>

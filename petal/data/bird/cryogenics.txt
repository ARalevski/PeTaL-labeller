Highly efficient electrocaloric cooling with electrostatic actuation
<p>Solid-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">refriger</span></strong>ation offers potential advantages over traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing systems, but few devices offer high specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing power with a high coefficient of performance (COP) and the ability to be applied directly to surfaces. We developed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing device with a high intrinsic thermodynamic efficiency using a flexible electrocaloric (EC) polymer film and an electrostatic actuation mechanism. Reversible electrostatic forces reduce parasitic power consumption and allow efficient heat transfer through good thermal contacts with the heat source or heat sink. The EC device produced a specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing power of 2.8 watts per gram and a COP of 13. The new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing device is more efficient and compact than existing surface-conformable solid-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing technologies, opening a path to using the technology for a variety of practical applications.</p>

Rapid change of superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling through critical doping in Bi-2212
<p>Electron-boson coupling plays a key role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity for many systems. However, in copper-based high–critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ors, its relation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity remains controversial despite strong spectroscopic fingerprints. In this study, we used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to find a pronounced correlation between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing gap and the bosonic coupling strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+δ</sub>. The bosonic coupling strength rapidly increases from the overdoped Fermi liquid regime to the optimally doped strange metal, concomitant with the quadrupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing gap and the doubled gap-to-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ratio across the pseudogap boundary. This synchronized lattice and electronic response suggests that the effects of electronic interaction and the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) reinforce each other in a positive-feedback loop upon entering the strange-metal regime, which in turn drives a stronger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity.</p>

Strongly correlated quantum walks with a 12-qubit superconducting processor
<p>Quantum walks are the quantum analogs of classical random walks, which allow for the simulation of large-scale quantum many-body systems and the realization of universal quantum computation without time-dependent control. We experimentally demonstrate quantum walks of one and two strongly correlated microwave photons in a one-dimensional array of 12 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits with short-range interactions. First, in one-photon quantum walks, we observed the propagation of the density and correlation of the quasiparticle excitation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubit and quantum entanglement between qubit pairs. Second, when implementing two-photon quantum walks by exciting two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits, we observed the fermionization of strongly interacting photons from the measured time-dependent long-range anticorrelations, representing the antibunching of photons with attractive interactions. The demonstration of quantum walks on a quantum processor, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits as artificial atoms and tomographic readout, paves the way to quantum simulation of many-body phenomena and universal quantum computation.</p>

Phonon-mediated quantum state transfer and remote qubit entanglement
<p>Phonons, and in particular surface acoustic wave phonons, have been proposed as a means to coherently couple distant solid-state quantum systems. Individual phonons in a resonant structure can be controlled and detected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits, enabling the coherent generation and measurement of complex stationary phonon states. We report the deterministic emission and capture of itinerant surface acoustic wave phonons, enabling the quantum entanglement of two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits. Using a 2-millimeter-long acoustic quantum communication channel, equivalent to a 500-nanosecond delay line, we demonstrate the emission and recapture of a phonon by one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubit, quantum state transfer between two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits with a 67% efficiency, and, by partial transfer of a phonon, generation of an entangled Bell pair with a fidelity of 84%.</p>

Structural basis of cooling agent and lipid sensing by the cold-activated TRPM8 channel
<p>Transient receptor potential melastatin member 8 (TRPM8) is a calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)–permeable cation channel that serves as the primary cold and menthol sensor in humans. Activation of TRPM8 by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing compounds relies on allosteric actions of agonist and membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), but lack of structural information has thus far precluded a mechanistic understanding of ligand and lipid sensing by TRPM8. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structures of TRPM8 in complex with the synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing compound icilin, PIP<sub>2</sub>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as well as in complex with the menthol analog WS-12 and PIP<sub>2</sub>. Our structures reveal the binding sites for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing agonists and PIP<sub>2</sub> in TRPM8. Notably, PIP<sub>2</sub> binds to TRPM8 in two different modes, which illustrate the mechanism of allosteric coupling between PIP<sub>2</sub> and agonists. This study provides a platform for understanding the molecular mechanism of TRPM8 activation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing agents.</p>

Electrically tunable low-density superconductivity in a monolayer topological insulator

Hierarchically porous polymer coatings for highly efficient passive daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive daytime radiative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing (PDRC) involves spontaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing a surface by reflecting sunlight and radiating heat to the cold outer space. Current PDRC designs are promising alternatives to electrical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing but are either inefficient or have limited applicability. We present a simple, inexpensive, and scalable phase inversion–based method for fabricating hierarchically porous poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) [P(VdF-HFP)<sub>HP</sub>] coatings with excellent PDRC capability. High, substrate-independent hemispherical solar reflectances (0.96 ± 0.03) and long-wave infrared emittances (0.97 ± 0.02) allow for subambient temperature drops of ~6°C and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing powers of ~96 watts per square meter (W m<sup>−2</sup>) under solar intensities of 890 and 750 W m<sup>−2</sup>, respectively. The performance equals or surpasses those of state-of-the-art PDRC designs, and the technique offers a paint-like simplicity.</p>

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor
<p>The anomalous metallic state in the high-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing cuprates is masked by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity near a quantum critical point. Applying high magnetic fields to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity has enabled detailed studies of the normal state, yet the direct effect of strong magnetic fields on the metallic state is poorly understood. We report the high-field magnetoresistance of thin-film La<sub>2–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>Sr<i><sub>x</sub></i>CuO<sub>4</sub> cuprate in the vicinity of the critical doping, 0.161 ≤ <i>p</i> ≤ 0.190. We find that the metallic state exposed by suppressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity is characterized by magnetoresistance that is linear in magnetic fields up to 80 tesla. The magnitude of the linear-in-field resistivity mirrors the magnitude and doping evolution of the well-known linear-in-temperature resistivity that has been associated with quantum criticality in high-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ors.</p>

Creation of a Bose-condensed gas of <sup>87</sup>Rb by laser cooling

We demonstrate direct laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing of a gas of rubidium-87 (<sup>87</sup>Rb) atoms to quantum degeneracy.

The atoms are trapped in a two-dimensional optical lattice that enables cycles of compression to increase the density, followed by Raman sideband <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing to decrease the temperature. From a starting number of 2000 atoms, 1400 atoms reach quantum degeneracy in 300 milliseconds, as confirmed by a bimodal velocity distribution.

Evidence for bulk superconductivity in pure bismuth single crystals at ambient pressure
<p>At ambient pressure, bulk rhombohedral bismuth is a semimetal that remains in the normal state down to at least 10 millikelvin. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in bulk bismuth is thought to be unlikely because of the extremely low carrier density.

Tuning superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene
<p>Materials with flat electronic bands often exhibit exotic quantum phenomena owing to strong correlations. An isolated low-energy flat band can be induced in bilayer graphene by simply rotating the layers by 1.1°, resulting in the appearance of gate-tunable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing and correlated insulating phases. In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to the twist angle, the interlayer coupling can be varied to precisely tune these phases. We induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity at a twist angle larger than 1.1°—in which correlated phases are otherwise absent—by varying the interlayer spacing with hydrostatic pressure. Our low-disorder devices reveal details about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing phase diagram and its relationship to the nearby insulator. Our results demonstrate twisted bilayer graphene to be a distinctively tunable platform for exploring correlated states.</p>

Aerosol-driven droplet concentrations dominate coverage and water of oceanic low-level clouds
<p>A lack of reliable estimates of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) aerosols over oceans has severely limited our ability to quantify their effects on cloud properties and extent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing by reflecting solar radiation—a key uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. We introduce a methodology for ascribing cloud properties to CCN and isolating the aerosol effects from meteorological effects. Its application showed that for a given meteorology, CCN explains three-fourths of the variability in the radiative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing effect of clouds, mainly through affecting shallow cloud cover and water path. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of cloud radiative forcing to CCN than previously reported, which means too much <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing if incorporated into present climate models. This suggests the existence of compensating aerosol warming effects yet to be discovered, possibly through deep clouds.</p>

Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma

The same optical forces also retard the plasma expansion, opening avenues for neutral-plasma confinement and manipulation.</p>

Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive radiative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing draws heat from surfaces and radiates it into space as infrared radiation to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared radiation flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime radiative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine.

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong> = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong> temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms

Probing optically silent superfluid stripes in cuprates
<p>Unconventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in the cuprates coexists with other types of electronic order. However, some of these orders are invisible to most experimental probes because of their symmetry. For example, the possible existence of superfluid stripes is not easily validated with linear optics, because the stripe alignment causes interlayer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing tunneling to vanish on average. Here we show that this frustration is removed in the nonlinear optical response.

Early spectra of the gravitational wave source GW170817: Evolution of a neutron star merger
<p>On 17 August 2017, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) was discovered as the optical counterpart of the binary neutron star gravitational wave event GW170817. We report time-series spectroscopy of SSS17a from 11.75 hours until 8.5 days after the merger. Over the first hour of observations, the ejecta rapidly expanded and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ed. Applying blackbody fits to the spectra, we measured the photosphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing from [Formula] to [Formula] kelvin, and determined a photospheric velocity of roughly 30% of the speed of light. The spectra of SSS17a began displaying broad features after 1.46 days and evolved qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) components. The late-time component is consistent with theoretical models of r-process–enriched neutron star ejecta, whereas the blue component requires high-velocity, lanthanide-free material.</p>

Femtosecond laser reshaping yields gold nanorods with ultranarrow surface plasmon resonances
<p>The irradiation of gold nanorod colloids with a femtosecond laser can be tuned to induce controlled nanorod reshaping, yielding colloids with exceptionally narrow localized surface plasmon resonance bands. The process relies on a regime characterized by a gentle multishot reduction of the aspect ratio, whereas the rod shape and volume are barely affected. Successful reshaping can only occur within a narrow window of the heat dissipation rate: Low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing rates lead to drastic morphological changes, and fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing has nearly no effect. Hence, a delicate balance must be achieved between irradiation fluence and surface density of the surfactant on the nanorods. This perfection process is appealing because it provides a simple, fast, reproducible, and scalable route toward gold nanorods with an optical response of exceptional quality, near the theoretical limit.</p>

Quantum acoustics with superconducting qubits
<p>Mechanical objects have important practical applications in the fields of quantum information and metrology as quantum memories or transducers for measuring and connecting different types of quantum systems. The field of electromechanics is in pursuit of a robust and highly coherent device that couples motion to nonlinear quantum objects such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a high-frequency bulk acoustic wave resonator that is strongly coupled to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubit using piezoelectric transduction with a cooperativity of 260. We measure qubit and mechanical coherence times on the order of 10 microseconds. Our device requires only simple fabrication methods and provides controllable access to a multitude of phonon modes. We demonstrate quantum control and measurement on gigahertz phonons at the single-quantum level.</p>

Discovery of orbital-selective Cooper pairing in FeSe
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>or iron selenide (FeSe) is of intense interest owing to its unusual nonmagnetic nematic state and potential for high-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity. But its Cooper pairing mechanism has not been determined. We used Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference imaging to determine the Fermi surface geometry of the electronic bands surrounding the Γ = (0, 0) and <i>X</i> = (π/<i>a</i><sub>Fe</sub>, 0) points of FeSe and to measure the corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing energy gaps. We show that both gaps are extremely anisotropic but nodeless and that they exhibit gap maxima oriented orthogonally in momentum space. Moreover, by implementing a novel technique, we demonstrate that these gaps have opposite sign with respect to each other. This complex gap configuration reveals the existence of orbital-selective Cooper pairing that, in FeSe, is based preferentially on electrons from the d<i><sub>yz</sub></i> orbitals of the iron atoms.</p>

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-phonon coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “coherent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-phonon coupling affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.</p>

Thermal processing of diblock copolymer melts mimics metallurgy
<p>Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments conducted with compositionally asymmetric low molar mass poly(isoprene)-<i>b</i>-poly(lactide) diblock copolymers reveal an extraordinary thermal history dependence. The development of distinct periodic crystalline or aperiodic quasicrystalline states depends on how specimens are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ed from the disordered state to temperatures below the order-disorder transition temperature. Whereas direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing leads to the formation of documented morphologies, rapidly quenched samples that are then heated from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">low temperatur</span></strong>e form the hexagonal C14 and cubic C15 Laves phases commonly found in metal alloys. Self-consistent mean-field theory calculations show that these, and other associated Frank-Kasper phases, have nearly degenerate free energies, suggesting that processing history drives the material into long-lived metastable states defined by self-assembled particles with discrete populations of volumes and polyhedral shapes.</p>

Buffer-gas cooling of antiprotonic helium to 1.5 to 1.7 K, and antiproton-to–electron mass ratio
<p>Charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry implies that a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass. The antiproton-to-electron mass ratio [Formula] can be precisely determined from the single-photon transition frequencies of antiprotonic helium. We measured 13 such frequencies with laser spectroscopy to a fractional precision of 2.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup> to 16 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. About 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> antiprotonic helium atoms were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ed to temperatures between 1.5 and 1.7 kelvin by using buffer-gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing in cryogenic low-pressure helium gas; the narrow thermal distribution led to the observation of sharp spectral lines of small thermal Doppler width. The deviation between the experimental frequencies and the results of three-body quantum electrodynamics calculations was reduced by a factor of 1.4 to 10 compared with previous single-photon experiments. From this, [Formula] was determined as 1836.1526734(15), which agrees with a recent proton-to-electron experimental value within 8 × 10<sup>−10</sup>.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four petals characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and environmental variation. A variable petal number distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic variation at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> petal number varies in response to seasonal changes in environment. To address this question, we assessed whether petal number responds to a suite of environmental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that petal number showed seasonal variation in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering plants developed more petals than those flowering in summer. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong> ambient temperature, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong> temperature caused the strongest increase in petal number and lengthened the time interval over which floral meristems matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that floral buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of floral meristem formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more space available for petal initiation. In summary, the growth and maturation of floral buds is associated with variable petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i> and responds to seasonal changes in ambient temperature.</p>

Cavity-mediated collective spin-exchange interactions in a strontium superradiant laser
<p>Laser-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ed and quantum degenerate atoms are being pursued as quantum simulators and form the basis of today’s most precise sensors. A key challenge toward these goals is to understand and control coherent interactions between the atoms. We observe long-range exchange interactions mediated by an optical cavity, which manifest as tunable spin-spin interactions on the pseudo spin-½ system composed of the millihertz linewidth clock transition in strontium. This leads to one-axis twisting dynamics, the emergence of a many-body energy gap, and gap protection of the optical coherence against certain sources of decoherence. Our observations will aid in the future design of versatile quantum simulators and the next generation of atomic clocks that use quantum correlations for enhanced metrology.</p>

A blueprint for demonstrating quantum supremacy with superconducting qubits
<p>A key step toward demonstrating a quantum system that can address difficult problems in physics and chemistry will be performing a computation beyond the capabilities of any classical computer, thus achieving so-called quantum supremacy. In this study, we used nine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits to demonstrate a promising path toward quantum supremacy. By individually tuning the qubit parameters, we were able to generate thousands of distinct Hamiltonian evolutions and probe the output probabilities. The measured probabilities obey a universal distribution, consistent with uniformly sampling the full Hilbert space. As the number of qubits increases, the system continues to explore the exponentially growing number of states. Extending these results to a system of 50 qubits has the potential to address scientific questions that are beyond the capabilities of any classical computer.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ed liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Strong spin-photon coupling in silicon
<p>Long coherence times of single spins in silicon quantum dots make these systems highly attractive for quantum computation, but how to scale up spin qubit systems remains an open question. As a first step to address this issue, we demonstrate the strong coupling of a single electron spin and a single microwave photon. The electron spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave photon is stored in an on-chip high-impedance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing resonator. The electric field component of the cavity photon couples directly to the charge dipole of the electron in the double dot, and indirectly to the electron spin, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet. Our results provide a route to realizing large networks of quantum dot–based spin qubit registers.</p>

Maxima in the thermodynamic response and correlation functions of deeply supercooled water
<p>Femtosecond x-ray laser pulses were used to probe micrometer-sized water droplets that were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ed down to 227 kelvin in vacuum. Isothermal compressibility and correlation length were extracted from x-ray scattering at the low–momentum transfer region. The temperature dependence of these thermodynamic response and correlation functions shows maxima at 229 kelvin for water and 233 kelvin for heavy water. In addition, we observed that the liquids undergo the fastest growth of tetrahedral structures at similar temperatures. These observations point to the existence of a Widom line, defined as the locus of maximum correlation length emanating from a critical point at positive pressures in the deeply super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ed regime. The difference in the maximum value of the isothermal compressibility between the two isotopes shows the importance of nuclear quantum effects.</p>

Anomalous spin correlations and excitonic instability of interacting 2D Weyl fermions
<p>The Coulomb interaction in systems of quasi-relativistic massless electrons has an unscreened long-range component at variance with conventional correlated metals.

Combined with model calculations, we show that this divergence stems from an interaction-driven velocity renormalization that almost exclusively suppresses zero-momentum spin fluctuations. At <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">low temperatur</span></strong>es, the NMR relaxation rate shows an unexpected increase; numerical analyses show that this increase corresponds to internode excitonic fluctuations, a precursor to a transition from massless to massive quasiparticles.</p>

Imaging resonant dissipation from individual atomic defects in graphene
<p>Conversion of electric current into heat involves microscopic processes that operate on nanometer length scales and release minute amounts of power. Although central to our understanding of the electrical properties of materials, individual mediators of energy dissipation have so far eluded direct observation. Using scanning nanothermometry with submicrokelvin sensitivity, we visualized and controlled phonon emission from individual atomic-scale defects in graphene. The inferred electron-phonon “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing power spectrum” exhibits sharp peaks when the Fermi level comes into resonance with electronic quasi-bound states at such defects. Rare in the bulk but abundant at graphene’s edges, switchable atomic-scale phonon emitters provide the dominant dissipation mechanism.

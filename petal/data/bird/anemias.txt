Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a genetic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were associated with coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006). In a mediation analysis, the effect of the genetic score on decreased coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e risk extended beyond its effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure. Conversely, rare variants that inactivate the <i>NOS3</i> or <i>GUCY1A3</i> genes were associated with a 23 mm Hg higher systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (95% CI, 12-34; <i>P</i>=5.6*10<sup>–5</sup>) and a 3-fold higher risk of coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (odds ratio, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.29-7.12; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling is associated with reduced risks of coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, peripheral arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, and stroke.

Association Between Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Blood Pressure Among Adults in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of sodium and lower levels of potassium intake are associated with higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure. However, the shape and magnitude of these associations can vary by study participant characteristics or intake assessment method. Twenty-four–hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium are unaffected by recall errors and represent all sources of intake, and were collected for the first time in a nationally representative US survey. Our objective was to assess the associations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure and hypertension with 24-hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium among US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cross-sectional data were obtained from 766 participants age 20 to 69 years with complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure and 24-hour urine collections in the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the US noninstitutionalized population. Usual 24-hour urinary electrolyte excretion (sodium, potassium, and their ratio) was estimated from ≤2 collections on nonconsecutive days, adjusting for day-to-day variability in excretion. Outcomes included systolic and diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure from the average of 3 measures and hypertension status, based on average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure ≥140/90 and antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After multivariable adjustment, each 1000-mg difference in usual 24-hour sodium excretion was directly associated with systolic (4.58 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.64–6.51) and diastolic (2.25 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.83–3.67) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressures. Each 1000-mg difference in potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (–3.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, –6.01 to –1.42). Each 0.5 U difference in sodium-to-potassium ratio was directly associated with systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (1.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.76–2.68). Hypertension was linearly associated with progressively higher sodium and lower potassium excretion; in comparison with the lowest quartile of excretion, the adjusted odds of hypertension for the highest quartile was 4.22 (95% CI, 1.36–13.15) for sodium, and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.17–0.87) for potassium (<i>P</i><0.01 for trends).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These cross-sectional results show a strong dose-response association between urinary sodium excretion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, and an inverse association between urinary potassium excretion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, in a nationally representative sample of US adults.</p></sec>

Day-to-Day Blood Pressure Variability and Risk of Dementia in a General Japanese Elderly Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Several observational studies have reported that higher visit-to-visit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variability is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. However, no studies have investigated the association of day-to-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variability assessed by home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure measurement with the development of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 1674 community-dwelling Japanese elderly without dementia, ≥60 years of age, were followed up for 5 years (2007–2012). Home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure was measured 3 times every morning for a median of 28 days. Day-to-day systolic (SBP) and diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variabilities, calculated as coefficients of variation (CoV) of home SBP and diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, were categorized into quartiles. The hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of the CoV levels of home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure on the development of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia (VaD), and Alzheimer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (AD) were computed with a Cox proportional hazards model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the follow-up, 194 subjects developed all-cause dementia; of these, 47 had VaD and 134 had AD. The age- and sex-adjusted incidences of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD increased significantly with increasing CoV levels of home SBP (all <i>P</i> for trend <0.05). These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including home SBP. Compared with subjects in the first quartile of CoV levels of home SBP, the risks of the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD were significantly higher in those in the fourth quartile (hazard ratio=2.27, 95% confidence interval=1.45–3.55, <i>P</i><0.001 for all-cause dementia; hazard ratio=2.79, 95% confidence interval=1.04–7.51, <i>P</i>=0.03 for VaD; hazard ratio=2.22, 95% confidence interval=1.31–3.75, <i>P</i><0.001 for AD). Similar associations were observed for CoV levels of home diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure.

Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Lowering for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Among Men With Primary Elevations of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels of 190 mg/dL or Above
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with primary elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥190 mg/dL are at a higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e as a result of long-term exposure to markedly elevated LDL-C levels. Therefore, initiation of statin therapy is recommended for these individuals. However, there is a lack of randomized trial evidence supporting these recommendations in primary prevention. In the present analysis, we provide hitherto unpublished data on the cardiovascular effects of LDL-C lowering among a primary prevention population with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We aimed to assess the benefits of LDL-C lowering on cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with primary elevations of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL without preexisting vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e at baseline.

Augmentation of Muscle Blood Flow by Ultrasound Cavitation Is Mediated by ATP and Purinergic Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Augmentation of tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow by therapeutic ultrasound is thought to rely on convective shear. Microbubble contrast agents that undergo ultrasound-mediated cavitation markedly amplify these effects. We hypothesized that purinergic signaling is responsible for shear-dependent increases in muscle perfusion during therapeutic cavitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unilateral exposure of the proximal hindlimb of mice (with or without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> produced by iliac ligation) to therapeutic ultrasound (1.3 MHz, mechanical index 1.3) was performed for 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 2×10<sup>8</sup> lipid microbubbles. Microvascular perfusion was evaluated by low-power contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging. In vivo muscle ATP release and in vitro ATP release from endothelial cells or erythrocytes were assessed by a luciferin-luciferase assay. Purinergic signaling pathways were assessed by studying interventions that (1) accelerated ATP degradation; (2) inhibited P2Y receptors, adenosine receptors, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels; or (3) inhibited downstream signaling pathways involving endothelial nitric oxide synthase or prostanoid production (indomethacin). Augmentation in muscle perfusion by ultrasound cavitation was assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 12 subjects with stable sickle cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound cavitation increased muscle perfusion by 7-fold in normal mice, reversed tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> for up to 24 hours in the murine model of peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, and doubled muscle perfusion in patients with sickle cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Augmentation in flow extended well beyond the region of ultrasound exposure. Ultrasound cavitation produced an ≈40-fold focal and sustained increase in ATP, the source of which included both endothelial cells and erythrocytes. Inhibitory studies indicated that ATP was a critical mediator of flow augmentation that acts primarily through either P2Y receptors or adenosine produced by ectonucleotidase activity. Combined indomethacin and inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase abolished the effects of therapeutic ultrasound, indicating downstream signaling through both nitric oxide and prostaglandins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound using microbubble cavitation to increase muscle perfusion relies on shear-dependent increases in ATP, which can act through a diverse portfolio of purinergic signaling pathways. These events can reverse hindlimb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> in mice for >24 hours and increase muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow in patients with sickle cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal diagnosis, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical management for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted.

MicroRNA-93 Controls Perfusion Recovery After Hindlimb Ischemia by Modulating Expression of Multiple Genes in the Cell Cycle Pathway
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>MicroRNAs are key regulators of gene expression in response to injury, but there is limited knowledge of their role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>-induced angiogenesis, such as in peripheral arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Here, we used an unbiased strategy and took advantage of different phenotypic outcomes that follow surgically induced hindlimb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> between inbred mouse strains to identify key microRNAs involved in perfusion recovery from hindlimb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From comparative microRNA profiling between inbred mouse strains that display profound differences in their extent of perfusion recovery after hindlimb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>, we found that the mouse strain with higher levels of microRNA-93 (miR-93) in hindlimb muscle before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> and the greater ability to upregulate miR-93 in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> had better perfusion recovery. In vitro, overexpression of miR-93 attenuated hypoxia-induced apoptosis in both endothelial and skeletal muscle cells and enhanced proliferation in both cell types. In addition, miR-93 overexpression enhanced endothelial cell tube formation. In vivo, miR-93 overexpression enhanced capillary density and perfusion recovery from hindlimb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>, and antagomirs to miR-93 attenuated perfusion recovery.

A PLCγ1-Dependent, Force-Sensitive Signaling Network in the Myogenic Constriction of Cerebral Arteries
<sec><title>Maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> Flow to the Brain</title><p>Cerebral arteries continually adjust to changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure to ensure constant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow to the brain. In response to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, the smooth muscle cells in cerebral arteries contract, resulting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessel constriction. This response requires two cell surface ion channels—TRPC6, a channel that is activated by the stretch caused by increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, and TRPM4, a channel that triggers the electrical impulses necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessel constriction.

Nitrite and <i>S</i>-Nitrosohemoglobin Exchange Across the Human Cerebral and Femoral Circulation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cell (RBC)–mediated hypoxic vasodilation remain controversial, with separate roles for nitrite ([Formula]) and <i>S</i>-nitroso<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> (SNO-Hb) widely contested given their ability to transduce nitric oxide bioactivity within the microcirculation. To establish their relative contribution in vivo, we quantified arterial-venous concentration gradients across the human cerebral and femoral circulation at rest and during exercise, an ideal model system characterized by physiological extremes of O<sub>2</sub> tension and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Ten healthy participants (5 men, 5 women) aged 24±4 (mean±SD) years old were randomly assigned to a normoxic (21% O<sub>2</sub>) and hypoxic (10% O<sub>2</sub>) trial with measurements performed at rest and after 30 minutes of cycling at 70% of maximal power output in hypoxia and equivalent relative and absolute intensities in normoxia. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> was sampled simultaneously from the brachial artery and internal jugular and femoral veins with plasma and RBC nitric oxide metabolites measured by tri-iodide reductive chemiluminescence. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow was determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow) and constant infusion thermodilution (femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow) with net exchange calculated via the Fick principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Hypoxia was associated with a mild increase in both cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow and femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow (<i>P</i><0.05 versus normoxia) with further, more pronounced increases observed in femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow during exercise (<i>P</i><0.05 versus rest) in proportion to the reduction in RBC oxygenation (<i>r</i>=0.680–0.769, <i>P</i><0.001).

Association of Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Venous Thromboembolism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Much controversy surrounds the association of traditional cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e risk factors with venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an individual level random-effect meta-analysis including 9 prospective studies with measured baseline cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e risk factors and validated VTE events. Definitions were harmonized across studies. Traditional cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e risk factors were modeled categorically and continuously using restricted cubic splines. Estimates were obtained for overall VTE, provoked VTE (ie, VTE occurring in the presence of 1 or more established VTE risk factors), and unprovoked VTE, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The studies included 244 865 participants with 4910 VTE events occurring during a mean follow-up of 4.7 to 19.7 years per study. Age, sex, and body mass index-adjusted hazard ratios for overall VTE were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89−1.07) for hypertension, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88−1.08) for hyperlipidemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89−1.15) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08−1.32) for current smoking. After full adjustment, these estimates were numerically similar. When modeled continuously, an inverse association was observed for systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (hazard ratio=0.79 [95% CI: 0.68−0.92] at systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure 160 vs 110 mm Hg) but not for diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure or lipid measures with VTE. An important finding from VTE subtype analyses was that cigarette smoking was associated with provoked but not unprovoked VTE. Fully adjusted hazard ratios for the associations of current smoking with provoked and unprovoked VTE were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.22−1.52) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.90−1.29), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Except for the association between cigarette smoking and provoked VTE, which is potentially mediated through comorbid conditions such as cancer, the modifiable traditional cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e risk factors are not associated with increased VTE risk.

Percutaneous Therapies for Peripheral Artery Disease
<p>Percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e continue to evolve with new techniques and devices. Although guidelines-recommended therapies have impacted cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, endovascular interventions have been shown to reduce limb pain, improve quality of life, and prolong walking distance for those with claudication and to reduce amputation rates among those with critical limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>. Novel devices such as drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons have improved patency for moderate-length lesions, whereas others allow treatment of heavily calcified and tortuous segments. New adjunctive devices to cross lesions and reduce or modify associated plaque have also been developed, although level 1 data regarding their efficacy are sparse. There has also been a better mechanistic understanding of lower extremity endovascular treatment using tools such as intravascular ultrasound. This information has highlighted the need for better stent size selection for the femoropopliteal arterial segments and larger balloon diameters for the tibial arteries. Moreover, a wound perfusion approach with direct in-line flow, the so-called angiosome approach, and reconstruction of the pedal loop have been advocated for improved wound healing. Technical advances such as the tibiopedal access and reentry methods have allowed crossing of lesions that were considered no option for the endovascular approach in the past. Collectively, there has been increased awareness, interest, and commitment by various specialty societies and organizations to advance the treatment of peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and critical limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>. This is also evident by the recent coalition of 7 professional societies and organizations that represented >150 000 allied health professionals and millions of patients with peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e at the 2015 Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Analysis Committee meeting. The percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e continue to evolve with longer follow-up with randomized data and larger prospective registries. In the future, it is hopeful that we will treat the lower extremity arteries according to segments, taking into account plaque morphology, luminal versus subintimal crossing, location, and stenotic versus occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Until then, we must identify the most cost-effective, efficacious, and safe treatment for each patient. The goal of this article is to aid the practicing vascular specialist consider the optimal choices for the management of patients with vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of carboxy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> (COHb), formed by CO binding to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong>, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> volumes and elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> concentration. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> may also protect against potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

Distribution of Estimated 10-Year Risk of Recurrent Vascular Events and Residual Risk in a Secondary Prevention Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Among patients with clinically manifest vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, the risk of recurrent vascular events is likely to vary. We assessed the distribution of estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events in a secondary prevention population. We also estimated the potential risk reduction and residual risk that can be achieved if patients reach guideline-recommended risk factor targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The SMART score (Second Manifestations of Arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e) for 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death was applied to 6904 patients with vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. The risk score was externally validated in 18 436 patients with various manifestations of vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e from the TNT (Treating to New Targets), IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels), and CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) trials. The residual risk at guideline-recommended targets was estimated by applying relative risk reductions from meta-analyses to the estimated risk for targets for systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, and use of antithrombotic agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The external performance of the SMART risk score was reasonable, apart from overestimation of risk in patients with 10-year risk >40%. In patients with various manifestations of vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, median 10-year risk of a recurrent major vascular event was 17% (interquartile range, 11%–28%), varying from <10% in 18% to >30% in 22% of the patients. If risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, the residual 10-year risk would be <10% in 47% and >30% in 9% of the patients (median, 11%; interquartile range, 7%–17%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, there is very substantial variation in estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events. If all modifiable risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, half of the patients would have a 10-year risk <10%. These data suggest that even with optimal treatment, many patients with vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e will remain at >20% and even >30% 10-year risk, clearly delineating an area of substantial unmet medical need.</p></sec>

Point-of-Care Hemostatic Testing in Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac surgery is frequently complicated by coagulopathic bleeding that is difficult to optimally manage using standard hemostatic testing. We hypothesized that point-of-care hemostatic testing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm would improve the management of coagulopathy in cardiac surgery and thereby reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> transfusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a pragmatic multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial of a point-of-care–based transfusion algorithm in consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 12 hospitals from October 6, 2014, to May 1, 2015. Following a 1-month data collection at all participating hospitals, a transfusion algorithm incorporating point-of-care hemostatic testing was sequentially implemented at 2 hospitals at a time in 1-month intervals, with the implementation order randomly assigned. No other aspects of care were modified. The primary outcome was red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cell transfusion from surgery to postoperative day 7. Other outcomes included transfusion of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> products, major bleeding, and major complications. The analysis adjusted for secular time trends, within-hospital clustering, and patient-level risk factors. All outcomes and analyses were prespecified before study initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 7402 patients studied, 3555 underwent surgery during the control phase and 3847 during the intervention phase. Overall, 3329 (45.0%) received red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cells, 1863 (25.2%) received platelets, 1645 (22.2%) received plasma, and 394 (5.3%) received cryoprecipitate.

Aggregates of β amyloid [a protein produced through cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP)] are seen in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es and in PD patients carrying G2019S-mutant LRRK2. Using patient-derived cells, brain tissue, and PD model mice, we found that LRRK2 interacted with and phosphorylated APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> within its intracellular domain (AICD). Phosphorylation of APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> promoted AICD transcriptional activity and correlated with increased nuclear abundance of AICD and decreased abundance of a dopaminergic neuron marker in cultures and brain tissue. The AICD regulates the transcription of genes involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and apoptosis. Overexpression of AICD, but not a phosphodeficient mutant (AICD<sup>T668A</sup>), increased the loss of dopaminergic neurons in older mice expressing LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup>. Moreover, the amount of Thr<sup>668</sup>-phosphorylated APP was substantially greater in postmortem brain tissue and dopaminergic neurons (generated by reprogramming skin cells) from LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> patients than in those from healthy individuals. LRRK2 inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation of APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> in the patient-derived dopaminergic neurons and in the midbrains of LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> mice. Thus, APP is a substrate of LRRK2, and its phosphorylation promotes AICD function and neurotoxicity in PD.</p>

Understanding Lassa fever
<p>Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever prevalent in West Africa that has been gaining international attention as an emerging infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e with the potential to cause epidemics (<i>1</i>). Confirmed and suspected cases of Lassa fever have been steadily rising in Nigeria over the past 3 years. Laboratory-confirmed cases have increased from 106 in 2016 to 143 in 2017 and had already reached 562 by November 2018 (<i>2</i>). Part of defining the scope of the problem is trying to assess whether this is a true increase in the number of people afflicted by the infection, due to either changes in the virus itself or the geographical spread of the vector (rodents of the <i>Mastomys</i> spp.), or a reflection of higher rates of detection and diagnosis secondary to the increased attention and interest of clinicians and laboratorians (<i>1</i>). Lassa fever outbreaks illustrate the issues associated with the response and management of emerging infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es: How do you plan the public health, clinical, and community responses to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e while you are still learning about the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and the ecological factors contributing to the spread of the pathogen? On page 74 of this issue, Kafetzopoulou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) present the results of a rapid genomic study of Lassa virus (LASV) from the cases of 2018, which have improved understanding of how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e has been spreading in Nigeria and have led to informed and targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-control strategies. The study also further describes the use of a new and compact genomic sequencing device, which may start playing a larger role in defining other emerging infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e outbreaks in real time.</p>

<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Induces the Expression of a MicroRNA to Suppress the Immune Response in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs play crucial roles in plant responses to pathogen infections. The rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). To explore the microRNA species that participate in rice immunity against the rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, we compared the expression of small RNAs between mock- and <i>M. oryzae</i>-treated rice. We found that infection by <i>M. oryzae</i> strain Guy11 specifically induced the expression of rice miR319 and, consequently, suppressed its target gene <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR1</i> (<i>OsTCP21</i>), which encodes a transcription factor. Using transgenic rice that overexpresses miR319b (OE) or expresses <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res (which is resistant to miR319-mediated silencing), we found that <i>OsTCP21</i> is a positive regulator of the rice defense response against the blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. When wild-type and miR319b-OE rice were infected by Guy11, multiple jasmonic acid (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating that Guy11 suppresses JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that <i>LIPOXYGENASE2</i> (<i>LOX2</i>) and <i>LOX5</i> were specifically suppressed by miR319 overexpression or by Guy11 infection. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA synthesis, which catalyze the conversion of α-linoleic acid to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid. The application of α-linoleic acid rescued <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e symptoms on the <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res rice but not wild-type rice, supporting our hypothesis that <i>OsLOX2</i> and <i>OsLOX5</i> are the key JA synthesis genes hijacked by Guy11 to subvert host immunity and facilitate pathogenicity. We propose that induced expression of <i>OsLOX2/5</i> may improve resistance to the rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

Single-Cell Sequencing of the Healthy and Diseased Heart Reveals Cytoskeleton-Associated Protein 4 as a New Modulator of Fibroblasts Activation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Genome-wide transcriptome analysis has greatly advanced our understanding of the regulatory networks underlying basic cardiac biology and mechanisms driving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. However, so far, the resolution of studying gene expression patterns in the adult heart has been limited to the level of extracts from whole tissues. The use of tissue homogenates inherently causes the loss of any information on cellular origin or cell type-specific changes in gene expression. Recent developments in RNA amplification strategies provide a unique opportunity to use small amounts of input RNA for genome-wide sequencing of single cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we present a method to obtain high-quality RNA from digested cardiac tissue from adult mice for automated single-cell sequencing of both the healthy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After optimization, we were able to perform single-cell sequencing on adult cardiac tissue under both homeostatic conditions and after ischemic injury. Clustering analysis based on differential gene expression unveiled known and novel markers of all main cardiac cell types. Based on differential gene expression, we could identify multiple subpopulations within a certain cell type. Furthermore, applying single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and injured heart indicated the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-specific cell subpopulations. As such, we identified cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 as a novel marker for activated fibroblasts that positively correlates with known myofibroblast markers in both mouse and human cardiac tissue. Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 inhibition in activated fibroblasts treated with transforming growth factor β triggered a greater increase in the expression of genes related to activated fibroblasts compared with control, suggesting a role of cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 in modulating fibroblast activation in the injured heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed adult heart allows us to study transcriptomic differences between cardiac cells, as well as cell type-specific changes in gene expression during cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.

Bmal1 in Perivascular Adipose Tissue Regulates Resting-Phase Blood Pressure Through Transcriptional Regulation of Angiotensinogen
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding vessels constitutes a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature required to preserve vascular tone under physiological conditions. However, there is little information on the relationship between PVAT and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure regulation, including its potential contributions to circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using unique brown adipocyte–specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and angiotensinogen knockout mice, we determined the vasoactivity of homogenized PVAT in aortic rings and how brown adipocyte peripheral expression of Bmal1 and angiotensinogen in PVAT regulates the amplitude of diurnal change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We uncovered a peripheral clock in PVAT and demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 in PVAT reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure in mice during the resting phase, leading to a superdipper phenotype. PVAT extracts from wild-type mice significantly induced contractility of isolated aortic rings in vitro in an endothelium-independent manner. This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte–selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local angiotensin II, operating through angiotensin II type 1 receptor–dependent signaling in the isolated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian regulation of angiotensinogen. Indeed, angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced. Systemic infusion of angiotensin II, in turn, reduced Bmal1 expression in PVAT while eliminating the hypotensive phenotype during the resting phase in BA-Bmal1-KO mice. Angiotensinogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective deletion of angiotensinogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective deletion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, angiotensinogen is a transcriptional target of Bmal1 in PVAT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data indicate that local Bmal1 in PVAT regulates angiotensinogen expression and the ensuing increase in angiotensin II, which acts on smooth muscle cells in the vessel walls to regulate vasoactivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure in a circadian fashion during the resting phase. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular complications of circadian disorders, alterations in the circadian dipping phenotype, and cross-talk between systemic and peripheral regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure.</p></sec>

Mental Stress–Induced-Myocardial Ischemia in Young Patients With Recent Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mental stress-induced myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received <sup>99m</sup>Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22–61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22% versus 11%, <i>P</i>=0.009), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, <i>P</i>=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women’s proclivity toward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> because of microcirculatory abnormalities.</p></sec>

Improving 1-Year Outcomes of Infrainguinal Limb Revascularization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The availability and diversity of lower limb revascularization procedures have increased in England in the past decade. We investigated whether these developments in care have translated to improvements in patient pathways and outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Individual-patient records from Hospital Episode Statistics were used to identify 103 934 patients who underwent endovascular (angioplasty) or surgical (endarterectomy, profundaplasty, or bypass) lower limb revascularization for infrainguinal peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in England between January 2006 and December 2015. Major lower limb amputations and deaths within 1 year after revascularization were ascertained from Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics mortality records. Competing risks regression was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of major amputation and death, adjusted for patient age, sex, comorbidity score, indication for the intervention (intermittent claudication, severe limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> without record of tissue loss, severe limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> with a record of ulceration, severe limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> with a record of gangrene/osteomyelitis), and comorbid diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated 1-year risk of major amputation decreased from 5.7% (in 2006–2007) to 3.9% (in 2014–2015) following endovascular revascularization, and from 11.2% (2006–2007) to 6.6% (2014–2015) following surgical procedures. The risk of death after both types of revascularization also decreased. These trends were observed for all indication categories, with the largest reductions found in patients with severe limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> with ulceration or gangrene.

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome

Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 proteins might identify genetic determinants of risk-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of genetic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e Risk Score–associated proteins using linear mixed-effects models in 2 population-based cohorts.

To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipoprotein E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-protein associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously.

Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es study.

Restoration of Hydrogen Sulfide Production in Diabetic Mice Improves Reparative Function of Bone Marrow Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bone marrow cell (BMC)–based treatment for critical limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> in diabetic patients yielded a modest therapeutic effect resulting from cell dysfunction. Therefore, approaches that improve diabetic stem/progenitor cell functions may provide therapeutic benefits. Here, we tested the hypothesis that restoration of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) production in diabetic BMCs improves their reparative capacities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Mouse BMCs were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation. Unilateral hind limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> was conducted in 12- to 14-week-old db/+ and db/db mice by ligation of the left femoral artery. The H<sub>2</sub>S level was measured by either gas chromatography or staining with florescent dye sulfidefluor 7 <sc>AM</sc>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both H<sub>2</sub>S production and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), an H<sub>2</sub>S enzyme, levels were significantly decreased in BMCs from diabetic db/db mice. Administration of H<sub>2</sub>S donor diallyl trisulfide (DATS) or overexpression of CSE restored H<sub>2</sub>S production and enhanced cell survival and migratory capacity in high glucose (HG)–treated BMCs. Immediately after hind limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> surgery, the db/+ and db/db mice were administered DATS orally and/or given a local intramuscular injection of green fluorescent protein–labeled BMCs or red fluorescent protein–CSE–overexpressing BMCs (CSE-BMCs). Mice with hind limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> were divided into 6 groups: db/+, db/db, db/db+BMCs, db/db+DATS, db/db+DATS+BMCs, and db/db+CSE-BMCs. DATS and CSE overexpression greatly enhanced diabetic BMC retention in ischemic hind limbs followed by improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> perfusion, capillary/arteriole density, skeletal muscle architecture, and cell survival and decreased perivascular CD68<sup>+</sup> cell infiltration in the ischemic hind limbs of diabetic mice. It is interesting to note that DATS or CSE overexpression rescued high glucose–impaired migration, tube formation, and survival of BMCs or mature human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Moreover, DATS restored nitric oxide production and decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation at threonine 495 levels in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells and improved BMC angiogenic activity under high glucose condition. Last, silencing CSE by siRNA significantly increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation at threonine 495 levels in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Decreased CSE-mediated H<sub>2</sub>S bioavailability is an underlying source of BMC dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. Our data indicate that H<sub>2</sub>S and overexpression of CSE in diabetic BMCs may rescue their dysfunction and open novel avenues for cell-based therapeutics of critical limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> in diabetic patients.</p></sec>

Clinical Outcomes in 3343 Children and Adults With Rheumatic Heart Disease From 14 Low- and Middle-Income Countries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>There are few contemporary data on the mortality and morbidity associated with rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e or information on their predictors. We report the 2-year follow-up of individuals with rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e from 14 low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between January 2010 and November 2012, we enrolled 3343 patients from 25 centers in 14 countries and followed them for 2 years to assess mortality, congestive heart failure, stroke or transient ischemic attack, recurrent acute rheumatic fever, and infective endocarditis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Vital status at 24 months was known for 2960 (88.5%) patients. Two-thirds were female. Although patients were young (median age, 28 years; interquartile range, 18–40), the 2-year case fatality rate was high (500 deaths, 16.9%). Mortality rate was 116.3/1000 patient-years in the first year and 65.4/1000 patient-years in the second year. Median age at death was 28.7 years. Independent predictors of death were severe valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (hazard ratio [HR], 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80–3.11), congestive heart failure (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.70–2.72), New York Heart Association functional class III/IV (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.32–2.10), atrial fibrillation (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.10–1.78), and older age (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.02 per year increase) at enrollment. Postprimary education (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54–0.85) and female sex (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52–0.80) were associated with lower risk of death. Two hundred and four (6.9%) patients had new congestive heart failure (incidence, 38.42/1000 patient-years), 46 (1.6%) had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (8.45/1000 patient-years), 19 (0.6%) had recurrent acute rheumatic fever (3.49/1000 patient-years), and 20 (0.7%) had infective endocarditis (3.65/1000 patient-years). Previous stroke and older age were independent predictors of stroke/transient ischemic attack or systemic embolism. Patients from low- and lower-middle–income countries had significantly higher age- and sex-adjusted mortality than patients from upper-middle–income countries.

We report the influence of adherence to antihypertensive treatment on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure control.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred six patients with hypertension resistant to 4 weeks of treatment with indapamide 1.5 mg/d, ramipril 10 mg/d (or irbesartan 300 mg/d), and amlodipine 10 mg/d were randomly assigned to renal denervation plus standardized stepped-care antihypertensive treatment, or the same antihypertensive treatment alone. For standardized stepped-care antihypertensive treatment, spironolactone 25 mg/d, bisoprolol 10 mg/d, prazosin 5 mg/d, and rilmenidine 1 mg/d were sequentially added at monthly visits if home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure was ≥135/85 mm Hg after randomization. We assessed adherence to antihypertensive treatment at 6 months by drug screening in urine/plasma samples from 85 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The numbers of fully adherent (20/40 versus 21/45), partially nonadherent (13/40 versus 20/45), or completely nonadherent patients (7/40 versus 4/45) to antihypertensive treatment were not different in the renal denervation and the control groups, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.3605). The difference in the change in daytime ambulatory systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure from baseline to 6 months between the 2 groups was –6.7 mm Hg (<i>P</i>=0.0461) in fully adherent and –7.8 mm Hg (<i>P</i>=0.0996) in nonadherent (partially nonadherent plus completely nonadherent) patients.

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological deterioration, or deformity   correction in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological deterioration at a mean of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   deterioration were healed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Eight patients without neurological deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.

The impact of external fixation on mortality in patients with an unstable pelvic ring fracture
<sec><title>Aim</title><p>There is not adequate evidence to establish whether external   fixation (EF) of pelvic fractures leads to a reduced mortality.   We used the Japan Trauma Data Bank database to identify isolated   unstable pelvic ring fractures to exclude the possibility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>   loss from other injuries, and analyzed the effectiveness of EF on   mortality in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a registry-based comparison of 1163 patients who had   been treated for an isolated unstable pelvic ring fracture with   (386 patients) or without (777 patients) EF. An isolated pelvic   ring fracture was defined by an Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for   other injuries of < 3. An unstable pelvic ring fracture was defined   as having an AIS ≥ 4. The primary outcome of this study was mortality.   A subgroup analysis was carried out for patients who required <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>   transfusion within 24 hours of arrival in the Emergency Department   and those who had massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> loss (AIS code: 852610.5).

Pregnancy Outcomes in Women With Rheumatic Mitral Valve Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is 1 of the major causes of maternal mortality. We studied pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatic mitral valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The Registry of Pregnancy and Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is an international prospective registry, and consecutive pregnant women with cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e were included. Pregnancy outcomes in all women with rheumatic mitral valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and no prepregnancy valve replacement is described in the present study (n=390). A maternal cardiac event was defined as cardiac death, arrhythmia requiring treatment, heart failure, thromboembolic event, aortic dissection, endocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, and hospitalization for other cardiac reasons or cardiac intervention. Associations between patient characteristics and cardiac outcomes were checked in a 3-level model (patient–center–country).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Most patients came from emerging countries (75%). Mitral stenosis (MS) with or without mitral regurgitation (MR) was present in 273 women, isolated MR in 117. The degree of MS was mild in 20.9%, moderate in 39.2%, severe in 19.8%, and severity not classified in the remainder. Maternal death during pregnancy occurred in 1 patient with severe MS. Hospital admission occurred in 23.1% of the women with MS, and the main reason was heart failure (mild MS 15.8%, moderate 23.4%, severe 48.1%; <i>P</i><0.001). Heart failure occurred in 23.1% of patients with moderate or severe MR. An intervention during pregnancy was performed in 16 patients, 14 had percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy, and 2 had surgical valve replacement (1 for MS, 1 for MR). In multivariable modeling, prepregnancy New York Heart Association class >1 was an independent predictor of maternal cardiac events. Follow-up at 6 months postpartum was available for 53%, and 3 more patients died (1 with severe MS, 1 with moderate MS, 1 with moderate to severe MR).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although mortality was only 1.9% during pregnancy, ≈50% of the patients with severe rheumatic MS and 23% of those with significant MR developed heart failure during pregnancy. Prepregnancy counseling and considering mitral valve interventions in selected patients are important to prevent these complications.</p></sec>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap junction remodeling in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral gap junction proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were identified as novel mRNA targets of FXR1 by using a BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and stabilization of its mRNA targets in heart muscle. In addition, introduction of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of gap junctions and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e progression by regulating gap junction remodeling. Together this study provides a novel function of FXR1, namely, that it directly regulates major gap junction components, contributing to proper cell-cell communication in the heart.</p></sec>

Despite the prevalence of MV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (MVD), the cellular and molecular pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory molecules from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhesion molecule very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative molecules including arginase-1 and resistin-like molecule α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule–1. Conditionally deleting the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.

miR-22 Is a Novel Mediator of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Modulation and Neointima Formation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>MicroRNA-22 (miR-22) has recently been reported to play a regulatory role during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from stem cells, but little is known about its target genes and related pathways in mature VSMC phenotypic modulation or its clinical implication in neointima formation following vascular injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a wire-injury mouse model, and local delivery of AgomiR-22 or miR-22 inhibitor, as well, to explore the therapeutic potential of miR-22 in vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. Furthermore, normal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed human femoral arteries were harvested, and various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models of VSMC phenotype switching were conducted to examine miR-22 expression during VSMC phenotype switching.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Expression of miR-22 was closely regulated during VSMC phenotypic modulation. miR-22 overexpression significantly increased expression of VSMC marker genes and inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, whereas the opposite effect was observed when endogenous miR-22 was knocked down. As expected, 2 previously reported miR-22 target genes, MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and histone deacetylase 4, exhibited a regulatory role in VSMC phenotypic modulation. A transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein, EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 protein homolog), has been identified as a novel miR-22 target gene in VSMC phenotypic modulation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of miR-22 in the injured vessels significantly reduced the expression of its target genes, decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries, whereas the opposite effect was observed with local application of a miR-22 inhibitor to injured arteries. We next examined the clinical relevance of miR-22 expression and its target genes in human femoral arteries. We found that miR-22 expression was significantly reduced, whereas MECP2 and EVI1 expression levels were dramatically increased, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed in comparison with healthy femoral human arteries. This inverse relationship between miR-22 and MECP2 and EVI1 was evident in both healthy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed human femoral arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate that miR-22 and EVI1 are novel regulators of VSMC function, specifically during neointima hyperplasia, offering a novel therapeutic opportunity for treating vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es.</p></sec>

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals between PM<sub>2.5</sub> (per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e mortality using the full sample and the sample adults, which have information on additional health variables. Interaction terms were used to examine differences in the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mortality association by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 65 936 of the full sample died during follow-up, and 22 152 died from heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. After adjustment for several factors, we found a significant positive association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e mortality (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.25). This association was similar in sample adults with adjustment for smoking and body mass index (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.31). Interaction terms for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic groups compared with the non-Hispanic white group were not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Using a nationally representative sample, the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e mortality was elevated and similar to previous estimates. Associations for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults were not statistically significantly different from those for non-Hispanic white adults.</p></sec>

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the risk of long-term side effects limit the success of existing therapeutic agents. Although Tspan12 has been shown to regulate retinal vascular development, nothing is known about its involvement in neovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vasoproliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rodent models of retinal neovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, including the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy and the very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model were analyzed for Tspan/β-catenin regulation. Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12. Therapeutic effects of the newly developed Ab on vascular endothelial cells were tested in vitro and in vivo in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The newly developed anti-Tspan12 Ab exhibited potent inhibitory effects on endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the Ab inhibited the interaction between Tspan12 and Frizzled-4 and effectively modulates β-catenin levels and target genes in vascular endothelial cells. Tspan12/β-catenin signaling was activated in response to acute and chronic stress in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor mouse model of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal application of the Ab showed significant therapeutic effects in both models without inducing negative side effects on retina function. Moreover, combined intravitreal injection of the Ab with a known vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, Aflibercept, resulted in significant enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of each monotherapy. Combination therapy with the Tspan12 blocking antibody can be used to reduce anti-vascular endothelial growth factor doses, thus decreasing the risk of long-term off-target effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tspan12/β-catenin signaling is critical for the progression of vasoproliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. The newly developed anti-Tspan12 antibody has therapeutic effects in vasoproliferative retinopathy and can enhance the potency of existing anti- vascular endothelial growth factor agents.</p></sec>

J Curve in Patients Randomly Assigned to Different Systolic Blood Pressure Targets
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Low systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (SBP) values are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, giving rise to the so-called J-curve phenomenon. We assessed the association between on-treatment SBP levels, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in patients randomized to different SBP targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from 2 large randomized trials that randomly allocated hypertensive patients at high risk for cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e to intensive (SBP<120 mm Hg) or conventional (SBP<140 mm Hg) treatment were pooled and harmonized for outcomes and follow-up duration. Using natural cubic splines, we plotted the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events against the mean on-treatment SBP per treatment group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The pooled data consisted of 194 875 on-treatment SBP measurements in 13 946 patients (98.9%). During a median follow-up of 3.3 years, cardiovascular events occurred in 1014 patients (7.3%), and 502 patients died (3.7%). For both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure targets, an identical shape of the J curve was present, with a nadir for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality just below the SBP target. Patients in the lowest SBP stratum were older, had a higher body mass index, smoked more often, and had a higher frequency of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Low on-treatment SBP levels are associated with increased cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. This association is independent of the attained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure level because the J curve aligns with the SBP target.

Transcription Factor RUNX1 Regulates Platelet <i>PCTP</i> (Phosphatidylcholine Transfer Protein): Implications for Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>PCTP (phosphatidylcholine transfer protein) regulates the intermembrane transfer of phosphatidylcholine. Higher platelet PCTP expression is associated with increased platelet responses on activation of protease-activated receptor 4 thrombin receptors noted in black subjects compared with white subjects. Little is known about the regulation of platelet <i>PCTP</i>. Haplodeficiency of RUNX1, a major hematopoietic transcription factor, is associated with thrombocytopenia and impaired platelet responses on activation. Platelet expression profiling of a patient with a <i>RUNX1</i> loss-of-function mutation revealed a 10-fold downregulation of the <i>PCTP</i> gene compared with healthy controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We pursued the hypothesis that <i>PCTP</i> is regulated by RUNX1 and that <i>PCTP</i> expression is correlated with cardiovascular events. We studied RUNX1 binding to the <i>PCTP</i> promoter using DNA-protein binding studies and human erythroleukemia cells and promoter activity using luciferase reporter studies. We assessed the relationship between <i>RUNX1</i> and <i>PCTP</i> in peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> RNA and <i>PCTP</i> and death or myocardial infarction in 2 separate patient cohorts (587 total patients) with cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Platelet PCTP protein in the patient was reduced by ≈50%. DNA-protein binding studies showed RUNX1 binding to consensus sites in ≈1 kB of <i>PCTP</i> promoter. <i>PCTP</i> expression was increased with <i>RUNX1</i> overexpression and reduced with <i>RUNX1</i> knockdown in human erythroleukemia cells, indicating that <i>PCTP</i> is regulated by RUNX1. Studies in 2 cohorts of patients showed that <i>RUNX1</i> expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> correlated with <i>PCTP</i> gene expression; <i>PCTP</i> expression was higher in black compared with white subjects and was associated with future death/myocardial infarction after adjustment for age, sex, and race (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval 1.6–2.7; <i>P</i><0.0001). <i>RUNX1</i> expression is known to initiate at 2 alternative promoters, a distal P1 and a proximal P2 promoter. In patient cohorts, there were differential effects of <i>RUNX1</i> isoforms on <i>PCTP</i> expression with a negative correlation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> between <i>RUNX1</i> expressed from the P1 promoter and <i>PCTP</i> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><i>PCTP</i> is a direct transcriptional target of RUNX1. <i>PCTP</i> expression is associated with death/myocardial infarction in patients with cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. RUNX1 regulation of <i>PCTP</i> may play a role in the pathogenesis of platelet-mediated cardiovascular events.</p></sec>

Primary outcomes were CHD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major stroke subtypes; secondary analyses included 18 cardiometabolic traits.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each one standard deviation (SD) higher WHRadjBMI (1 SD≈0.08 U) associated with a 48% excess risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR] for CHD, 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28–1.71), similar to findings for BMI (1 SD≈4.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; OR for CHD, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.22–1.52). Only WHRadjBMI increased risk of ischemic stroke (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03–1.70). For type 2 diabetes mellitus, both measures had large effects: OR, 1.82 (95% CI, 1.38–2.42) and OR, 1.98 (95% CI, 1.41–2.78) per 1 SD higher WHRadjBMI and BMI, respectively. Both WHRadjBMI and BMI were associated with higher left ventricular hypertrophy, glycemic traits, interleukin 6, and circulating lipids. WHRadjBMI was also associated with higher carotid intima-media thickness (39%; 95% CI, 9%–77% per 1 SD).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Both general and central adiposity have causal effects on CHD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Existence, Functional Impairment, and Lung Repair Potential of Endothelial Colony-Forming Cells in Oxygen-Induced Arrested Alveolar Growth
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and emphysema are life-threatening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es resulting from impaired alveolar development or alveolar destruction. Both conditions lack effective therapies. Angiogenic growth factors promote alveolar growth and contribute to alveolar maintenance. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) represent a subset of circulating and resident endothelial cells capable of self-renewal and de novo vessel formation. We hypothesized that resident ECFCs exist in the developing lung, that they are impaired during arrested alveolar growth in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and that exogenous ECFCs restore disrupted alveolar growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Human fetal and neonatal rat lungs contain ECFCs with robust proliferative potential, secondary colony formation on replating, and de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessel formation in vivo when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. In contrast, human fetal lung ECFCs exposed to hyperoxia in vitro and neonatal rat ECFCs isolated from hyperoxic alveolar growth–arrested rat lungs mimicking bronchopulmonary dysplasia proliferated less, showed decreased clonogenic capacity, and formed fewer capillary-like networks. Intrajugular administration of human cord <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>–derived ECFCs after established arrested alveolar growth restored lung function, alveolar and lung vascular growth, and attenuated pulmonary hypertension. Lung ECFC colony- and capillary-like network-forming capabilities were also restored.

Lipidomics Profiling and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in the Prospective Population-Based Bruneck Study
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The bulk of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e risk is not explained by traditional risk factors. Recent advances in mass spectrometry allow the identification and quantification of hundreds of lipid species. Molecular lipid profiling by mass spectrometry may improve cardiovascular risk prediction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Lipids were extracted from 685 plasma samples of the prospective population-based Bruneck Study (baseline evaluation in 2000). One hundred thirty-five lipid species from 8 different lipid classes were profiled by shotgun lipidomics with the use of a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Levels of individual species of cholesterol esters (CEs), lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), sphingomyelins, and triacylglycerols (TAGs) were associated with cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e over a 10-year observation period (2000–2010, 90 incident events).

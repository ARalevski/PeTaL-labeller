Root Cell-Specific Regulators of Phosphate-Dependent Growth
<p>Cellular specialization in abiotic stress responses is an important regulatory feature driving plant acclimation. Our in silico approach of iterative coexpression, interaction, and enrichment analyses predicted root cell-specific regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation response networks in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). This included three uncharacterized genes termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation-induced gene interacting Root Cell Enriched (<i>PRCE1</i>, <i>PRCE2</i>, and <i>PRCE3</i>). Root cell-specific enrichment of 12 candidates was confirmed in promoter-GFP lines. T-DNA insertion lines of 11 genes showed changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e status and growth responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e availability compared with the wild type. Some mutants (<i>cbl1</i>, <i>cipk2</i>, <i>prce3</i>, and <i>wdd1</i>) displayed strong biomass gain irrespective of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e supply, while others (<i>cipk14</i>, <i>mfs1</i>, <i>prce1</i>, <i>prce2</i>, and <i>s6k2</i>) were able to sustain growth under low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e supply better than the wild type. Notably, root or shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e accumulation did not strictly correlate with organ growth. Mutant response patterns markedly differed from those of master regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e homeostasis, <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>E STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> (<i>PHR1</i>) and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>E2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>), demonstrating that negative growth responses in the latter can be overcome when cell-specific regulators are targeted. RNA sequencing analysis highlighted the transcriptomic plasticity in these mutants and revealed PHR1-dependent and -independent regulatory circuits with gene coexpression profiles that were highly correlated to the quantified physiological traits. The results demonstrate how in silico prediction of cell-specific, stress-responsive genes uncovers key regulators and how their manipulation can have positive impacts on plant growth under abiotic stress.</p>

The Phosphate Fast-Responsive Genes <i>PECP1</i> and <i>PPsPase1</i> Affect Phosphocholine and Phosphoethanolamine Content<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation-mediated induction of the HAD-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>ases PPsPase1 (AT1G73010) and PECP1 (AT1G17710) has been reported in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, little is known about their in vivo function or impact on plant responses to nutrient deficiency. The preferences of PPsPase1 and PECP1 for different substrates have been studied in vitro but require confirmation in planta. Here, we examined the in vivo function of both enzymes using a reverse genetics approach. We demonstrated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 affect plant phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine content, but not the pyro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e-related phenotypes. These observations suggest that the enzymes play a similar role in planta related to the recycling of polar heads from membrane lipids that is triggered during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation. Altering the expression of the genes encoding these enzymes had no effect on lipid composition, possibly due to compensation by other lipid recycling pathways triggered during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation. Furthermore, our results indicated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 do not influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e homeostasis, since the inactivation of these genes had no effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e content or on the induction of molecular markers related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation. A combination of transcriptomics and imaging analyses revealed that PPsPase1 and PECP1 display a highly dynamic expression pattern that closely mirrors the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e status. This temporal dynamism, combined with the wide range of induction levels, broad expression, and lack of a direct effect on Pi content and regulation, makes PPsPase1 and PECP1 useful molecular markers of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation response.</p>

Proline Accumulation Is Regulated by Transcription Factors Associated with Phosphate Starvation
<p>Pro accumulation in plants is a well-documented physiological response to osmotic stress caused by drought or salinity. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the stress and ABA-induced Δ1-PYRROLINE-5-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHETASE1 (<i>P5CS1</i>) gene was previously shown to control Pro biosynthesis in such adverse conditions. To identify regulatory factors that control the transcription of <i>P5CS1</i>, Y1H screens were performed with a genomic fragment of <i>P5CS1</i>, containing 1.2-kB promoter and 0.8-kb transcribed regions. The myeloblastosis (MYB)-type transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>E STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) and PHR1-LIKE1 (PHL1) were identified to bind to <i>P5CS1</i> regulatory sequences in the first intron, which carries a conserved PHR1-binding site (P1BS) motif. Binding of PHR1 and PHL1 factors to P1BS was confirmed by Y1H, electrophoretic mobility assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation led to gradual increase in Pro content in wild-type Arabidopsis plants as well as transcriptional activation of <i>P5CS1</i> and PRO DEHYDROGENASE2 genes. Induction of <i>P5CS1</i> transcription and Pro accumulation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e deficiency was considerably reduced by <i>phr1</i> and <i>phl1</i> mutations and was impaired in the ABA-deficient <i>aba2-3</i> and ABA-insensitive <i>abi4-1</i> mutants. Growth and viability of <i>phr1phl1</i> double mutant was significantly reduced in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e-depleted medium, while growth was only marginally affected in the <i>aba2-3</i> mutants, suggesting that ABA is implicated in growth retardation in such nutritional stress. Our results reveal a previously unknown link between Pro metabolism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e nutrition and show that Pro biosynthesis is target of cross talk between ABA signaling and regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e homeostasis through PHR1- and PHL1-mediated transcriptional activation of the <i>P5CS1</i> gene.</p>

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p>Lipid A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. Lipid A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>es of lipid A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different lipid A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the lipid A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>es with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory protein PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e group to lipid A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modification of the lipid A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>es with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modification of lipid A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>es solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in lipid A negative charge. Our findings demonstrate how bacteria tailor their cell surface to different stresses, such as those faced inside phagocytes.</p>

Starch Turnover and Metabolism during Flower and Early Embryo Development
<p>The accumulation of starch within photosynthetic tissues and within dedicated storage organs has been characterized extensively in many species, and a function in buffering carbon availability or in fueling later growth phases, respectively, has been proposed. However, developmentally regulated starch turnover within heterotrophic tissues other than dedicated storage organs is poorly characterized, and its function is not well understood. Here, we report on the characterization of starch turnover during flower, early embryo, and silique development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a combined clearing-staining technique on whole-mount tissue. Besides the two previously documented waves of transient starch accumulation in the stamen envelope, occurring during meiosis and pollen mitosis I, we identified a novel, third wave of starch amylogenesis/amylolysis during the last stages of stamen development. To gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, we analyzed publicly available microarray data, which revealed a developmentally coordinated expression of carbohydrate transport and metabolism genes during these waves of transient starch accumulation. Based on this analysis, we characterized starch dynamics in mutants affecting hexose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e metabolism and translocation, and identified the Glc-6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e antiporter GPT1 as the putative translocator of Glc-6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e for starch biosynthesis in reproductive tissues. Based on these results, we propose a model of starch synthesis within the pollen grain and discuss the nutrient transport route feeding the embryo within the developing seed.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in metabolism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target metabolome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 metabolites showed dynamic changes in metabolites related to amino acid biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary metabolism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these metabolic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary metabolism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s metabolic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.</p>

Phosphoric acid as a precursor to chemicals traditionally synthesized from white phosphorus
<p>White phosphorus, generated in the legacy thermal process for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e rock upgrading, has long been the key industrial intermediate for the synthesis of phosphorus-containing chemicals, including herbicides, flame-retardants, catalyst ligands, battery electrolytes, pharmaceuticals, and detergents. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e fertilizers are made on a much larger scale from phosphoric acid, obtained by treating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e rock with sulfuric acid.

Trehalose 6-Phosphate Regulates Photosynthesis and Assimilate Partitioning in Reproductive Tissue<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) that expresses rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>TREHALOSE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>E <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>ASE1</i> (<i>TPP1</i>) from the rice <i>MADS6</i> promoter, which is active over the flowering period, produces higher yields than wild type. This yield increase occurs with or without drought conditions during flowering. To understand the mechanistic basis of the increased yield, we characterized gene expression and metabolite profiles in leaves and developing female reproductive tissue, comprising florets, node, pith, and shank, over the flowering period with and without drought. The <i>MADS6</i> promoter was most active in the vasculature, particularly phloem companion cells in florets and pith, consistent with the largest decreases in trehalose 6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (T6P) levels (2- to 3-fold) being found in pith and florets. Low T6P led to decreased gene expression for primary metabolism and increased gene expression for secondary metabolism, particularly lipid-related pathways. Despite similar changes in gene expression, the pith and floret displayed opposing assimilate profiles: sugars, sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>es, amino acids, and lipids increased in florets, but decreased in pith. Possibly explaining this assimilate distribution, seven <i>SWEET</i> genes were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic plants. SnRK1 activity and the expression of the gene for the SnRK1 beta subunit, expression of SnRK1 marker genes, and endogenous trehalose pathway genes were also altered. Furthermore, leaves of the transgenic maize maintained a higher photosynthetic rate for a longer period compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that decreasing T6P in reproductive tissues down-regulates primary metabolism and up-regulates secondary metabolism, resulting in different metabolite profiles in component tissues. Our data implicate T6P/ SnRK1 as a major regulator of whole-plant resource allocation for crop yield improvement.</p>

Identification of Phosphorylation Sites Altering Pollen Soluble Inorganic Pyrophosphatase Activity<xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Protein phosphorylation regulates numerous cellular processes. Identifying the substrates and protein kinases involved is vital to understand how these important posttranslational modifications modulate biological function in eukaryotic cells. Pyro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>ases catalyze the hydrolysis of inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (PP<sub>i</sub>) to inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e P<sub>i</sub>, driving biosynthetic reactions; they are essential for low cytosolic inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e. It was suggested recently that posttranslational regulation of Family I soluble inorganic pyro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>ases (sPPases) may affect their activity. We previously demonstrated that two pollen-expressed sPPases, Pr-p26.1a and Pr-p26.1b, from the flowering plant <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> were inhibited by phosphorylation. Despite the potential significance, there is a paucity of data on sPPase phosphorylation and regulation. Here, we used liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry to map phosphorylation sites to the otherwise divergent amino-terminal extensions on these pollen sPPases. Despite the absence of reports in the literature on mapping phosphorylation sites on sPPases, a database survey of various proteomes identified a number of examples, suggesting that phosphorylation may be a more widely used mechanism to regulate these enzymes. Phosphomimetic mutants of Pr-p26.1a/b significantly and differentially reduced PPase activities by up to 2.5-fold at pH 6.8 and 52% in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and hydrogen peroxide over unmodified proteins. This indicates that phosphoregulation of key sites can inhibit the catalytic responsiveness of these proteins in concert with key intracellular events. As sPPases are essential for many metabolic pathways in eukaryotic cells, our findings identify the phosphorylation of sPPases as a potential master regulatory mechanism that could be used to attenuate metabolism.</p>

Two h-Type Thioredoxins Interact with the E2 Ubiquitin Conjugase PHO2 to Fine-Tune Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice
<p><i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e overaccumulator2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>) encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme that is a major negative regulator of the inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (Pi)-starvation response-signaling pathway. A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; Os) using OsPHO2 as bait revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and two h-type thioredoxins, OsTrxh1 and OsTrxh4. These interactions were confirmed in vivo using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) of OsPHO2 and OsTrxh1/h4 in rice protoplasts and by in vitro pull-down assays with 6His-tagged OsTrxh1/h4 and GST-tagged OsPHO2. Y2H assays revealed that amino acid Cys-445 of OsPHO2 and an N-terminal Cys in the “WCGPC” motif of Trxhs were required for the interaction. Split-ubiquitin Y2H analyses and BiFC assays in rice protoplasts confirmed the interaction of OsPHO2 with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>E TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (OsPHF1), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>E1;2 (OsPHO1;2) in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membrane system, where OsPHO2 mediates the degradation of OsPHF1 in both tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and rice seedlings. Characterization of rice <i>pho2</i> complemented lines, transformed with an endogenous genomic <i>OsPHO2</i> or <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> (a constitutively reduced form) fragment, indicated that <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> restored Pi concentration in rice to statistically significant lower levels compared to native <i>OsPHO2</i>. Moreover, the suppression of <i>OsTrxh1</i> (knockdown and knockout) resulted in slightly higher Pi concentration than that of wild-type Nipponbare in leaves. These results demonstrate that OsPHO2 is under redox control by thioredoxins, which fine-tune its activity and link Pi homeostasis with redox balance in rice.</p>

Novel Adipokine, FAM19A5, Inhibits Neointima Formation After Injury Through Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 2
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Obesity plays crucial roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanisms that link obesity and cardiovascular diseases remain elusive. Compelling evidence indicates that adipokines play an important role in obesity-related cardiovascular diseases. Here, we found a new adipokine-named family with sequence similarity 19, member A5 (FAM19A5), a protein with unknown function that was predicted to be distantly related to the CC-chemokine family.

Accordingly, FAM19A5 silencing in adipocytes significantly promoted vascular smooth muscle cell activation. Adipose-specific FAM19A5 transgenic mice showed greater attenuation of neointima formation compared with wild-type littermates fed with or without Western-style diet.

Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate is a major source of GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide production

We previously found that stimulation of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in cardiac cells leads to the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>idylinositol 4-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (PI4P) at the Golgi, a process required for the activation of nuclear protein kinase D (PKD) during cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesized that GPCR-stimulated PLC activation leading to direct PI4P hydrolysis may be a general mechanism for DAG production. We measured GPCR activation–dependent changes in PM and Golgi PI4P pools in various cells using GFP-based detection of PI4P. Stimulation with various agonists caused a time-dependent reduction in PI4P-associated, but not PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>-associated, fluorescence at the Golgi and PM. Targeted depletion of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> from the PM before GPCR stimulation had no effect on the depletion of PM or Golgi PI4P, total inositol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (IP) production, or PKD activation. In contrast, acute depletion of PI4P specifically at the PM completely blocked the GPCR-dependent production of IPs and activation of PKD but did not change the abundance of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>. Acute depletion of Golgi PI4P had no effect on these processes. These data suggest that most of the PM PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> pool is not involved in GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that PI4P at the PM is responsible for the bulk of receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and DAG production.</p>

Mitochondrial redox sensing by the kinase ATM maintains cellular antioxidant capacity
<p>Mitochondria are integral to cellular energy metabolism and ATP production and are involved in regulating many cellular processes. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which not only can damage cellular components but also participate in signal transduction. The kinase ATM, which is mutated in the neurodegenerative, autosomal recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), is a key player in the nuclear DNA damage response. However, ATM also performs a redox-sensing function mediated through formation of ROS-dependent disulfide-linked dimers. We found that mitochondria-derived hydrogen peroxide promoted ATM dimerization. In HeLa cells, ATM dimers were localized to the nucleus and inhibited by the redox regulatory protein thioredoxin 1 (TRX1), suggesting the existence of a ROS-mediated, stress-signaling relay from mitochondria to the nucleus. ATM dimer formation did not affect its association with chromatin in the absence or presence of nuclear DNA damage, consistent with the separation of its redox and DNA damage signaling functions. Comparative analysis of U2OS cells expressing either wild-type ATM or the redox sensing–deficient C2991L mutant revealed that one function of ATM redox sensing is to promote glucose flux through the pentose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e pathway (PPP) by increasing the abundance and activity of glucose-6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e dehydrogenase (G6PD), thereby increasing cellular antioxidant capacity. The PPP produces the coenzyme NADPH needed for a robust antioxidant response, including the regeneration of TRX1, indicating the existence of a regulatory feedback loop involving ATM and TRX1. We propose that loss of the mitochondrial ROS-sensing function of ATM may cause cellular ROS accumulation and oxidative stress in A-T.</p>

Structural insight into precursor tRNA processing by yeast ribonuclease P
<p>Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a universal ribozyme responsible for processing the 5′-leader of pre–transfer RNA (pre-tRNA). Here, we report the 3.5-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structures of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> RNase P alone and in complex with pre-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>. The protein components form a hook-shaped architecture that wraps around the RNA and stabilizes RNase P into a “measuring device” with two fixed anchors that recognize the L-shaped pre-tRNA. A universally conserved uridine nucleobase and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e backbone in the catalytic center together with the scissile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e and the O3′ leaving group of pre-tRNA jointly coordinate two catalytic magnesium ions. Binding of pre-tRNA induces a conformational change in the catalytic center that is required for catalysis. Moreover, simulation analysis suggests a two-metal-ion S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction pathway of pre-tRNA cleavage. These results not only reveal the architecture of yeast RNase P but also provide a molecular basis of how the 5′-leader of pre-tRNA is processed by eukaryotic RNase P.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation, and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes
<p>Plant roots rely on inorganic ortho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (Pi) transporters to acquire soluble Pi from soil solutions that exists at micromolar levels in natural ecosystems. Here, we functionally characterized a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) Pi transporter, Os <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e Transporter-1;3 (OsPHT1;3), that mediates Pi uptake, translocation, and remobilization. <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was directly regulated by Os <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e Starvation Response-2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades. OsPHT1;3 was able to complement a yeast mutant strain defective in five Pi transporters and mediate Pi influx in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. Overexpression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots. However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members that facilitate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation only when external Pi concentration was below 5 μ<sc>m</sc>. Moreover, in basal nodes, the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was restricted to the phloem of regular vascular bundles and enlarged vascular bundles. An isotope labeling experiment with <sup>32</sup>P showed that <i>ospht1</i>;<i>3</i> mutant lines were impaired in remobilization of Pi from source to sink leaves. Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>2</i> and several other <i>OsPHT1</i> genes. Yeast-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated a physical interaction between OsPHT1;3 and OsPHT1;2. Taken together, our results indicate that OsPHT1;3 acts as a crucial factor for Pi acquisition, root-to-shoot Pi translocation, and redistribution of phosphorus in plants growing in environments with extremely low Pi levels.</p>

Genetic Dissection of Fe-Dependent Signaling in Root Developmental Responses to Phosphate Deficiency
<p>The inhibition of primary root (PR) growth is a major developmental response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (Pi) deficiency. Previous studies have independently uncovered key roles of the LOW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>E RESPONSE1 (LPR1) ferroxidase, the tonoplast-localized ALUMINUM SENSITIVE3 (ALS3)/SENSITIVE TO ALUMINUM RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STAR1) transporter complex, and the SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1; a transcription factor)-ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (ALMT1; a malate transporter) regulatory module in mediating this response by controlling iron (Fe) homeostasis in roots, but how these three components interact to regulate PR growth under Pi deficiency remains unknown. Here, we dissected genetic relationships among these three key components and found that (1) STOP1, ALMT1, and LPR1 act downstream of ALS3/STAR1 in controlling PR growth under Pi deficiency; (2) ALS3/STAR1 inhibits the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway by repressing STOP1 protein accumulation in the nucleus; and (3) STOP1-ALMT1 and LPR1 control PR growth under Pi deficiency in an interdependent manner involving the promotion of malate-dependent Fe accumulation in roots. Furthermore, this malate-mediated Fe accumulation depends on external Pi availability. We also performed a detailed analysis of the dynamic changes in the tissue-specific Fe accumulation patterns in the root tips of plants exposed to Pi deficiency. The results indicate that the degree of inhibition of PR growth induced by Pi deficiency is not linked to the level of Fe accumulated in the root apical meristem or the elongation zone. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism that regulates the root developmental response to Pi deficiency.</p>

A Cytosolic Triosephosphate Isomerase Is a Key Component in XA3/XA26-Mediated Resistance
<p>Bacterial blight caused by <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>) causes severe damage to rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide. The major disease resistance gene, <i>Xa3/Xa26</i>, confers broad-spectrum and durable resistance to <i>Xoo</i> at both seedling and adult stages. However, the molecular mechanism of the <i>Xa3/Xa26</i>-initiated defense pathway against <i>Xoo</i> is still largely unknown. Here, we show that a triose<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e isomerase (TPI), OsTPI1.1, is a key component in XA3/XA26-mediated resistance to <i>Xoo</i>. OsTPI1.1 is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of dihydroxyacetone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e to glyceraldehyde-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e. Transcriptional suppression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> in plants harboring <i>Xa3/Xa26</i> largely impaired the XA3/XA26-mediated resistance to <i>Xoo</i>, and constitutive overexpression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> in susceptible rice plants without <i>Xa3/Xa26</i> only slightly decreased the susceptibility to <i>Xoo</i>. Therefore, both XA3/XA26 and OsTPI1.1 are required in XA3/XA26-mediated resistance. We show that OsTPI1.1 participates in the resistance through its enzymatic activity, which was enhanced significantly by its binding with XA3/XA26. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydrogen peroxide, accumulated in the OsTPI1.1-overexpressing plants, and suppression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> decreased ROS accumulation. The changes in ROS are associated with the reduction of NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH, which may act as a redox cofactor to scavenge ROS, leading to reduced resistance to <i>Xoo</i>. These results suggest that OsTPI1.1 modulates ROS production as a resistance mechanism against <i>Xoo</i>.</p>

Growth at Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Requires Acclimation of the Respiratory Chain to Support Photosynthesis
<p>Plants will experience an elevated atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (ECO<sub>2</sub>) in the future. Growth of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) at ECO<sub>2</sub> more than doubled the leaf protein amount of alternative oxidase (AOX), a non-energy-conserving component of mitochondrial respiration. To test the functional significance of this AOX increase, wild-type tobacco was compared with AOX knockdown and overexpression lines, following growth at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or ECO<sub>2</sub>. The ECO<sub>2</sub>-grown AOX knockdowns had a reduced capacity for triose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e use (TPU) during photosynthesis compared with the other plant lines. This TPU limitation of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation was associated with an increased accumulation of glucose-6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e, sucrose, and starch in the leaves of the knockdowns. Under TPU-limiting conditions, the size of the proton gradient and proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane was enhanced in the knockdowns relative to the other plant lines, suggesting a restriction of chloroplast ATP synthase activity. This restriction was not due to a decline in ATP synthase (AtpB) protein amount. The knockdowns also displayed a photosystem stoichiometry adjustment at ECO<sub>2</sub>, which was absent in the other plant lines. Additional experiments showed that the way in which AOX supports photosynthesis at ECO<sub>2</sub> is distinct from its previously described role in supporting photosynthesis during water deficit. The results are discussed in terms of how AOX contributes to TPU capacity and the maintenance of chloroplast ATP synthase activity at ECO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the evidence suggests that AOX respiration is needed to maintain both the carbon and energy balance in photosynthetic tissues during growth at ECO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

The ARF7 and ARF19 Transcription Factors Positively Regulate <i>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> in Arabidopsis Roots
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>E STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) is a key regulatory component of the response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (Pi) starvation. However, the regulation of <i>PHR1</i> in this response remains poorly understood. Here, we report that <i>PHR1</i> is a target of the transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 and is positively regulated by auxin signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots. <i>PHR1</i> expression was induced by exogenous auxin and suppressed by auxin transport inhibitors in Arabidopsis roots. In the <i>PHR1</i> promoter, three auxin-response elements, which are bound directly by ARF7 and ARF19, were shown to be essential for <i>PHR1</i> expression. The <i>arf7</i>, <i>arf19</i>, and <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutants showed down-regulated expression of <i>PHR1</i> and downstream Pi starvation-induced genes in roots; they also exhibited defective Pi uptake in roots and overaccumulation of anthocyanin in shoots. The induction of lateral root formation in response to low Pi and to exogenous auxin was decreased in the <i>phr1</i> mutant, whereas the expression of <i>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN16</i> (<i>LBD16</i>) and <i>LBD29</i> was not changed significantly. PHR1 acted independently of LBD16 and LBD29 in the regulation of lateral root formation in response to low Pi. Under low-Pi conditions, lateral root impairment in the <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutant was partially rescued by constitutive expression of <i>PHR1</i>, demonstrating that reduced <i>PHR1</i> expression contributed to the <i>arf7 arf19</i> phenotype. In addition to <i>PHR1</i>, other genes encoding MYB-CC members also were targets of ARF7 and ARF19. Our work thus reveals a mechanism coordinating auxin signaling and the PHR1 regulon in Arabidopsis responses to Pi deficiency.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

Betaine Lipid Is Crucial for Adapting to Low Temperature and Phosphate Deficiency in <i>Nannochloropsis</i>
<p>Diacylglyceryl-<i>N,N,N</i>-trimethylhomo-Ser (DGTS) is a nonphosphorous, polar glycerolipid that is regarded as analogous to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>idylcholine in bacteria, fungi, algae, and basal land plants. In some species of algae, including the stramenopile microalga <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i>, DGTS contains an abundance of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is relatively scarce in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>idylcholine, implying that DGTS has a unique physiological role. In this study, we addressed the role of DGTS in <i>N. oceanica</i>. We identified two DGTS biosynthetic enzymes that have distinct domain configurations compared to previously identified DGTS synthases. Mutants lacking DGTS showed growth retardation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation, demonstrating a pivotal role for DGTS in the adaptation to this condition. Under normal conditions, DGTS deficiency led to an increase in the relative amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, a major plastid membrane lipid with high EPA content, whereas excessive production of DGTS induced by gene overexpression led to a decrease in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. Meanwhile, lipid analysis of partial phospholipid-deficient mutants revealed a role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>idylcholine and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>idylethanolamine in EPA biosynthesis. These results suggest that DGTS and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol may constitute the two major pools of EPA in extraplastidic and plastidic membranes, partially competing to acquire EPA or its precursors derived from phospholipids. The mutant lacking DGTS also displayed impaired growth and a lower proportion of EPA in extraplastidic compartments at low temperatures. Our results indicate that DGTS is involved in the adaptation to low temperatures through a mechanism that is distinct from the DGTS-dependent adaptation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation in <i>N. oceanica</i>.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

TransDetect Identifies a New Regulatory Module Controlling Phosphate Accumulation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Identifying transcription factor (TFs) cooperation controlling target gene expression is still an arduous challenge.

This demonstrates the potential of TransDetect to extract directionality in nondynamic transcriptomes and to provide a blueprint to identify gene regulatory network involved in a given biological process.</p>

<i>Small kernel2</i> Encodes a Glutaminase in Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis Essential for Maize Seed Development
<p>Vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, an essential cofactor for a range of biochemical reactions and a potent antioxidant, plays important roles in plant growth, development, and stress tolerance. Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> deficiency causes embryo lethality in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but the specific role of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis in endosperm development has not been fully addressed, especially in monocot crops, where endosperm constitutes the major portion of the grain. Through molecular characterization of a <i>small kernel2</i> (<i>smk2</i>) mutant in maize, we reveal that vitamin B<sub>6</sub> has differential effects on embryogenesis and endosperm development in maize. The B<sub>6</sub> vitamer pyridoxal 5′-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (PLP) is drastically reduced in both the <i>smk2</i> embryo and the endosperm. However, whereas embryogenesis of the <i>smk2</i> mutant is arrested at the transition stage, endosperm formation is nearly normal. Cloning reveals that <i>Smk2</i> encodes the glutaminase subunit of the PLP synthase complex involved in vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis de novo. <i>Smk2</i> partially complements the Arabidopsis vitamin B<sub>6</sub>-deficient mutant <i>pdx2.1</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> pyridoxine auxotrophic mutant MML21. <i>Smk2</i> is constitutively expressed in the maize plant, including developing embryos. Analysis of B<sub>6</sub> vitamers indicates that the endosperm accumulates a large amount of pyridoxamine 5′-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (PMP). These results indicate that vitamin B<sub>6</sub> is essential to embryogenesis but has a reduced role in endosperm development in maize. The vitamin B<sub>6</sub> required for seed development is synthesized in the seed, and the endosperm accumulates PMP probably as a storage form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>.</p>

A Comprehensive Expression Profile of MicroRNAs and Other Classes of Non-Coding Small RNAs in Barley Under Phosphorous-Deficient and -Sufficient Conditions
<p>Phosphorus (P) is essential for plant growth. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e homeostasis. However, little is known about P effect on miRNA expression in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). In this study, we used Illumina's next-generation sequencing technology to sequence small RNAs (sRNAs) in barley grown under P-deficient and P-sufficient conditions. We identified 221 conserved miRNAs and 12 novel miRNAs, of which 55 were only present in P-deficient treatment while 32 only existed in P-sufficient treatment. Total 47 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between the two P treatments (|log<sub>2</sub>| > 1). We also identified many other classes of sRNAs, including sense and antisense sRNAs, repeat-associated sRNAs, transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived sRNAs and chloroplast-derived sRNAs, and some of which were also significantly differentially expressed between the two P treatments. Of all the sRNAs identified, antisense sRNAs were the most abundant sRNA class in both P treatments. Surprisingly, about one-fourth of sRNAs were derived from the chloroplast genome, and a chloroplast-encoded tRNA-derived sRNA was the most abundant sRNA of all the sRNAs sequenced. Our data provide valuable clues for understanding the properties of sRNAs and new insights into the potential roles of miRNAs and other classes of sRNAs in the control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e homeostasis.</p>

Sterilizing immunity in the lung relies on targeting fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death
<p>Humans inhale mold conidia daily and typically experience lifelong asymptomatic clearance. Conidial germination into tissue-invasive hyphae can occur in individuals with defects in myeloid function, although the mechanism of myeloid cell–mediated immune surveillance remains unclear. By monitoring fungal physiology in vivo, we demonstrate that lung neutrophils trigger programmed cell death with apoptosis-like features in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia, the most prevalent human mold pathogen. An antiapoptotic protein, AfBIR1, opposes this process by inhibiting fungal caspase activation and DNA fragmentation in the murine lung. Genetic and pharmacologic studies indicate that AfBIR1 expression and activity underlie conidial susceptibility to NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e) oxidase-dependent killing and, in turn, host susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis.

Fatty acids in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are synthesized by the host plant

Lipids are transferred from the plant to mycorrhizal fungi, which are fatty acid auxotrophs, and this lipid export requires the glycerol-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e acyltransferase RAM2, a direct target of RAM1.

Hawkmoths use nectar sugar to reduce oxidative damage from flight

We found that sugar-fed moths had lower oxidative damage to their flight muscle membranes than unfed moths. Using respirometry coupled with δ<sup>13</sup>C analyses, we showed that moths generate antioxidant potential by shunting nectar glucose to the pentose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e pathway (PPP), resulting in a reduction in oxidative damage to the flight muscles.

A MYB Triad Controls Primary and Phenylpropanoid Metabolites for Pollen Coat Patterning
<p>The pollen wall is a complex, durable structure essential for plant reproduction. A substantial portion of phenylpropanoids (e.g. flavonols) produced by pollen grain tapetal cells are deposited in the pollen wall. Transcriptional regulation of pollen wall formation has been studied extensively, and a specific regulatory mechanism for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) pollen flavonol biosynthesis has been postulated. Here, metabolome and transcriptome analyses of anthers from mutant and overexpression genotypes revealed that Arabidopsis MYB99, a putative ortholog of the petunia (<i>Petunia hybrida</i>) floral scent regulator ODORANT1 (ODO1), controls the exclusive production of tapetum diglycosylated flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid amides. We discovered that MYB99 acts in a regulatory triad with MYB21 and MYB24, orthologs of emission of benzenoids I and II, which together with ODO1 coregulate petunia scent biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, promoter-activation assays showed that MYB99 directs precursor supply from the Calvin cycle and oxidative pentose-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e pathway in primary metabolism to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis by controlling <i>TRANSKETOLASE2</i> expression. We provide a model depicting the relationship between the Arabidopsis MYB triad and structural genes from primary and phenylpropanoid metabolism and compare this mechanism with petunia scent control. The discovery of orthologous protein triads producing related secondary metabolites suggests that analogous regulatory modules exist in other plants and act to regulate various branches of the intricate phenylpropanoid pathway.</p>

The Potassium Transporter SlHAK10 Is Involved in Mycorrhizal Potassium Uptake
<p>Most terrestrial plants form a root symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which receive fixed carbon from the plant and enhance the plant’s uptake of mineral nutrients. AM symbiosis improves the phosphorous and nitrogen nutrition of host plants; however, little is known about the role of AM symbiosis in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) nutrition. Here, we report that inoculation with the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> improved tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plant growth and K<sup>+</sup> acquisition and that K<sup>+</sup> deficiency has a negative effect on root growth and AM colonization. Based on its homology to a <i>Lotus japonicus</i> AM-induced K<sup>+</sup> transporter, we identified a mycorrhiza-specific tomato K<sup>+</sup> transporter, SlHAK10 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum High-affinity Potassium Transporter10</i>), that was exclusively expressed in arbuscule-containing cells. <i>SlHAK10</i> could restore a yeast K<sup>+</sup> uptake-defective mutant in the low-affinity concentration range. Loss of function of <i>SlHAK10</i> led to a significant decrease in mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake and AM colonization rate under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions but did not affect arbuscule development. Overexpressing <i>SlHAK10</i> from the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the AM-specific <i>Solanum melongena Phosphate Transporter4</i> not only improved plant growth and K<sup>+</sup> uptake but also increased AM colonization efficiency and soluble sugar content in roots supplied with low K<sup>+</sup>. Our results indicate that tomato plants have a SlHAK10<i>-</i>mediated mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake pathway and that improved plant K<sup>+</sup> nutrition could increase carbohydrate accumulation in roots, which facilitates AM fungal colonization.</p>

Ca<sup>2+</sup> is known to signal in root development and adaptation but has to be tightly controlled, as it is highly toxic to Pi metabolism. Under Pi starvation and the resulting decreased cellular Pi pool, the use of cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) as a signal transducer may therefore have to be altered. Employing aequorin-expressing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we show that Pi starvation, but not nitrogen starvation, strongly dampens the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> increases evoked by mechanical, salt, osmotic, and oxidative stress as well as by extracellular nucleotides. The altered root [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response to extracellular ATP manifests during seedling development under chronic Pi deprivation but can be reversed by Pi resupply. Employing ratiometric imaging, we delineate that Pi-starved roots have a normal response to extracellular ATP at the apex but show a strongly dampened [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response in distal parts of the root tip, correlating with high reactive oxygen species levels induced by Pi starvation. Excluding iron, as well as Pi, rescues this altered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response and restores reactive oxygen species levels to those seen under nutrient-replete conditions. These results indicate that, while Pi availability does not seem to be signaled through [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>, Pi starvation strongly affects stress-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> signatures. These data reveal how plants can integrate nutritional and environmental cues, adding another layer of complexity to the use of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a signal transducer.</p>

SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT Functions in Isoprenoid Biosynthesis via the Plastid MEP Pathway
<p>Plastid isoprenoids, a diverse group of compounds that includes carotenoids, chlorophylls, tocopherols, and multiple hormones, are essential for plant growth and development. Here, we identified and characterized <i>SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT</i> (<i>SCD</i>), which encodes an enzyme that functions in the biosynthesis of plastid isoprenoids in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). SCD converts 2<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erytrithol 2,4-cyclodi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e to 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e in the penultimate step of the methylerythritol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (MEP) pathway. In <i>scd</i> mutants, plant growth and development are impaired and the levels of MEP-derived isoprenoids, such as carotenoids, chlorophylls, and tocopherols, as well as abscisic and gibberellic acids, are reduced in leaves and seeds. This <i>scd</i> metabolic alteration varies among plant tissues and under different light conditions. RNA-sequencing of the <i>scd</i> mutant and wild type identified a limited number of differentially expressed genes in the MEP pathway, although isoprenoid levels were significantly reduced in <i>scd</i> seeds and dark-grown leaves. Furthermore, <i>SCD</i>-overexpressing transgenic lines showed little or no differences in isoprenoid levels, indicating that SCD may be subject to posttranslational regulation or not represent a rate-limiting step in the MEP pathway. These results enhance our understanding of the transcriptomic and metabolic regulatory roles of enzymes in the MEP pathway and of their effects on downstream isoprenoid pathways in various plant tissues and under different light conditions.</p>

Vacuolar Phosphate Transporters Contribute to Systemic Phosphate Homeostasis Vital for Reproductive Development in Arabidopsis
<p>Vacuolar storage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (Pi) is essential for Pi homeostasis in plants. Recent studies have identified a family of vacuolar Pi transporters, VPTs (PHT5s), responsible for vacuolar sequestration of Pi. We report here that both VPT1 and VPT3 contribute to cytosol-to-vacuole Pi partitioning. Although VPT1 plays a predominant role, VPT3 is particularly important when VPT1 is absent. Our data suggested that the <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> double mutant was more defective in Pi homeostasis than the <i>vpt1</i> single mutant, as indicated by Pi accumulation capacity, vacuolar Pi influx, subcellular Pi allocation, and plant adaptability to changing Pi status. The remaining member of the VPT family, VPT2 (PHT5;2), did not appear to contribute to Pi homeostasis in such assays. Particularly interesting is the finding that the <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> double mutant was impaired in reproductive development with shortened siliques and impaired seed set under sufficient Pi, and this phenotype was not found in the <i>vpt1 vpt2</i> and <i>vpt2 vpt3</i> double mutants. Measurements of Pi contents revealed Pi over-accumulation in the floral organs of <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> as compared with the wild type. Further analysis identified excess Pi in the pistil as inhibitory to pollen tube growth, and thus seed yield, in the mutant plants. Reducing the Pi levels in culture medium or mutation of PHO1, a Pi transport protein responsible for root-shoot transport, restored the seed set of <i>vpt1 vpt3</i>. Thus, VPTs, through their function in vacuolar Pi sequestration, control the fine-tuning of systemic Pi allocation, which is particularly important for reproductive development.</p>

An Aromatic Farnesyltransferase Functions in Biosynthesis of the Anti-HIV Meroterpenoid Daurichromenic Acid
<p><i>Rhododendron dauricum</i> produces daurichromenic acid, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid, via oxidative cyclization of the farnesyl group of grifolic acid. The prenyltransferase (PT) that synthesizes grifolic acid is a farnesyltransferase in plant specialized metabolism. In this study, we demonstrated that the isoprenoid moiety of grifolic acid is derived from the 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol-4-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e pathway that takes place in plastids. We explored candidate sequences of plastid-localized PT homologs and identified a cDNA for this PT, RdPT1, which shares moderate sequence similarity with known aromatic PTs. RdPT1 is expressed exclusively in the glandular scales, where daurichromenic acid accumulates. In addition, the gene product was targeted to plastids in plant cells. The recombinant RdPT1 regiospecifically synthesized grifolic acid from orsellinic acid and farnesyl di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e, demonstrating that RdPT1 is the farnesyltransferase involved in daurichromenic acid biosynthesis. This enzyme strictly preferred orsellinic acid as a prenyl acceptor, whereas it had a relaxed specificity for prenyl donor structures, also accepting geranyl and geranylgeranyl di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>es with modest efficiency to synthesize prenyl chain analogs of grifolic acid. Such a broad specificity is a unique catalytic feature of RdPT1 that is not shared among secondary metabolic aromatic PTs in plants. We discuss the unusual substrate preference of RdPT1 using a molecular modeling approach. The biochemical properties as well as the localization of RdPT1 suggest that this enzyme produces meroterpenoids in glandular scales cooperatively with previously identified daurichromenic acid synthase, probably for chemical defense on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants.</p>

The <i>PILNCR1</i>-miR399 Regulatory Module Is Important for Low Phosphate Tolerance in Maize
<p>The regulation of adaptive responses to phosphorus (P) deficiency by the <i>microRNA399</i> (<i>miR399</i>)/<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>E2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>) pathway has been well studied in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) but not in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Here, we show that miR399 transcripts are strongly induced in maize by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (Pi) deficiency. Transgenic maize plants that overexpressed <i>MIR399b</i> accumulated excessive amounts of P in their shoots and displayed typical Pi-toxicity phenotypes. We reannotated <i>ZmPHO2</i> with an additional 1,165 bp of the 5′ untranslated region. miR399-guided posttranscriptional repression of <i>ZmPHO2</i> was mainly observed in the P-efficient lines. We identified Pi-deficiency-induced long-noncoding RNA1 (<i>PILNCR1</i>) from our strand-specific RNA libraries. Transient expression assays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize leaf protoplasts demonstrated that <i>PILNCR1</i> inhibits ZmmiR399-guided cleavage of <i>ZmPHO2</i>. The abundance of <i>PILNCR1</i> was significantly higher in P-inefficient lines than in P-efficient lines, which is consistent with the abundance of ZmmiR399 transcripts. These results indicate that the interaction between <i>PILNCR1</i> and miR399 is important for tolerance to low Pi in maize.</p>

3′-Phosphoadenosine 5′-Phosphate Accumulation Delays the Circadian System
<p>The circadian system optimizes cellular responses to stress, but the signaling pathways that convey the metabolic consequences of stress into this molecular timekeeping mechanism remain unclear. Redox regulation of the SAL1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>ase during abiotic stress initiates a signaling pathway from chloroplast to nucleus by regulating the accumulation of a metabolite, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (PAP). Consequently, PAP accumulates in response to redox stress and inhibits the activity of exoribonucleases (XRNs) in the nucleus and cytosol. We demonstrated that osmotic stress induces a lengthening of circadian period and that genetically inducing the SAL1-PAP-XRN pathway in plants lacking either SAL1 or XRNs similarly delays the circadian system. Exogenous application of PAP was also sufficient to extend circadian period. Thus, SAL1-PAP-XRN signaling likely regulates circadian rhythms in response to redox stress. Our findings exemplify how two central processes in plants, molecular timekeeping and responses to abiotic stress, can be interlinked to regulate gene expression.</p>

STRESS INDUCED FACTOR 2, a Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase Regulates Basal Plant Pathogen Defense
<p>Protein kinases play fundamental roles in plant development and environmental stress responses. Here, we identified the <i>STRESS INDUCED FACTOR</i> (<i>SIF</i>) gene family, which encodes four leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinases in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The four genes, <i>SIF1</i> to <i>SIF4</i>, are clustered in the genome and highly conserved, but they have temporally and spatially distinct expression patterns. We employed Arabidopsis <i>SIF</i> knockout mutants and overexpression transgenics to examine SIF involvement during plant pathogen defense. <i>SIF</i> genes are rapidly induced by biotic or abiotic stresses, and SIF proteins localize to the plasma membrane. Simultaneous knockout of <i>SIF1</i> and <i>SIF2</i> led to improved plant salt tolerance, whereas <i>SIF2</i> overexpression enhanced PAMP-triggered immunity and prompted basal plant defenses, significantly improving pathogen resistance. Furthermore, <i>SIF2</i> overexpression plants exhibited up-regulated expression of the defense-related genes <i>WRKY53</i> and <i>flg22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> as well as enhanced MPK3/MPK6 phosphorylation upon pathogen and elicitor treatments. The expression of the calcium signaling-related gene <i>PHOSPHATE-INDUCED1</i> also was enhanced in the <i>SIF2</i>-overexpressing lines upon pathogen inoculation but repressed in the <i>sif2</i> mutants. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation demonstrates that the BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1 protein is a coreceptor of the SIF2 kinase in the signal transduction pathway during pathogen invasion. These findings characterize a stress-responsive protein kinase family and illustrate how SIF2 modulates signal transduction for effective plant pathogenic defense.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into chromosomes. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

The Deubiquitinase OTU5 Regulates Root Responses to Phosphate Starvation
<p>Phosphorus, taken up by plants as inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (Pi), is an essential but often growth-limiting mineral nutrient for plants. As part of an orchestrated response to improve its acquisition, insufficient Pi supply triggers alterations in root architecture and epidermal cell morphogenesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants defective in the expression of the <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) exhibited a constitutive Pi deficiency root phenotype, comprising the formation of long and dense root hairs and attenuated primary root growth. Quantitative protein profiling of <i>otu5</i> and wild-type roots using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification methodology revealed genotype- and Pi-dependent alterations in protein profiles. In <i>otu5</i> plants, Pi starvation caused a short-root-hair phenotype and decreased abundance of a suite of Pi-responsive root hair-related proteins. Mutant plants also showed the accumulation of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and altered distribution of reactive oxygen species along the root, which may be causative for the alterations in root hair morphogenesis. The root hair phenotype of <i>otu5</i> was synergistic to that of <i>actin-related protein6</i> (<i>arp6</i>), harboring a mutation in the SWR1 chromatin-remodeling complex. Genetic analysis of <i>otu5/arp6</i> double mutants suggests independent but functionally related roles of the two proteins in chromatin organization. The root hair phenotype of <i>otu5</i> is not caused by a general up-regulation of the Pi starvation response, indicating that OTU5 acts downstream of or interacts with Pi signaling. It is concluded that OTU5 is involved in the interpretation of environmental information, probably by altering chromatin organization and maintaining redox homeostasis.</p>

Phosphoglycerate Kinases Are Co-Regulated to Adjust Metabolism and to Optimize Growth
<p>In plants, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) converts 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate into 3-phosphoglycerate in glycolysis but also participates in the reverse reaction in gluconeogenesis and the Calvin-Benson cycle. In the databases, we found three genes that encode putative PGKs. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PGK1 was localized exclusively in the chloroplasts of photosynthetic tissues, while PGK2 was expressed in the chloroplast/plastid of photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic cells. PGK3 was expressed ubiquitously in the cytosol of all studied cell types. Measurements of carbohydrate content and photosynthetic activities in PGK mutants and silenced lines corroborated that PGK1 was the photosynthetic isoform, while PGK2 and PGK3 were the plastidial and cytosolic glycolytic isoforms, respectively. The <i>pgk1.1</i> knockdown mutant displayed reduced growth, lower photosynthetic capacity, and starch content. The <i>pgk3.2</i> knockout mutant was characterized by reduced growth but higher starch levels than the wild type. The <i>pgk1.1 pgk3.2</i> double mutant was bigger than <i>pgk3.2</i> and displayed an intermediate phenotype between the two single mutants in all measured biochemical and physiological parameters. Expression studies in <i>PGK</i> mutants showed that <i>PGK1</i> and <i>PGK3</i> were down-regulated in <i>pgk3.2</i> and <i>pgk1.1</i>, respectively. These results indicate that the down-regulation of photosynthetic activity could be a plant strategy when glycolysis is impaired to achieve metabolic adjustment and optimize growth. The double mutants of <i>PGK3</i> and the triose-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e transporter (<i>pgk3.2 tpt3)</i> displayed a drastic growth phenotype, but they were viable. This implies that other enzymes or nonspecific chloroplast transporters could provide 3-phosphoglycerate to the cytosol. Our results highlight both the complexity and the plasticity of the plant primary metabolic network.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Deubiquitinating Enzyme OTU5 Contributes to DNA Methylation Patterns and Is Critical for Phosphate Nutrition Signals
<p>Phosphate (Pi) starvation induces a suite of adaptive responses aimed at recalibrating cellular Pi homeostasis. Plants harboring a mutation in <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) showed altered DNA methylation of root hair-related genes and altered Pi-responsive root traits. Unlike the wild type, homozygous <i>otu5</i> mutants did not respond to Pi starvation by increased lateral root formation and increased root hair length but formed very short root hairs when grown on low-Pi media. Under Pi-replete conditions, <i>otu5</i> plants developed more root hairs than the wild type due to attenuated primary root growth, a phenotype that resembled that of Pi-deficient plants. Growth of plants on low-Pi media altered both H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation levels at the transcriptional start site of a subset of genes encoding key players in Pi homeostasis, which was correlated with mRNA abundance changes of these genes. Pi starvation had a minor impact on DNA methylation. Differentially methylated regions were enriched in transposable elements, suggesting that DNA methylation associated with low Pi supply is required for maintaining genome integrity. It is concluded that DNA methylation and histone methylation constitute critical, interdependent regulatory components that orchestrate the activity of a subset of Pi-responsive genes.</p>

SIPP, a Novel Mitochondrial Phosphate Carrier, Mediates in Self-Incompatibility
<p>In Solanaceae, the <i>S</i>-specific interaction between the pistil S-RNase and the pollen <i>S</i>-Locus F-box protein controls self-incompatibility (SI). Although this interaction defines the specificity of the pollen rejection response, the identification of three pistil essential modifier genes unlinked to the <i>S</i>-locus (<i>HT-B</i>, <i>120K</i>, and <i>NaStEP</i>) unveils a higher degree of complexity in the pollen rejection pathway. We showed previously that NaStEP, a stigma protein with homology with Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, is essential to SI in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. During pollination, NaStEP is taken up by pollen tubes, where potential interactions with pollen tube proteins might underlie its function. Here, we identified NaSIPP, a mitochondrial protein with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e transporter activity, as a novel NaStEP-interacting protein. Coexpression of NaStEP and NaSIPP in pollen tubes showed interaction in the mitochondria, although when expressed alone, NaStEP remains mostly cytosolic, implicating NaSIPP-mediated translocation of NaStEP into the organelle. The <i>NaSIPP</i> transcript is detected specifically in mature pollen of <i>Nicotiana</i> spp.; however, in self-compatible plants, this gene has accumulated mutations, so its coding region is unlikely to produce a functional protein. RNA interference suppression of NaSIPP in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. pollen grains disrupts the SI by preventing pollen tube inhibition. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model whereby the NaStEP and NaSIPP interaction, in incompatible pollen tubes, might destabilize the mitochondria and contribute to arrest pollen tube growth.</p>

Enhanced Secondary- and Hormone Metabolism in Leaves of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal <i>Medicago truncatula</i>
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are the most common symbiotic associations between a plant’s root compartment and fungi. They provide nutritional benefit (mostly inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e [P<sub>i</sub>]), leading to improved growth, and nonnutritional benefits, including defense responses to environmental cues throughout the host plant, which, in return, delivers carbohydrates to the symbiont. However, how transcriptional and metabolic changes occurring in leaves of AM plants differ from those induced by P<sub>i</sub> fertilization is poorly understood. We investigated systemic changes in the leaves of mycorrhized <i>Medicago truncatula</i> in conditions with no improved P<sub>i</sub> status and compared them with those induced by high-P<sub>i</sub> treatment in nonmycorrhized plants. Microarray-based genome-wide profiling indicated up-regulation by mycorrhization of genes involved in flavonoid, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis as well as enhanced expression of <i>MYC2</i>, the master regulator of JA-dependent responses. Accordingly, total anthocyanins and flavonoids increased, and most flavonoid species were enriched in AM leaves. Both the AM and P<sub>i</sub> treatments corepressed iron homeostasis genes, resulting in lower levels of available iron in leaves. In addition, higher levels of cytokinins were found in leaves of AM- and P<sub>i</sub>-treated plants, whereas the level of ABA was increased specifically in AM leaves. Foliar treatment of nonmycorrhized plants with either ABA or JA induced the up-regulation of <i>MYC2</i>, but only JA also induced the up-regulation of flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthetic genes. Based on these results, we propose that mycorrhization and P<sub>i</sub> fertilization share cytokinin-mediated improved shoot growth, whereas enhanced ABA biosynthesis and JA-regulated flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthesis in leaves are specific to mycorrhization.</p>

Two Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases from <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Have Distinct Roles in Lipid Metabolism
<p>The metabolism of glycerol-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (G3P) is important for environmental stress responses by eukaryotic microalgae. G3P is an essential precursor for glycerolipid synthesis and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in response to nutrient starvation. G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH) mediates G3P synthesis, but the roles of specific GPDH isoforms are currently poorly understood. Of the five GPDH enzymes in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> were shown to be induced by nutrient starvation and/or salt stress. Heterologous expression of GPD2, a putative chloroplastic GPDH, and GPD3, a putative cytosolic GPDH, in a yeast <i>gpd1</i>Δ mutant demonstrated the functionality of both enzymes. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> knockdown mutants for <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> showed no difference in growth but displayed significant reduction in TAG concentration compared with the wild type in response to phosphorus or nitrogen starvation. Overexpression of <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> gave distinct phenotypes. <i>GPD2</i> overexpression lines showed only subtle metabolic phenotypes and no significant alteration in growth. In contrast, <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines displayed significantly inhibited growth and chlorophyll concentration, reduced glycerol concentration, and changes to lipid composition compared with the wild type, including increased abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>idic acids but reduced abundance of diglycerides, triglycerides, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>idylglycerol lipids. This may indicate a block in the downstream glycerolipid metabolism pathway in <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines. Thus, lipid engineering by GPDH modification may depend on the activities of other downstream enzyme steps. These results also suggest that GPD2 and GPD3 GPDH isoforms are important for nutrient starvation-induced TAG accumulation but have distinct metabolic functions.</p>

Identification and Metabolite Profiling of Chemical Activators of Lipid Accumulation in Green Algae
<p>Microalgae are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing biofuels and coproducts. However, several limitations must be overcome before algae-based production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce lipid accumulation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this barrier, a chemical genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 compounds were screened against <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, and 243 compounds were identified that increase triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation without terminating growth. Identified compounds were classified by structural similarity, and 15 were selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth fitness, photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch concentrations. TAG accumulation was verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification of total fatty acids, and targeted TAG and galactolipid measurements were performed using liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry. These results demonstrated that TAG accumulation does not necessarily proceed at the expense of galactolipid. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into pathway shifts due to five different compound treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e pathway, Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic stresses commonly used to induce oil accumulation in algae. The efficacy of these compounds also was demonstrated in three other algal species. These lipid-inducing compounds offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the biochemical mechanisms of lipid accumulation in algae and a direct means to improve algal oil content independent of the severe growth limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.</p>

Modeling of Dolichol Mass Spectra Isotopic Envelopes as a Tool to Monitor Isoprenoid Biosynthesis

Elucidation of the isoprenoid metabolic pathways is indispensable for the rational design of plant and microbial systems for the production of industrially valuable terpenoids. Here, we describe a new method, based on numerical modeling of mass spectra of metabolically labeled dolichols (Dols), designed to quantitatively follow the cooperation of MVA and MEP reprogrammed upon osmotic stress (sorbitol treatment) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The contribution of the MEP pathway increased significantly (reaching 100%) exclusively for the dominating Dols, while for long-chain Dols, the relative input of the MEP and MVA pathways remained unchanged, suggesting divergent sites of synthesis for dominating and long-chain Dols. The analysis of numerically modeled Dol mass spectra is a novel method to follow modulation of the concomitant activity of isoprenoid-generating pathways in plant cells; additionally, it suggests an exchange of isoprenoid intermediates between plastids and peroxisomes.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Connecting the Molecular Structure of Cutin to Ultrastructure and Physical Properties of the Cuticle in Petals of Arabidopsis
<p>The plant cuticle is laid down at the cell wall surface of epidermal cells in a wide variety of structures, but the functional significance of this architectural diversity is not yet understood. Here, the structure-function relationship of the petal cuticle of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was investigated. Applying Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, the cutin mutants <i>long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetase2</i> (<i>lacs2</i>), <i>permeable cuticle1 (pec1)</i>, <i>cyp77a6</i>, <i>glycerol-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e acyltransferase6</i> (<i>gpat6</i>), and <i>defective in cuticular ridges</i> (<i>dcr</i>) were grouped in three separate classes based on quantitative differences in the ν(C=O) and ν(C-H) band vibrations. These were associated mainly with the quantity of 10,16-dihydroxy hexadecanoic acid, a monomer of the cuticle polyester, cutin. These spectral features were linked to three different types of cuticle organization: a normal cuticle with nanoridges (<i>lacs2</i> and <i>pec1</i> mutants); a broad translucent cuticle (<i>cyp77a6</i> and <i>dcr</i> mutants); and an electron-opaque multilayered cuticle (<i>gpat6</i> mutant). The latter two types did not have typical nanoridges. Transmission electron microscopy revealed considerable variations in cuticle thickness in the <i>dcr</i> mutant. Different double mutant combinations showed that a low amount of C16 monomers in cutin leads to the appearance of an electron-translucent layer adjacent to the cuticle proper, which is independent of DCR action. We concluded that DCR is not only essential for incorporating 10,16-dihydroxy C16:0 into cutin but also plays a crucial role in the organization of the cuticle, independent of cutin composition. Further characterization of the mutant petals suggested that nanoridge formation and conical cell shape may contribute to the reduction of physical adhesion forces between petals and other floral organs during floral development.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e levels, oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Prognostic Value of Noninvasive Cardiovascular Testing in Patients With Stable Chest Pain
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Optimal management of patients with stable chest pain relies on the prognostic information provided by noninvasive cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing, but there are limited data from randomized trials comparing anatomic with functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain and intermediate pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> probability for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomly assigned to functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). Site-based diagnostic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> reports were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong>ed as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal. The primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalizations over a median follow-up of 26.1 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both the prevalence of normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results and incidence rate of events in these patients were significantly lower among 4500 patients randomly assigned to CTA in comparison with 4602 patients randomly assigned to functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (33.4% versus 78.0%, and 0.9% versus 2.1%, respectively; both <i>P</i><0.001). In CTA, 54.0% of events (n=74/137) occurred in patients with nonobstructive CAD (1%–69% stenosis). Prevalence of obstructive CAD and myocardial ischemia was low (11.9% versus 12.7%, respectively), with both findings having similar prognostic value (hazard ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.60–5.39; and 3.47; 95% CI, 2.42–4.99). When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> findings were stratified as mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal, hazard ratios for events in comparison with normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s increased proportionally for CTA (2.94, 7.67, 10.13; all <i>P</i><0.001) but not for corresponding functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing categories (0.94 [<i>P</i>=0.87], 2.65 [<i>P</i>=0.001], 3.88 [<i>P</i><0.001]).

Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> kit for the diagnosis of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion criteria were all clinical studies where the diagnosis   of PJI was uncertain. All studies selected used the Musculoskeletal   Infection Society (MSIS) or modified MSIS criteria. Two independent   reviewers reviewed the studies and extracted data. A meta-analysis   of results was carried out: pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive   and negative likelihood ratio, heterogeneity and areas under curves   are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ten studies (759 patients) were included. Of these, seven studies   (640 patients) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay   and three (119 patients) the lateral flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>. The pooled sensitivity   and specificity of the qualitative α-defensin laboratory immunoassay   was 0.953 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.984) and 0.965 (95%   CI 0.943 to 0.979) respectively.

Prognostic Value of Coronary Artery Calcium in the PROMISE Study (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an established predictor of future major adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals. However, limited data exist as to how CAC compares with functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (FT) in estimating prognosis in symptomatic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain (or dyspnea) and intermediate pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> probability for obstructive coronary artery disease were randomized to FT (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or anatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated those who underwent CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing as part of the anatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation (n=4209) and compared that with results of FT (n=4602). We stratified CAC and FT results as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal (for CAC: 0, 1–99 Agatston score [AS], 100–400 AS, and >400 AS, respectively; for FT: normal, mild=late positive treadmill, moderate=early positive treadmill or single-vessel ischemia, and severe=large ischemic region abnormality). The primary end point was all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization over a median follow-up of 26.1 months. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and C statistics to determine predictive and discriminatory values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, the distribution of normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results was significantly different between FT and CAC (FT: normal, n=3588 [78.0%]; mild, n=432 [9.4%]; moderate, n=217 [4.7%]; severe, n=365 [7.9%]; CAC: normal, n=1457 [34.6%]; mild, n=1340 [31.8%]; moderate, n=772 [18.3%]; severe, n=640 [15.2%]; <i>P</i><0.0001). Moderate and severe abnormalities in both arms robustly predicted events (moderate: CAC: HR, 3.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.81–5.44; and FT: HR, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–4.83; severe: CAC: HR, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.99–6.36; and FT: HR, 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 2.58–5.85). In the CAC arm, the majority of events (n=112 of 133, 84%) occurred in patients with any positive CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> (score >0), whereas fewer than half of events occurred in patients with mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal FT (n=57 of 132, 43%; <i>P</i><0.001). In contrast, any abnormality on FT was significantly more specific for predicting events (78.6% for FT versus 35.2% for CAC; <i>P</i><0.001). Overall discriminatory ability in predicting the primary end point of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina hospitalization was similar and fair for both CAC and FT (C statistic, 0.67 versus 0.64). Coronary computed tomographic angiography provided significantly better prognostic information compared with FT and CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (C index, 0.72).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among stable outpatients presenting with suspected coronary artery disease, most patients experiencing clinical events have measurable CAC at baseline, and fewer than half have any abnormalities on FT.

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often estimated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ion during a 17-year follow-up. Sodium intake was estimated with a single baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ion and the average of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed during a 1-, 5-, and 15-year follow-up. We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es. Average age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. Average 24-hour sodium excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88). However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term estimations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year average was used, respectively. Consequently, hazard ratios for cardiorenal outcome changed up to 85% with the use of sodium intake estimations from short-term (1-year) and long-term (5-year) follow-up instead of baseline estimations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Relative to a single baseline 24-hour sodium measurement, the use of subsequent 24-hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es resulted in different estimations of an individual’s sodium intake, whereas population averages remained similar. This finding had significant consequences for the association between sodium intake and long-term cardiovascular and renal outcomes.</p></sec>

Digital chemical test impresses
<p>Toxicologists this week unveiled a chemical safety <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing tool that could greatly reduce the need for six common animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s. Those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s account for nearly 60% of the estimated 3 million to 4 million animals used annually in risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing worldwide. The computerized tool—built on a massive database of molecular structures and existing safety data—appears to match, and sometimes improve on, the results of animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s for properties such as skin sensitization and eye irritation, the re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">search</span></strong>ers report in today's issue of <i>Toxicological Sciences</i>. But it also has limitations; for instance, the method can't reliably <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate a chemical's risk of causing cancer. And it's not clear how open regulatory agencies will be to adopting a nonanimal approach, although both European and U.S. regulators say they are open to the idea. Still, the big data approach is encouraging to those seeking to reduce and replace animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing.</p>

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Frequencies of Known Haplotypes from Pooled Sequence Data
<p>DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es are often pooled, either by experimental design or because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e itself is a mixture. For example, when population allele frequencies are of primary interest, individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es may be pooled together to lower the cost of sequencing. Alternatively, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e itself may be a mixture of multiple species or strains (e.g., bacterial species comprising a microbiome or pathogen strains in a blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e). We present an expectation–maximization algorithm for estimating haplotype frequencies in a pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e directly from mapped sequence reads, in the case where the possible haplotypes are known. This method is relevant to the analysis of pooled sequencing data from selection experiments, as well as the calculation of proportions of different species within a metagenomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e. Our method outperforms existing methods based on single-site allele frequencies, as well as simple approaches using sequence read data. We have implemented the method in a freely available open-source software tool.</p>

Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest that prescription rates for statins remain low in these patients. National rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the 1999 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates of self-reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% (standard error, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (standard error, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and awareness was high (>80%) among adults with definite/probable FH or severe dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [standard error, 8.2%] of adults with definite/probable FH and 37.6% [standard error, 1.2%] of adults with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest risk for lack of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to improve the frequency of cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-risk population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to close these gaps in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and treatment.</p></sec>

Ranking Businesses and Municipal Locations by Spatiotemporal Cardiac Arrest Risk to Guide Public Defibrillator Placement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to guide automated external defibrillator placement for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treatment have focused on identifying broadly defined location categories without considering hours of operation. Broad location categories may be composed of many businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating operating hours and time of OHCA occurrence may improve automated external defibrillator accessibility. We aim to identify specific businesses and municipal locations that maximize OHCA coverage on the basis of spatiotemporal assessment of OHCA risk in the immediate vicinity of franchise locations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest database. We identified all nontraumatic public OHCAs occurring in Toronto, ON, Canada, from January 2007 through December 2015. We identified 41 unique businesses and municipal location types with ≥20 locations in Toronto from the YellowPages, Canadian Franchise Association, and the City of Toronto Open Data Portal. We obtained their geographic coordinates and hours of operation from Web sites, by phone, or in person. We determined the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of each location when it was open (spatiotemporal coverage) for Toronto overall and downtown.

Outcome of the Swedish Nationwide Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Program
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A general abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing program, targeting 65-year-old men, has gradually been introduced in Sweden since 2006 and reached nationwide coverage in 2015. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of this program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data on the number of invited and examined men, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing-detected AAAs, AAAs operated on, and surgical outcome were retrieved from all 21 Swedish counties for the years 2006 through 2014. AAA-specific mortality data were retrieved from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. A linear regression analysis was used to estimate the effect on AAA-specific mortality among all men ≥65 years of age for the observed time period. The long-term effects were projected by using a validated Markov model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 302 957 men aged 65 years invited, 84% attended. The prevalence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing-detected AAA was 1.5%. After a mean of 4.5 years, 29% of patients with AAA had been operated on, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9% (1.3% after open repair and 0.3% after endovascular repair, <i>P</i><0.001). The introduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-specific mortality (mean, 4.0% per year of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing, <i>P</i>=0.020). The number needed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> and the number needed to operate on to prevent 1 premature death were 667 and 1.5, respectively. With a total population of 9.5 million, the Swedish national AAA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing program was predicted to annually prevent 90 premature deaths from AAA and to gain 577 quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-efficiency ratio was estimated to be €7770 per quality-adjusted life-years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing 65-year-old men for AAA is an effective preventive health measure and is highly cost-effective in a contemporary setting. These findings confirm the results from earlier randomized controlled trials and model studies in a large population-based setting of the importance for future healthcare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion making.</p></sec>

Geometric Morphometric Character Suites as Phylogenetic Data: Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Gastropod Shells
<p>Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many of the best represented constituents of the fossil record—including diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks—have mineralized skeletons with limited discrete characteristics, making morphological phylogenies difficult to construct. In contrast to their paucity of phylogenetic characters, the mineralized structures (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive shapes that have long proved useful for their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong>cation. The recent introduction of methodologies for including continuous data directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available characters, making it possible to produce phylogenies based, in whole or part, on continuous character data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed from such taxa. Geometric morphometric methods provide tools for accurately characterizing shape variation and can produce quantitative data that can therefore now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a nonarbitrary manner. Here, the marine gastropod genus <i>Conus</i> is used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the ability of continuous characters—generated from a geometric morphometric analysis of shell shape—to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic hypothesis constructed using molecular and morphological data. Furthermore, the ability of continuous characters derived from geometric morphometric analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete characters into a phylogeny with their extant relatives was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed by simulating the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular partition of individual extant species to produce a “cladistic pseudofossil” with only the geometric morphometric derived characters coded. The phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then compared with its placement in the total evidence tree and a symmetric re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ing tree to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the degree to which morphometric characters alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33–45% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> cases (depending upon the approach used for measuring success), it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric characters. This suggests that the incorporation of extinct <i>Conus</i> taxa into phylogenetic hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also has potential to contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions for other major components of the fossil record that lack numerous discrete characters.

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">search</span></strong>, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and network inference were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated. A comprehensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of these two parameters and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rank</span></strong>ed aggregation strategy on network performance, using libraries from 1266 maize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For network inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single networks together resulted in improved performance compared to single networks.</p>

Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis in the United Kingdom
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) infection of bones and joints accounts for   6.7% of TB cases in England, and is associated with significant   morbidity and disability. Public Health England reports that patients   with TB experience delays in diagnosis and treatment. Our aims were   to determine the demographics, presentation and investigation of   patients with a TB infection of bones and joints, to help doctors   assessing potential cases and to identify avoidable delays.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective observational study of all adults with   positive TB cultures on specimens taken at a tertiary orthopaedic   centre between June 2012 and May 2014. A laboratory information   system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">search</span></strong> identified the patients. The demographics, clinical presentation,   radiology, histopathology and key clinical dates were obtained from   medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 31 adult patients were identified. Their median age   was 37 years (interquartile range (IQR): 29 to 53); 21 (68%) were   male; 89% were migrants. The main sites affected were joints (10,   32%), the spine (8, 26%) and long bones (6, 19%); 8 (26%) had multifocal   disease. The most common presenting symptoms were pain (29/31, 94%)   and swelling (26/28, 93%). ‘Typical’ symptoms of TB, such as fever,   sweats and weight loss, were uncommon. Patients waited a median   of seven months (IQR 3 to 13.5) between the onset of symptoms and referral   to the tertiary centre and 2.3 months (IQR 1.6 to 3.4.)) between   referral and starting treatment. Radiology suggested TB in 26 (84%),   but in seven patients (23%) the initial biopsy specimens were not   sent for mycobacterial culture, necessitating a second biopsy. Rapid   Polymerase Chain Reaction-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing for TB using Xpert MTB/RIF   was performed in five patients; 4 (80%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed positive for TB.

An Evidence-Based Medicine Approach to Antihyperglycemic Therapy in Diabetes Mellitus to Overcome Overtreatment
<p>Overtreatment is pervasive in medicine and leads to potential patient harms and excessive costs in health care. Although evidence-based medicine is often derided as practice by rote algorithmic medicine, the appropriate application of key evidence-based medicine principles in clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion making is fundamental to preventing overtreatment and promoting high-value, individualized patient-centered care. Specifically, this article discusses the importance of (1) using absolute rather than relative estimates of benefits to inform treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions; (2) considering the time horizon to benefit of treatments; (3) balancing potential harms and benefits; and (4) using shared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion making by physicians to incorporate the patient’s values and preferences into treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions. Here, we illustrate the application of these principles to considering the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion of whether or not to recommend intensive glycemic control to patients to minimize microvascular and cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Through this lens, this example will illustrate how an evidence-based medicine approach can be used to individualize glycemic goals and prevent overtreatment, and can serve as a template for applying evidence-based medicine to inform treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions for other conditions to optimize health and individualize patient care.</p>

Multimodality Strategy for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment among adults without known CVD are limited by suboptimal performance and a narrow focus on only atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). We hypothesized that a strategy combining promising biomarkers across multiple different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing modalities would improve global and atherosclerotic CVD risk assessment among individuals without known CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) (n=6621) and the Dallas Heart Study (n=2202) who were free from CVD and underwent measurement of left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Associations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results with the global composite CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary or peripheral revascularization, incident heart failure, or atrial fibrillation) and ASCVD (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) were assessed over >10 years of follow-up. Multivariable analyses for the primary global CVD end point adjusted for traditional risk factors plus statin use and creatinine (base model).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> result was independently associated with global composite CVD events in MESA after adjustment for the components of the base model and the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). When the 5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s were added to the base model, the c-statistic improved from 0.74 to 0.79 (<i>P</i>=0.001), significant integrated discrimination improvement (0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.08, <i>P</i><0.001) and category free net re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong>cation improvement (0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–0.56; <i>P</i>=0.003) were observed, and the model was well calibrated (χ<sup>2</sup>=12.2, <i>P</i>=0.20). Using a simple integer score counting the number of abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s, compared with those with a score of 0, global CVD risk was increased among participants with a score of 1 (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6), 2 (hazard ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.3–4.4), 3 (hazard ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.4–6.5), and ≥4 (hazard ratio, 7.5; 95% CI, 5.2–10.6).

Point-of-Care Hemostatic Testing in Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac surgery is frequently complicated by coagulopathic bleeding that is difficult to optimally manage using standard hemostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing. We hypothesized that point-of-care hemostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm would improve the management of coagulopathy in cardiac surgery and thereby reduce blood transfusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a pragmatic multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial of a point-of-care–based transfusion algorithm in consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 12 hospitals from October 6, 2014, to May 1, 2015. Following a 1-month data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ion at all participating hospitals, a transfusion algorithm incorporating point-of-care hemostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing was sequentially implemented at 2 hospitals at a time in 1-month intervals, with the implementation order randomly assigned. No other aspects of care were modified. The primary outcome was red blood cell transfusion from surgery to postoperative day 7. Other outcomes included transfusion of other blood products, major bleeding, and major complications. The analysis adjusted for secular time trends, within-hospital clustering, and patient-level risk factors. All outcomes and analyses were prespecified before study initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 7402 patients studied, 3555 underwent surgery during the control phase and 3847 during the intervention phase.

Major bleeding occurred in 1773 (24.1%) patients, and major complications occurred in 740 (10.2%) patients. The trial intervention reduced rates of red blood cell transfusion (adjusted relative risk, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.02; number needed to treat, 24.7), platelet transfusion (relative risk, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.87; <i>P</i><0.001; number needed to treat, 16.7), and major bleeding (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.004; number needed to treat, 22.6), but had no effect on other blood product transfusions or major complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of point-of-care hemostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm reduces red blood cell transfusions, platelet transfusions, and major bleeding following cardiac surgery.

Supracellular contraction at the rear of neural crest cell groups drives collective chemotaxis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive cell chemotaxis, the directed migration of cell groups along gradients of soluble chemical cues, underlies various developmental and pathological processes. We use neural crest cells, a migratory embryonic stem cell population whose behavior has been likened to malignant invasion, to study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive chemotaxis in vivo. Studying <i>Xenopus</i> and zebrafish, we have shown that the neural crest exhibits a tensile actomyosin ring at the edge of the migratory cell group that contracts in a supracellular fashion. This contractility is polarized during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive cell chemotaxis: It is inhibited at the front but persists at the rear of the cell cluster. The differential contractility drives directed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive cell migration ex vivo and in vivo through the intercalation of rear cells. Thus, in neural crest cells, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive chemotaxis works by rear-wheel drive.</p>

Induction of CD4 T cell memory by local cellular collectivity
<p>Cell differentiation is directed by signals driving progenitors into specialized cell types. This process can involve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making, when differentiating cells determine their lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">choic</span></strong>e by interacting with each other. We used live-cell imaging in microwell arrays to study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive processes affecting differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into memory precursors. We found that differentiation of precursor memory T cells sharply increases above a threshold number of locally interacting cells. These homotypic interactions involve the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-6, which affect memory differentiation orthogonal to their effect on proliferation and survival. Mathematical modeling suggests that the differentiation rate is continuously modulated by the instantaneous number of locally interacting cells. This cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ivity can prioritize allocation of immune memory to stronger responses.</p>

We applied this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>, called CancerSEEK, to 1005 patients with nonmetastatic, clinically detected cancers of the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, lung, or breast. CancerSEEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s were positive in a median of 70% of the eight cancer types.

A worldwide survey of neonicotinoids in honey
<p>Growing evidence for global pollinator decline is causing concern for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services maintenance.

We assessed the global exposure of pollinators to neonicotinoids by analyzing 198 honey <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from across the world. We found at least one of five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed compounds (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) in 75% of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es, 45% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es contained two or more of these compounds, and 10% contained four or five.

Histopathology reveals correlative and unique phenotypes in a high-throughput mouse phenotyping screen
<p>The Mouse Genetics Project (MGP) at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute aims to generate and phenotype over 800 genetically modified mouse lines over the next 5 years to gain a better understanding of mammalian gene function and provide an invaluable resource to the scientific community for follow-up studies. Phenotyping includes the generation of a standardized biobank of paraffin-embedded tissues for each mouse line, but histopathology is not routinely performed. In collaboration with the Pathology Core of the Centre for Modeling Human Disease (CMHD) we report the utility of histopathology in a high-throughput primary phenotyping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>. Histopathology was assessed in an unbiased selection of 50 mouse lines with (<i>n</i>=30) or without (<i>n</i>=20) clinical phenotypes detected by the standard MGP primary phenotyping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>. Our findings revealed that histopathology added correlating morphological data in 19 of 30 lines (63.3%) in which the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> detected a phenotype. In addition, seven of the 50 lines (14%) presented significant histopathology findings that were not associated with or predicted by the standard primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>. Three of these seven lines had no clinical phenotype detected by the standard primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>. Incidental and strain-associated background lesions were present in all mutant lines with good concordance to wild-type controls. These findings demonstrate the complementary and unique contribution of histopathology to high-throughput primary phenotyping of mutant mice.</p>

Ventricular Fibrillation Conversion Testing After Implantation of a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), subcutaneous (S)-ICDs require a higher energy for effective defibrillation. Although ventricular fibrillation conversion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (CT) is recommended after S-ICD implantation to ensure an adequate margin between the defibrillation threshold and maximum device output (80J), prior work found that adherence to this recommendation is declining.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied first-time recipients of S-ICDs (between September 28, 2012, and April 1, 2016) in the National Cardiovascular Database Registry ICD Registry to determine predictors of use of CT, predictors of an insufficient safety margin (ISM, defined as ventricular fibrillation conversion energy >65J) during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing, and inhospital outcomes associated with use of CT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict use of CT and ISM. Inverse probability weighted logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between use of CT and inhospital adverse events including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing was performed in 70.7% (n=5624) of 7960 patients with S-ICDs. Although deferral of CT was associated with several patient characteristics (including increased body mass index, increased body surface area, severely reduced ejection fraction, dialysis dependence, warfarin use, anemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), the facility effect was comparatively more important (area under the curve for patient level versus generalized linear mixed model: 0.619 versus 0.877). An ISM occurred in 6.9% (n=336) of 4864 patients without a prior ICD and was more common among white patients and those with ventricular pacing on the preimplant ECG, higher preimplant blood pressure, larger body surface area, higher body mass index, and lower ejection fraction. A risk score was able to identify patients at low (<5%), medium (5% to 10%), and high risk (>10%) for ISM. CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing after S-ICD implantation was driven by facility preference to a greater extent than patient factors and was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications or death. ISM was relatively uncommon and is associated with several widely available patient characteristics. These data may inform ICD system selection and a targeted approach to CT.</p></sec>

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart disease mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals between PM<sub>2.5</sub> (per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) and heart disease mortality using the full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e adults, which have information on additional health variables. Interaction terms were used to examine differences in the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mortality association by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 65 936 of the full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e died during follow-up, and 22 152 died from heart disease. After adjustment for several factors, we found a significant positive association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease mortality (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.25). This association was similar in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e adults with adjustment for smoking and body mass index (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.31). Interaction terms for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic groups compared with the non-Hispanic white group were not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Using a nationally representative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e, the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease mortality was elevated and similar to previous estimates. Associations for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults were not statistically significantly different from those for non-Hispanic white adults.</p></sec>

Genetic and Functional Profiling of CD16-Dependent Natural Killer Activation Identifies Patients at Higher Risk of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an effective therapy for end-stage heart failure. Because cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of late mortality after heart transplant (HT), there is a need to identify markers that reflect inflammatory or cytotoxic immune mechanisms contributing to its onset. Noninvasive and early stratification of patients at risk remains a challenge for adapting individualized therapy. The CD16 (Fc-gamma receptor 3A [FCGR3A]) receptor was recently identified as a major determinant of antibody-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation in HT biopsies; however, little is known about the role of CD16 in promoting allograft vasculopathy. This study aimed to investigate whether markers that reflect CD16-dependent circulating NK cell activation may identify patients at higher risk of developing CAV after HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed from 103 patients undergoing routine coronarography angiography for CAV diagnosis (median 5 years since HT). Genomic and phenotypic analyses of FCGR3A/CD16 Fc-receptor profiles were compared in CAV-positive (n=52) and CAV-free patients (n=51). The levels of CD16 expression and rituximab-dependent cell cytotoxic activity of peripheral NK cells in HT recipients were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated using a noninvasive NK-cellular humoral activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enhanced levels of CD16 expression and antibody-dependent NK cell cytotoxic function of HT recipients were associated with the FCGR3A-VV genotype. The frequency of the FCGR3A-VV genotype was significantly higher in the CAV<sup>+</sup> group (odds ratio, 3.9; <i>P</i>=0.0317) than in the CAV<sup>-</sup> group. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was identified as an independent marker correlated with the presence of CAV at the time of coronary angiography by using multivariate logistic regression models. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was also identified as a baseline-independent predictor of CAV risk (odds ratio, 4.7; <i>P</i>=0.023).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study unravels a prominent role for the CD16-dependent NK cell activation pathway in the complex array of factors that favor the progression of transplant arteriosclerosis. It highlights the clinical potential of a noninvasive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of FCGR3A/CD16 in the early stratification of CAV risk. The recognition of CD16 as a major checkpoint that controls immune surveillance may promote the design of individualized NK cell–targeted therapies to limit vascular damage in highly responsive sensitized patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Systolic Blood Pressure Trajectory, Frailty, and All-Cause Mortality >80 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials show benefit from lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in people ≥80 years of age, but nonrandomized epidemiological studies suggest lower SBP may be associated with higher mortality. This study aimed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate associations of SBP with all-cause mortality by frailty category >80 years of age and to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate SBP trajectories before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health records of 144 403 participants ≥80 years of age registered with family practices in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2014. Participants were followed for ≤5 years. Clinical records of SBP were analyzed. Frailty status was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong>ed using the e-Frailty Index into the categories of fit, mild, moderate, and severe. All-cause mortality was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by frailty status and mean SBP in Cox proportional-hazards models. SBP trajectories were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated using person months as observations, with mean SBP and antihypertensive treatment status estimated for each person month. Fractional polynomial models were used to estimate SBP trajectories over 5 years before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During follow-up, 51 808 deaths occurred. Mortality rates increased with frailty level and were grea<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> at SBP <110 mm Hg. In fit women, mortality was 7.7 per 100 person years at SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg, 15.2 at SBP 110 to 119 mm Hg, and 22.7 at SBP <110 mm Hg. For women with severe frailty, rates were 16.8, 25.2, and 39.6, respectively. SBP trajectories showed an accelerated decline in the last 2 years of life. The relative odds of SBP <120 mm Hg were higher in the last 3 months of life than 5 years previously in both treated (odds ratio, 6.06; 95% confidence interval, 5.40–6.81) and untreated (odds ratio, 6.31; 95% confidence interval, 5.30–7.52) patients. There was no evidence of intensification of antihypertensive therapy in the final 2 years of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A terminal decline of SBP in the final 2 years of life suggests that nonrandomized epidemiological associations of low SBP with higher mortality may be accounted for by reverse causation if participants with lower blood pressure values are closer, on average, to the end of life.</p></sec>

Association Between Physician Follow-Up and Outcomes of Care After Chest Pain Assessment in High-Risk Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Assessment of chest pain is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits in developed countries. Although guidelines recommend primary care physician (PCP) follow-up for patients who are subsequently discharged, little is known about the relationship between physician follow-up and clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>An observational study was conducted on patients with higher baseline risk, defined as having diabetes mellitus or established cardiovascular disease, who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated for chest pain, discharged, and without adverse clinical outcomes for 30 days in Ontario from 2004 to 2010. Multivariable proportional hazard models were constructed to adjust for potential confounding between physician groups (cardiologist, PCP, or none). Among 56767 included patients, 17% were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by cardiologists, 58% were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by PCPs alone, and 25% had no physician follow-up. The mean age was 66±15 years, and 53% were male. The highest rates of diagnostic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing, medical therapy, and coronary revascularization were seen among patients treated by cardiologists. At 1 year, the rate of death or MI was 5.5% (95% confidence interval, 5.0–5.9) in the cardiology group, 7.7% (95% confidence interval, 7.4–7.9) in the PCP group, and 8.6% (95% confidence interval, 8.2–9.1) in the no-physician group.

FAK–Src signalling is important to renal collecting duct morphogenesis: discovery using a hierarchical screening technique
<p>This report describes a hierarchical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing technique for identification of pathways that control the morphogenesis of the renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ing duct system. The multi-step <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> involves a first round using a 2-dimensional, cell-line-based scrape-healing assay, then a second round using a 3-dimensional tubulogenesis assay; both of these rounds use new cell lines described in this report. The final stage is <i>ex vivo</i> organ culture. We demonstrate the utility of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> by using it to identify the FAK–Src-pathway signalling as being important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ing duct development, specifically for the cell proliferation on which this development depends.</p>

Moving without a purpose: an experimental study of swarm guidance in the Western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>
<p>During reproductive swarming, honey bee scouts perform two very important functions. Firstly, they find new nesting locations and return to the swarm cluster to communicate their discoveries. Secondly, once the swarm is ready to depart, informed scout bees act as guides, leading the swarm to its final destination. We have previously hypothesised that the two processes, selecting a new nest site and swarm guidance, are tightly linked in honey bees. When swarms can be <i>laissez faire</i> about where they nest, reaching directional consensus prior to lift off seems unnecessary. If, in contrast, it is essential that the swarm reaches a precise location, either directional consensus must be near unanimous prior to swarm departure or only a select subgroup of the scouts guide the swarm. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed experimentally whether directional consensus is necessary for the successful guidance of swarms of the Western honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i> by forcing swarms into the air prior to the completion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making process. Our results show that swarms were unable to guide themselves prior to the swarm reaching the pre-flight buzzing phase of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making process, even when directional consensus was high. We therefore suggest that not all scouts involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making process attempt to guide the swarm.</p>

The protocol   incorporated a clear set of laboratory and clinical criteria that   allowed a patient to be discharged home if all were met.

Gene Capture Coupled to High-Throughput Sequencing as a Strategy for Targeted Metagenome Exploration
<p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows faster acquisition of metagenomic data, but complete exploration of complex ecosystems is hindered by the extraordinary diversity of microorganisms. To reduce the environmental complexity, we created an innovative solution hybrid selection (SHS) method that is combined with NGS to characterize large DNA fragments harbouring biomarkers of interest. The quality of enrichment was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated after fragments containing the methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A gene (<i>mcrA</i>), the biomarker of methanogenesis, were captured from a <i>Methanosarcina</i> strain and a metagenomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e from a meromictic lake. The methanogen diversity was compared with direct metagenome and <i>mcrA</i>-based amplicon pyrosequencing strategies<i>.</i> The SHS approach resulted in the capture of DNA fragments up to 2.5 kb with an enrichment efficiency between 41 and 100%, depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e complexity. Compared with direct metagenome and amplicons sequencing, SHS detected broader <i>mcrA</i> diversity, and it allowed efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ing of the rare biosphere and unknown sequences. In contrast to amplicon-based strategies, SHS is less biased and GC independent, and it recovered complete biomarker sequences in addition to conserved regions. Because this method can also isolate the regions flanking the target sequences, it could facilitate operon reconstructions.</p>

Chronic Rejection of Cardiac Allografts Is Associated With Increased Lymphatic Flow and Cellular Trafficking
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an excellent treatment for end-stage heart disease. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reject</span></strong>ion of the donor graft, in particular, by chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reject</span></strong>ion leading to cardiac allograft vasculopathy, remains a major cause of graft loss. The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in the alloimmune response, facilitating trafficking of antigen-presenting cells to draining lymph nodes. The encounter of antigen-presenting cells with T lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs is essential for the initiation of alloimmunity. Donor lymphatic vessels are not anastomosed to that of the recipient during transplantation. The pathophysiology of lymphatic disruption is unknown, and whether this disruption enhances or hinders the alloimmune responses is unclear. Although histological analysis of lymphatic vessels in donor grafts can yield information on the structure of the lymphatics, the function following cardiac transplantation is poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography lymphoscintigraphy, we quantified the lymphatic flow index following heterotrophic cardiac transplantation in a murine model of chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reject</span></strong>ion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Ten weeks following transplantation of a minor antigen (HY) sex-mismatched heart graft, the lymphatic flow index was significantly increased in comparison with sex-matched controls. Furthermore, the enhanced lymphatic flow index correlated with an increase in donor cells in the mediastinal draining lymph nodes; increased lymphatic vessel area; and graft infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reject</span></strong>ion results in increased lymphatic flow from the donor graft to draining lymph nodes, which may be a factor in promoting cellular trafficking, alloimmunity, and cardiac allograft vasculopathy.</p></sec>

ICare-ACS (Improving Care Processes for Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to safely reduce length of stay for emergency department patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have had mixed success. Few system-wide efforts affecting multiple hospital emergency departments have ever been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated the effectiveness of a nationwide implementation of clinical pathways for potential ACS in disparate hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter pragmatic stepped-wedge before-and-after trial in 7 New Zealand acute care hospitals with 31 332 patients investigated for suspected ACS with serial troponin measurements. The implementation was a clinical pathway for the assessment of patients with suspected ACS that included a clinical pathway document in paper or electronic format, structured risk stratification, specified time points for electrocardiographic and serial troponin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing within 3 hours of arrival, and directions for combining risk stratification and electrocardiographic and troponin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing in an accelerated diagnostic protocol.

Overall, the mean 6-hour discharge rate increased from 8.3% (range, 2.7%–37.7%) to 18.4% (6.8%–43.8%). The odds of being discharged within 6 hours increased after clinical pathway implementation. The odds ratio was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.3–2.6). In patients without ACS, the median length of hospital stays decreased by 2.9 hours (95% confidence interval, 2.4–3.4). For patients discharged within 6 hours, there was no change in 30-day major adverse cardiac event rates (0.52% versus 0.44%; <i>P</i>=0.96).

Derivation and Validation of the CREST Model for Very Early Prediction of Circulatory Etiology Death in Patients Without ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction After Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No practical tool quantitates the risk of circulatory-etiology death (CED) immediately after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. We developed and validated a prediction model to rapidly determine that risk and facilitate triage to individualized treatment pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>With the use of INTCAR (International Cardiac Arrest Registry), an 87-question data set representing 44 centers in the United States and Europe, patients were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong>ed as having had CED or a combined end point of neurological-etiology death or survival. Demographics and clinical factors were modeled in a derivation cohort, and backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with CED. We demonstrated model performance using area under the curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> in the derivation and validation cohorts, and assigned a simplified point-scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 638 patients in the derivation cohort, 121 (18.9%) had CED. The final model included preexisting coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.86; confidence interval [CI], 1.83–4.49; <i>P</i>≤0.001), nonshockable rhythm (OR, 1.75; CI, 1.10–2.77; P=0.017), initial ejection fraction<30% (OR, 2.11; CI, 1.32–3.37; <i>P</i>=0.002), shock at presentation (OR, 2.27; CI, 1.42–3.62; P<0.001), and ischemic time >25 minutes (OR, 1.42; CI, 0.90–2.23; P=0.13). The derivation model area under the curve was 0.73, and Hosmer-Lemeshow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> P=0.47. Outcomes were similar in the 318-patient validation cohort (area under the curve 0.68, Hosmer-Lemeshow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> P=0.41). When assigned a point for each associated factor in the derivation model, the average predicted versus observed probability of CED with a CREST score (coronary artery disease, initial heart rhythm, low ejection fraction, shock at the time of admission, and ischemic time >25 minutes) of 0 to 5 was: 7.1% versus 10.2%, 9.5% versus 11%, 22.5% versus 19.6%, 32.4% versus 29.6%, 38.5% versus 30%, and 55.7% versus 50%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The CREST model stratified patients immediately after resuscitation according to risk of a circulatory-etiology death.

Association Between Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Blood Pressure Among Adults in the United States

Outcomes included systolic and diastolic blood pressure from the average of 3 measures and hypertension status, based on average blood pressure ≥140/90 and antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After multivariable adjustment, each 1000-mg difference in usual 24-hour sodium excretion was directly associated with systolic (4.58 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.64–6.51) and diastolic (2.25 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.83–3.67) blood pressures. Each 1000-mg difference in potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic blood pressure (–3.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, –6.01 to –1.42). Each 0.5 U difference in sodium-to-potassium ratio was directly associated with systolic blood pressure (1.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.76–2.68). Hypertension was linearly associated with progressively higher sodium and lower potassium excretion; in comparison with the lowest quartile of excretion, the adjusted odds of hypertension for the highest quartile was 4.22 (95% CI, 1.36–13.15) for sodium, and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.17–0.87) for potassium (<i>P</i><0.01 for trends).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These cross-sectional results show a strong dose-response association between urinary sodium excretion and blood pressure, and an inverse association between urinary potassium excretion and blood pressure, in a nationally representative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e of US adults.</p></sec>

Risk Factors of Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prevention of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the young remains a largely unsolved public health problem, and sports activity is an established trigger. Although the presence of standard cardiovascular risk factors in the young can link to future morbidity and mortality in adulthood, the potential contribution of these risk factors to SCA in the young has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively ascertained subjects who experienced SCA between the ages of 5 and 34 years in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area (2002–2015, catchment population ≈1 million). We assessed the circumstances, resuscitation outcomes, and clinical profile of subjects who had SCA by a detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of emergency response records, lifetime clinical records, and autopsy examinations. We specifically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated the association of standard cardiovascular risk factors and SCA, and sports as a trigger for SCA in the young.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 3775 SCAs in all age groups, 186 (5%) occurred in the young (mean age 25.9±6.8, 67% male). In SCA in the young, overall prevalence of warning signs before SCA was low (29%), and 26 (14%) were associated with sports as a trigger. The remainder (n=160) occurred in other settings categorized as nonsports. Sports-related SCAs accounted for 39% of SCAs in patients aged ≤18, 13% of SCAs in patients aged 19 to 25, and 7% of SCAs in patients aged 25 to 34. Sports-related SCA cases were more likely to present with shockable rhythms, and survival from cardiac arrest was 2.5-fold higher in sports-related versus nonsports SCA (28% versus 11%; <i>P</i>=0.05). Overall, the most common SCA-related conditions were sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (31%), coronary artery disease (22%), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (14%). There was an unexpectedly high overall prevalence of established cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking) with ≥1 risk factors in 58% of SCA cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Sports was a trigger of SCA in a minority of cases, and, in most patients, SCA occurred without warning symptoms.

Latent Rheumatic Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing echocardiography has emerged as a potentially powerful tool for early diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The utility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing echocardiography hinges on the rate of RHD progression and the ability of penicillin prophylaxis to improve outcome. We report the longitudinal outcomes of a cohort of children with latent RHD and identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective natural history study conducted under the Ugandan RHD registry. Children with latent RHD and ≥1 year of follow-up were included. All echocardiograms were re-reviewed by experts (2012 World Heart Federation criteria) for inclusion and evidence of change. Bi- and multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models, as well, were developed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">search</span></strong> for risk factors for unfavorable outcome and compare progression-free survival between those treated and not treated with penicillin. Propensity and other matching methods with sensitivity analysis were implemented for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of the penicillin effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded review confirmed 227 cases of latent RHD: 164 borderline and 63 definite (42 mild, 21 moderate/severe). Median age at diagnosis was 12 years and median follow-up was 2.3 years (interquartile range, 2.0–2.9). Penicillin prophylaxis was prescribed in 49.3% with overall adherence of 84.7%. Of children with moderate-to-severe definite RHD, 47.6% had echocardiographic progression (including 2 deaths), and 9.5% had echocardiographic regression. Children with mild definite and borderline RHD showed 26% and 9.8% echocardiographic progression and 45.2% and 46.3% echocardiographic improvement, respectively. Of those with mild definite RHD or borderline RHD, more advanced disease category, younger age, and morphological mitral valve features were risk factors for an unfavorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Latent RHD is a heterogeneous diagnosis with variable disease outcomes. Children with moderate to severe latent RHD have poor outcomes. Children with both borderline and mild definite RHD are at substantial risk of progression. Although long-term outcome remains unclear, the initial change in latent RHD may be evident during the first 1 to 2 years following diagnosis. Natural history data are inherently limited, and a randomized clinical trial is needed to definitively determine the impact of penicillin prophylaxis on the trajectory of latent RHD.</p></sec>

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22–1.69; <i>P</i>=0.34).

Disturbed Flow Promotes Arterial Stiffening Through Thrombospondin-1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Arterial stiffness and wall shear stress are powerful determinants of cardiovascular health, and arterial stiffness is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Low and oscillatory wall shear stress, termed disturbed flow (d-flow), promotes atherosclerotic arterial remodeling, but the relationship between d-flow and arterial stiffness is not well understood. The objective of this study was to define the role of d-flow on arterial stiffening and discover the relevant signaling pathways by which d-flow stiffens arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>D-flow was induced in the carotid arteries of young and old mice of both sexes. Arterial stiffness was quantified ex vivo with cylindrical biaxial mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing and in vivo from duplex ultrasound and compared with unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Gene expression and pathway analysis was performed on endothelial cell–enriched RNA and validated by immunohistochemistry. In vitro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing of signaling pathways was performed under oscillatory and laminar wall shear stress conditions. Human arteries from regions of d-flow and stable flow were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed ex vivo to validate critical results from the animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>D-flow induced arterial stiffening through collagen deposition after partial carotid ligation, and the degree of stiffening was similar to that of unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Intimal gene pathway analyses identified transforming growth factor-β pathways as having a prominent role in this stiffened arterial response, but this was attributable to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) stimulation of profibrotic genes and not changes to transforming growth factor-β. In vitro and in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing under d-flow conditions identified a possible role for TSP-1 activation of transforming growth factor-β in the upregulation of these genes. TSP-1 knockout animals had significantly less arterial stiffening in response to d-flow than wild-type carotid arteries. Human arteries exposed to d-flow had similar increases TSP-1 and collagen gene expression as seen in our model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TSP-1 has a critical role in shear-mediated arterial stiffening that is mediated in part through TSP-1’s activation of the profibrotic signaling pathways of transforming growth factor-β. Molecular targets in this pathway may lead to novel therapies to limit arterial stiffening and the progression of disease in arteries exposed to d-flow.</p></sec>

HealthLNK underestimated body mass index by 0.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% confidence interval, –0.4 to –0.1). With the use of <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</i> codes and clinical data, the sensitivity and specificity of HealthLNK queries for hypertension were 82.4% and 59.4%, for obesity were 73.0% and 89.8%, and for diabetes mellitus were 79.8% and 93.3%. In comparison with adjudicated cardiovascular events in MESA, the concordance rates for myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure were, respectively, 41.7% (5/12), 61.5% (8/13), and 62.5% (10/16).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings illustrate the limitations and strengths of electronic data repositories in comparison with information <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed by traditional standardized epidemiological approaches for the ascertainment of cardiovascular risk factors and events.</p></sec>

Sex Differences in Faculty Rank Among Academic Cardiologists in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies demonstrate that women physicians are less likely than men to be full professors. Comprehensive evidence examining whether sex differences in faculty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rank</span></strong> exist in academic cardiology, adjusting for experience and re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">search</span></strong> productivity, is lacking. Therefore, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated for sex differences in faculty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rank</span></strong> among a comprehensive, contemporary cohort of US cardiologists after adjustment for several factors that impact academic advancement, including measures of clinical experience and re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">search</span></strong> productivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified all US cardiologists with medical school faculty appointments in 2014 by using the American Association of Medical Colleges faculty roster and linked this list to a comprehensive physician database from Doximity, a professional networking website for doctors. Data on physician age, sex, years since residency, cardiology subspecialty, publications, National Institutes of Health grants, and registered clinical trials were available for all academic cardiologists. We estimated sex differences in full professorship, adjusting for these factors and medical school–specific fixed effects in a multivariable regression model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3810 cardiologists with faculty appointments in 2014 (13.3% of all US cardiologists), 630 (16.5%) were women. Women faculty were younger than men (mean age, 48.3 years versus 53.5 years, <i>P</i><0.001), had fewer total publications (mean number: 16.5 publications versus 25.2 publications; <i>P</i><0.001), were similarly likely to have National Institutes of Health funding (proportion with at least 1 National Institutes of Health award, 10.8% versus 10.4%; <i>P</i>=0.77), and were less likely to have a registered clinical trial (percentage with at least 1 clinical trial, 8.9% versus 11.1%; <i>P</i>=0.10). Among 3180 men, 973 (30.6%) were full professors in comparison with 100 (15.9%) of 630 women. In adjusted analyses, women were less likely to be full professors than men (adjusted odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.02; adjusted proportions, 22.7% versus 26.7%; absolute difference, –4.0%; 95% confidence interval, –7.5% to –0.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among cardiology faculty at US medical schools, women were less likely than men to be full professors after accounting for several factors known to influence faculty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rank</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Incident Type 2 Myocardial Infarction in a Cohort of Patients Undergoing Coronary or Peripheral Arterial Angiography
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Despite growing recognition of type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI; related to supply/demand mismatch), little is known about its risk factors or its association with outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A single-center cohort of patients undergoing coronary or peripheral angiography with or without intervention was prospectively enrolled and followed for incident type 1 and T2MI, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, peripheral arterial complication, and cardiac arrhythmia), as well. T2MI was adjudicated using criteria from the Third Universal Definition of MI. Baseline characteristics, blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es, and angiography information were obtained. Major end points subsequent to first MI were assessed using landmark analyses to compare the rates of first events only where everyone with a prior history of any MACE before MI were censored and adjusted for follow-up times. Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses with age and sex forced into all models and additional covariates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by using the stepwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">option</span></strong> for the selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One thousand two hundred fifty-one patients were enrolled and followed for a median of 3.4 years. Of these patients, 152 (12.2%) had T2MI during follow-up; T2MI was frequently recurrent. Multivariable predictors of T2MI were older age, lower systolic blood pressure, history of coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, nitrate use, and elevated concentrations of glucose, N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, and cystatin C. Patients with T2MI had higher rates of subsequent adverse events than those without T2MI (per 100 person-years: MACE, 53.7 versus 21.1, <i>P</i><0.001; all-cause death, 23.3 versus 3.3, <i>P</i><0.001; cardiovascular death, 17.5 versus 2.6, <i>P</i><0.001; heart failure events, 22.4 versus 7.4, <i>P</i><0.001); these rates are similar to those seen in patients with type 1 MI. Incident diagnosis of T2MI strongly predicted risk for subsequent MACE (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–2.48; <i>P</i><0.001), all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.96; 95% confidence interval, 2.01–4.36; <i>P</i><0.001), and cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–3.43; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>T2MI is common and associated with poor prognosis. Studies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ating treatment strategies for management of T2MI are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Left Ventricular Dysfunction Switches Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Toward an Inflammatory Phenotype and Impairs Their Reparative Properties Via Toll-Like Receptor-4
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little is known about the potentially unfavorable effects of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) activation on the heart. MSCs can respond to tissue injury by anti- or proinflammatory activation. We aimed to study the potential negative interaction between left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and MSC activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We isolated MSCs from cardiac and subcutaneous fat tissues of mice with LVD 28 days after myocardial infarction or sham operation. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the effect of LVD on MSCs, we characterized cardiac MSCs and subcutaneous MSCs in vitro. Subsequently, we injected MSCs or saline into the infarcted myocardium of mice and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated LV remodeling and function 28 days after myocardial infarction. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> the hypothesis that toll-like receptor 4 (<i>TLR4</i>) mediates proinflammatory polarization of MSCs, we characterized cardiac MSCs from <i>TLR4</i><sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type (WT) mice after inflammatory stimulation in vitro. Next, we transplanted cardiac MSCs from <i>TLR4</i><sup>-/-</sup> and WT male mice into the infarcted myocardium of female WT mice and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated infarct size, MSC retention, inflammation, remodeling, and function after 7 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>LVD switched cardiac MSCs toward an inflammatory phenotype, with increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokines. The effect of LVD on subcutaneous MSCs was less remarkable. Although transplantation of cardiac MSCs and subcutaneous MSCs from LVD and sham hearts did not improve LV remodeling and function, cardiac MSCs from LVD exacerbated anterior wall thinning 28 days after myocardial infarction. The inflammatory polarization of cardiac MSCs by LVD was mediated by <i>TLR4</i>, as we found less secretion of inflammatory cytokines and higher secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines from activated cardiac MSCs of <i>TLR4</i>-deficient mice, compared with WT cardiac MSCs. Significantly, <i>TLR4</i> deficiency preserved the expression of CD47 (don’t eat me signal) on cardiac MSCs after both <i>TLR4</i> stimulation in vitro and transplantation into the infarcted heart. Compared with WT cardiac MSCs and saline, <i>TLR4</i> <sup>-/-</sup> cardiac MSCs survived in the cardiac tissue and maintained their reparative properties, reduced infarct size, increased scar thickness, and attenuated LV dilatation 7 days after myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The environment of the failing and infarcted myocardium drives resident and transplanted MSCs toward a proinflammatory phenotype and restricts their survival and reparative effects in a mechanism mediated by <i>TLR4</i>.</p></sec>

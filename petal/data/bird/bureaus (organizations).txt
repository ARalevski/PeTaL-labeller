How Do Resuscitation Teams at Top-Performing Hospitals for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Succeed?
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is common, and outcomes vary substantially across US hospitals, but reasons for these differences are largely unknown. We set out to better understand how top-performing hospitals organize their resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s to achieve high survival rates for IHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We calculated risk-standardized IHCA survival to discharge rates across American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation registry hospitals between 2012 and 2014. We identified geographically and academically diverse hospitals in the top, middle, and bottom quartiles of survival for IHCA and performed a qualitative study that included site visits with in-depth interviews of clinical and administrative staff at 9 hospitals. With the use of thematic analysis, data were analyzed to identify salient themes of perceived performance by informants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Across 9 hospitals, we interviewed 158 individuals from multiple disciplines including physicians (17.1%), nurses (45.6%), other clinical staff (17.1%), and administration (20.3%). We identified 4 broad themes related to resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s: (1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> design, (2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> composition and roles, (3) communication and leadership during IHCA, and (4) training and education. Resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s at top-performing hospitals demonstrated the following features: dedicated or designated resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s; participation of diverse disciplines as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> members during IHCA; clear roles and responsibilities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> members; better communication and leadership during IHCA; and in-depth mock codes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s at hospitals with high IHCA survival differ from non–top-performing hospitals. Our findings suggest core elements of successful resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s that are associated with better outcomes and form the basis for future work to improve IHCA.</p></sec>

Association of Pediatric Medical Emergency Teams With Hospital Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Implementation of medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s has been identified as a potential strategy to reduce hospital deaths, because these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s respond to patients with acute physiological decline in an effort to prevent in-hospital cardiac arrest. However, prior studies of the association between medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s and hospital mortality have been limited and typically have not accounted for preimplementation mortality trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Within the Pediatric Health Information System for freestanding pediatric hospitals, annual risk-adjusted mortality rates were calculated for sites between 2000 and 2015. A random slopes interrupted time series analysis then examined whether implementation of a medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> was associated with lower-than-expected mortality rates based on preimplementation trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Across 38 pediatric hospitals, mean annual hospital admission volume was 15 854 (range, 6684–33 024), and there were a total of 1 659 059 hospitalizations preimplementation and 4 392 392 hospitalizations postimplementation. Before medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> implementation, hospital mortality decreased by 6.0% annually (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92–0.96) across all hospitals. After medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> implementation, hospital mortality continued to decrease by 6% annually (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.93–0.95), with no deepening of the mortality slope (ie, not lower OR) in comparison with the preimplementation trend, for the overall cohort (<i>P</i>=0.98) or when analyzed separately within each of the 38 study hospitals. Five years after medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> implementation across study sites, there was no difference between predicted (hospital mean of 6.18 deaths per 1000 admissions based on preimplementation trends) and actual mortality rates (hospital mean of 6.48 deaths per 1000 admissions; <i>P</i>=0.57).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s in a large sample of pediatric hospitals in the United States was not associated with a reduction in hospital mortality beyond existing preimplementation trends.</p></sec>

Quality of Care at Hospitals Identified as Outliers in Publicly Reported Mortality Statistics for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Public reporting of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes may create disincentives for physicians to provide care for critically ill patients, particularly at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions with worse clinical outcomes. We thus sought to evaluate the procedural management and in-hospital outcomes of patients treated for acute myocardial infarction before and after a hospital had been publicly identified as a negative outlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using state reports, we identified hospitals that were recognized as negative PCI outliers in 2 states (Massachusetts and New York) from 2002 to 2012. State hospitalization files were used to identify all patients with an acute myocardial infarction within these states. Procedural management and in-hospital outcomes were compared among patients treated at outlier hospitals before and after public report of outlier status. Patients at nonoutlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions were used to control for temporal trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 86 hospitals, 31 were reported as outliers for excess mortality. Outlier facilities were larger, treating more patients with acute myocardial infarction and performing more PCIs than nonoutlier hospitals (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). Among 507 672 patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized at these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions, 108 428 (21%) were treated at an outlier hospital after public report. The likelihood of PCI at outlier (relative risk [RR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.15) and nonoutlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.11–1.14) increased in a similar fashion (interaction <i>P</i>=0.50) after public report of outlier status. The likelihood of in-hospital mortality decreased at outlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81–0.85) after public report, and to a lesser degree at nonoutlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.92; interaction <i>P</i><0.001). Among patients that underwent PCI, in-hospital mortality decreased at outlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions after public recognition of outlier status in comparison with prior (RR, 0.72; 9% CI, 0.66–0.79), a decline that exceeded the reduction at nonoutlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96; interaction <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Large hospitals with higher clinical volume are more likely to be designated as negative outliers. The rates of percutaneous revascularization increased similarly at outlier and nonoutlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions after report of outlier status. After outlier designation, in-hospital mortality declined at outlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions to a greater extent than was observed at nonoutlier facilities.</p></sec>

Quantifying reputation and success in art
<p>In areas of human activity where performance is difficult to quantify in an objective fashion, reputation and networks of influence play a key role in determining access to resources and rewards. To understand the role of these factors, we reconstructed the exhibition history of half a million artists, mapping out the coexhibition network that captures the movement of art between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions. Centrality within this network captured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ional prestige, allowing us to explore the career trajectory of individual artists in terms of access to coveted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions. Early access to prestigious central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the network periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions. A Markov model predicts the career trajectory of individual artists and documents the strong path and history dependence of valuation in art.</p>

Cash for carbon: A randomized trial of payments for ecosystem services to reduce deforestation

The primary outcome was the change in land area covered by trees, measured by classifying high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that tree cover declined by 4.2% during the study period in treatment villages, compared to 9.1% in control villages. We found no evidence that enrollees shifted their deforestation to nearby land. We valued the delayed carbon dioxide emissions and found that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> benefit is 2.4 times as large as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> costs.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of the Arabidopsis Replication Timing Program
<p>Eukaryotes use a temporally regulated process, known as the replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>, to ensure that their genomes are fully and accurately duplicated during S phase. Replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s are predictive of genomic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of chromatin organization. Although replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to genome sequence and chromatin structure. We used the thymidine analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the genome-wide replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified genomic regions that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and correlated these regions with genomic features and with data for chromatin state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis chromosome arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric regions replicate late. Early and mid-replicating regions are gene-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late regions are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of chromatin states across the different times is complex, with each replication time corresponding to a mixture of states. Early and mid-replicating sequences interact with each other and not with late sequences, but early regions are more accessible than mid regions. The replication timing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite genomic organization with early/mid-replicating regions and late regions forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated largely by chromatin accessibility.</p>

SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE1 Links DNA Damage Response to Organ Regeneration
<p>In Arabidopsis, DNA damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death is limited to the meristematic stem cell niche and its early descendants. The significance of this cell-type-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death is unclear. Here, we demonstrate in roots that it is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med destruction of the mitotically compromised stem cell niche that triggers its regeneration, enabling growth recovery. In contrast to wild-type plants, <i>sog1</i> plants, which are defective in damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death, maintain the cell identities and stereotypical structure of the stem cell niche after irradiation, but these cells fail to undergo cell division, terminating root growth. We propose DNA damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death is employed by plants as a developmental response, contrasting with its role as an anticarcinogenic response in animals. This role in plants may have evolved to restore the growth of embryos after the accumulation of DNA damage in seeds.</p>

Replicating Meyerhoff for inclusive excellence in STEM
<p>Ethnic minorities comprise rapidly growing portions of the populations of most developed countries (<i>1</i>) but are underrepresented in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). Efforts to increase diversity in the STEM workforce, important for developing more effective approaches to group problem-solving (<i>4</i>–<i>6</i>), have been under way in the United States for decades, but widespread impact remains relatively low (<i>3</i>). The Meyerhoff Scholars <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> (MYS) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), provides a promising model for increasing retention and academic performance of underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates in STEM and for preparing those undergraduates to pursue and succeed in graduate and professional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>).

Multicellular Transcriptional Analysis of Mammalian Heart Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The inability of the adult mammalian heart to regenerate following injury represents a major barrier in cardiovascular medicine. In contrast, the neonatal mammalian heart retains a transient capacity for regeneration, which is lost shortly after birth. Defining the molecular mechanisms that govern regenerative capacity in the neonatal period remains a central goal in cardiac biology. Here, we assemble a transcriptomic framework of multiple cardiac cell populations during postnatal development and following injury, which enables comparative analyses of the regenerative (neonatal) versus nonregenerative (adult) state for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, leukocytes, and endothelial cells from infarcted and noninfarcted neonatal (P1) and adult (P56) mouse hearts were isolated by enzymatic dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting at day 3 following surgery. RNA sequencing was performed on these cell populations to generate the transcriptome of the major cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. To complement our transcriptomic data, we also surveyed the epigenetic landscape of cardiomyocytes during postnatal maturation by performing deep sequencing of accessible chromatin regions by using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin from purified mouse cardiomyocyte nuclei (P1, P14, and P56).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Profiling of cardiomyocyte and nonmyocyte transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s uncovered several injury-responsive genes across regenerative and nonregenerative time points. However, the majority of transcriptional changes in all cardiac cell types resulted from developmental maturation from neonatal stages to adulthood rather than activation of a distinct regeneration-specific gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>. Furthermore, adult leukocytes and fibroblasts were characterized by the expression of a proliferative gene expression network following infarction, which mirrored the neonatal state. In contrast, cardiomyocytes failed to reactivate the neonatal proliferative network following infarction, which was associated with loss of chromatin accessibility around cell cycle genes during postnatal maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work provides a comprehensive framework and transcriptional resource of multiple cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration.

TSLP signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells programs a pathogenic T helper 2 cell state
<p>Pathogenic T helper 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) cells, which produce increased amounts of the cytokines interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13, promote allergic disorders, including asthma. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine secreted by epithelial and innate immune cells, stimulates such pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 cell responses. We found that TSLP signaling in mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells initiated transcriptional changes associated with T<sub>H</sub>2 cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ming. IL-4 signaling amplified and stabilized the genomic response of T cells to TSLP, which increased the frequency of T cells producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Furthermore, the TSLP- and IL-4–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med T<sub>H</sub>2 cells had a pathogenic phenotype, producing greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 and other proinflammatory cytokines than did T<sub>H</sub>2 cells stimulated with IL-4 alone. TSLP-mediated T<sub>H</sub>2 cell induction involved distinct molecular pathways, including activation of the transcription factor STAT5 through the kinase JAK2 and repression of the transcription factor BCL6. Mice that received wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had exacerbated pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 cell responses upon exposure to house dust mites compared to mice that received TSLP receptor–deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Transient TSLP signaling stably <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med pathogenic potential in memory T<sub>H</sub>2 cells. In human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, TSLP and IL-4 promoted the generation of T<sub>H</sub>2 cells that produced greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13. Compared to healthy controls, asthmatic children showed enhancement of such T cell responses in peripheral blood. Our data support a sequential cytokine model for pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 cell differentiation and provide a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic targeting of TSLP signaling in human allergic diseases.</p>

The Washington, D.C., advocacy group White Coat Waste Project had protested the lab's killing of dozens of cats each year.

Cerebellar modulation of the reward circuitry and social behavior
<p>The cerebellum has been implicated in a number of nonmotor mental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and addiction. However, its contribution to these disorders is not well understood. In mice, we found that the cerebellum sends direct excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ions to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), one of the brain regions that processes and encodes reward. Optogenetic activation of the cerebello-VTA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ions was rewarding and, in a three-chamber social task, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ions were more active when the animal explored the social chamber. Intriguingly, activity in the cerebello-VTA pathway was required for the mice to show social preference in this task. Our data delineate a major, previously unappreciated role for the cerebellum in controlling the reward circuitry and social behavior.</p>

Commensal-specific T cell plasticity promotes rapid tissue adaptation to injury
<p>Barrier tissues are primary targets of environmental stressors and are home to the largest number of antigen-experienced lymphocytes in the body, including commensal-specific T cells. We found that skin-resident commensal-specific T cells harbor a paradoxical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> characterized by a type 17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> associated with a poised type 2 state. Thus, in the context of injury and exposure to inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-18, these cells rapidly release type 2 cytokines, thereby acquiring contextual functions. Such acquisition of a type 2 effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> promotes tissue repair. Aberrant type 2 responses can also be unleashed in the context of local defects in immunoregulation. Thus, commensal-specific T cells co-opt tissue residency and cell-intrinsic flexibility as a means to promote both local immunity and tissue adaptation to injury.</p>

A general reinforcement learning algorithm that masters chess, shogi, and Go through self-play

Emails reveal pressures on NIH gun research

The emails, written between October 2016 and February 2017, have come to light as some in Congress are pressuring NIH Director Francis Collins to renew the 3-year initiative, which has spent $18 million funding 22 research <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>s since January 2014, but which lapsed in January 2017.

LTR_retriever: A Highly Accurate and Sensitive Program for Identification of Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons
<p>Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are prevalent in plant genomes. The identification of LTR-RTs is critical for achieving high-quality gene annotation. Based on the well-conserved structure, multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s were developed for the de novo identification of LTR-RTs; however, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s are associated with low specificity and high false discovery rates. Here, we report LTR_retriever, a multithreading-empowered Perl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> that identifies LTR-RTs and generates high-quality LTR libraries from genomic sequences. LTR_retriever demonstrated significant improvements by achieving high levels of sensitivity (91%), specificity (97%), accuracy (96%), and precision (90%) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). LTR_retriever is also compatible with long sequencing reads. With 40k self-corrected PacBio reads equivalent to 4.5× genome coverage in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the constructed LTR library showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. In addition to canonical LTR-RTs with 5′-TG…CA-3′ termini, LTR_retriever also identifies noncanonical LTR-RTs (non-TGCA), which have been largely ignored in genome-wide studies. We identified seven types of noncanonical LTRs from 42 out of 50 plant genomes. The majority of noncanonical LTRs are <i>Copia</i> elements, with which the LTR is four times shorter than that of other <i>Copia</i> elements, which may be a result of their target specificity. Strikingly, non-TGCA <i>Copia</i> elements are often located in genic regions and preferentially insert nearby or within genes, indicating their impact on the evolution of genes and their potential as mutagenesis tools.</p>

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct vegetative and zygotic wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

Diversification of Root Hair Development Genes in Vascular Plants
<p>The molecular genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for root hair development has been studied intensively in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). To understand the extent to which this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> might operate in other plants, we conducted a large-scale comparative analysis of root hair development genes from diverse vascular plants, including eudicots, monocots, and a lycophyte. Combining phylogenetics and transcriptomics, we discovered conservation of a core set of root hair genes across all vascular plants, which may derive from an ancient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for unidirectional cell growth coopted for root hair development during vascular plant evolution. Interestingly, we also discovered preferential diversification in the structure and expression of root hair development genes, relative to other root hair- and root-expressed genes, among these species. These differences enabled the definition of sets of genes and gene functions that were acquired or lost in specific lineages during vascular plant evolution. In particular, we found substantial divergence in the structure and expression of genes used for root hair patterning, suggesting that the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not shared by other species. To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive view of gene expression in a single plant cell type across multiple species.</p>

<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of seed traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, seed mass is generally regarded to be key for seedling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed seed size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single seeds, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i>Seeder, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual seeds of very different sizes. The system consists of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual seeds are two-dimensional data from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ions, three-dimensional data from volumetric measures, and mass, from which seed density is also calculated. Each seed is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine seed-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating seeds of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped seeds of rapeseed, correlations between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ed area and the mass of seeds were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ions may not deliver good proxies for seed mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated seed phenotyping on a single-seed basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including seed classification, seed sorting, and assessment of seed quality.</p>

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion pattern (optic flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of optic flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as optic flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant optic flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of optic flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

Contemporary failure aetiologies of the primary, posterior-stabilised total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of revision total knee arthroplasties (TKA) that are   performed is expected to increase. However, previous reports of   the causes of failure after TKA are limited in that they report   the causes at specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ions, which are often dependent on   referral patterns. Our aim was to report the most common indications   for re-operations and revisions in a large series of posterior-stabilised   TKAs undertaken at a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">institut</span></strong>ion, excluding referrals from   elsewhere, which may bias the causes of failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 5098 TKAs which were undertaken between 2000 and 2012   were included in the study.

Impact of Regionalization of ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Care on Treatment Times and Outcomes for Emergency Medical Services–Transported Patients Presenting to Hospitals With Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Regional variations in reperfusion times and mortality in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction are influenced by differences in coordinating care between emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals. Building on the Accelerator-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>, we hypothesized that time to reperfusion could be further reduced with enhanced regional efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between April 2015 and March 2017, we worked with 12 metropolitan regions across the United States with 132 percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals and 946 EMS agencies. Data were collected in the ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network)-Get With The Guidelines Registry for quarterly Mission: Lifeline reports. The primary end point was the change in the proportion of EMS-transported patients with first medical contact to device time ≤90 minutes from baseline to final quarter. We also compared treatment times and mortality with patients treated in hospitals not participating in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong> during the corresponding time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the study period, 10 730 patients were transported to percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals, including 974 in the baseline quarter and 972 in the final quarter who met inclusion criteria. Median age was 61 years; 27% were women, 6% had cardiac arrest, and 6% had shock on admission; 10% were black, 12% were Latino, and 10% were uninsured. By the end of the intervention, all process measures reflecting coordination between EMS and hospitals had improved, including the proportion of patients with a first medical contact to device time of ≤90 minutes (67%–74%; <i>P</i><0.002), a first medical contact to device time to catheterization laboratory activation of ≤20 minutes (38%–56%; <i>P</i><0.0001), and emergency department dwell time of ≤20 minutes (33%–43%; <i>P</i><0.0001). Of the 12 regions, 9 regions reduced first medical contact to device time, and 8 met or exceeded the national goal of 75% of patients treated in ≤90 minutes.

Histone Methyltransferase G9a Is Required for Cardiomyocyte Homeostasis and Hypertrophy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Correct gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ming of the cardiomyocyte underlies the normal functioning of the heart. Alterations to this can lead to the loss of cardiac homeostasis, triggering heart dysfunction. Although the role of some histone methyltransferases in establishing the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> of postnatal cardiomyocytes during heart development has been shown, the function of this class of epigenetic enzymes is largely unexplored in the adult heart. In this study, we investigated the role of G9a/Ehmt2, a histone methyltransferase that defines a repressive epigenetic signature, in defining the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> for cardiomyocyte homeostasis and cardiac hypertrophy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the function of G9a in normal and stressed cardiomyocytes with the use of a conditional, cardiac-specific G9a knockout mouse, a specific G9a inhibitor, and high-throughput approaches for the study of the epigenome (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) and transcriptome (RNA sequencing); traditional methods were used to assess cardiac function and cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that G9a is required for cardiomyocyte homeostasis in the adult heart by mediating the repression of key genes regulating cardiomyocyte function via dimethylation of H3 lysine 9 and interaction with enhancer of zeste homolog 2, the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2, and MEF2C-dependent gene expression by forming a complex with this transcription factor. The G9a-MEF2C complex was found to be required also for the maintenance of heterochromatin needed for the silencing of developmental genes in the adult heart. Moreover, G9a promoted cardiac hypertrophy by repressing antihypertrophic genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Taken together, our findings demonstrate that G9a orchestrates critical epigenetic changes in cardiomyocytes in physiological and pathological conditions, thereby providing novel therapeutic avenues for cardiac pathologies associated with dysregulation of these mechanisms.</p></sec>

Ventral CA1 neurons store social memory
<p>The medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, has been implicated in social memory. However, it remains unknown which parts of these brain regions and their circuits hold social memory. Here, we show that ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) neurons of a mouse and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ions to nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell play a necessary and sufficient role in social memory. Both the proportion of activated vCA1 cells and the strength and stability of the responding cells are greater in response to a familiar mouse than to a previously unencountered mouse. Optogenetic reactivation of vCA1 neurons that respond to the familiar mouse enabled memory retrieval and the association of these neurons with unconditioned stimuli.

Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse polar behaviors in response to directional and nondirectional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic behaviors is well understood, but it is less well understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the polarity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med polarity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in polarization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf polarity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and polar transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of polar auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

A Program for Iron Economy during Deficiency Targets Specific Fe Proteins
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plants, utilized in nearly every cellular process. Because the adjustment of uptake under Fe limitation cannot satisfy all demands, plants need to acclimate their physiology and biochemistry, especially in their chloroplasts, which have a high demand for Fe. To investigate if a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> exists for the utilization of Fe under deficiency, we analyzed how hydroponically grown Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) adjusts its physiology and Fe protein composition in vegetative photosynthetic tissue during Fe deficiency. Fe deficiency first affected photosynthetic electron transport with concomitant reductions in carbon assimilation and biomass production when effects on respiration were not yet significant. Photosynthetic electron transport function and protein levels of Fe-dependent enzymes were fully recovered upon Fe resupply, indicating that the Fe depletion stress did not cause irreversible secondary damage. At the protein level, ferredoxin, the cytochrome-<i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, and Fe-containing enzymes of the plastid sulfur assimilation pathway were major targets of Fe deficiency, whereas other Fe-dependent functions were relatively less affected. In coordination, SufA and SufB, two proteins of the plastid Fe-sulfur cofactor assembly pathway, were also diminished early by Fe depletion. Iron depletion reduced mRNA levels for the majority of the affected proteins, indicating that loss of enzyme was not just due to lack of Fe cofactors. SufB and ferredoxin were early targets of transcript down-regulation. The data reveal a hierarchy for Fe utilization in photosynthetic tissue and indicate that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> is in place to acclimate to impending Fe deficiency.</p>

Dynamic Cytology and Transcriptional Regulation of Rice Lamina Joint Development
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) leaf angle is determined by lamina joint and is an important agricultural trait determining leaf erectness and, hence, the photosynthesis efficiency and grain yield. Genetic studies reveal a complex regulatory network of lamina joint development; however, the morphological changes, cytological transitions, and underlying transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ming remain to be elucidated. A systemic morphological and cytological study reveals a dynamic developmental process and suggests a common but distinct regulation of the lamina joint. Successive and sequential cell division and expansion, cell wall thickening, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death at the adaxial or abaxial sides form the cytological basis of the lamina joint, and the increased leaf angle results from the asymmetric cell proliferation and elongation. Analysis of the gene expression profiles at four distinct developmental stages ranging from initiation to senescence showed that genes related to cell division and growth, hormone synthesis and signaling, transcription (transcription factors), and protein phosphorylation (protein kinases) exhibit distinct spatiotemporal patterns during lamina joint development. Phytohormones play crucial roles by promoting cell differentiation and growth at early stages or regulating the maturation and senescence at later stages, which is consistent with the quantitative analysis of hormones at different stages. Further comparison with the gene expression profile of <i>leaf inclination1</i>, a mutant with decreased auxin and increased leaf angle, indicates the coordinated effects of hormones in regulating lamina joint. These results reveal a dynamic cytology of rice lamina joint that is fine-regulated by multiple factors, providing informative clues for illustrating the regulatory mechanisms of leaf angle and plant architecture.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete fertility of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>ed cell death , producing fertile gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive barriers.</p>

MAP Kinase PrMPK9-1 Contributes to the Self-Incompatibility Response
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) form important signaling modules for a variety of cellular responses in eukaryotic cells. In plants, MAPKs play key roles in growth and development as well as in immunity/stress responses. Pollen-pistil interactions are critical early events regulating pollination and fertilization and involve many signaling events. Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism to prevent self-fertilization and inbreeding in higher plants and also is known to utilize signaling to achieve incompatible pollen rejection. Although several pollen-expressed MAPKs exist, very little is known about their function. We previously identified a pollen-expressed MAPK (p56) from <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> that was rapidly activated during SI; several studies implicated its role in signaling to SI-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death involving a DEVDase. However, to date, the identity of the MAPK involved has been unknown. Here, we have identified and cloned a pollen-expressed <i>P. rhoeas</i> threonine-aspartate-tyrosine (TDY) MAPK, <i>PrMPK9-1</i>. Rather few data relating to the function of TDY MAPKs in plants currently exist. We provide evidence that <i>PrMPK9-1</i> has a cell type-specific function, with a distinct role from <i>AtMPK9</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first study implicating a function for a TDY MAPK in pollen. We show that PrMPK9-1 corresponds to p56 and demonstrate that it is functionally involved in mediating SI in <i>P. rhoeas</i> pollen: PrMPK9-1 is a key regulator for SI in pollen and acts upstream of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death involving actin and activation of a DEVDase. Our study provides an important advance in elucidating functional roles for this class of MAPKs.</p>

Understanding and Manipulating Meiotic Recombination in Plants
<p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of chromosomes, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is homologous recombination, which promotes homologous pairing and generates crossovers (COs) to connect homologous chromosomes until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on chromosomes. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per chromosome pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of chromosome size. Moreover, their positions are not random on chromosomes but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the generation of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.</p>

A Subset of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes Is Essential for Plant Immunity
<p>Of the three classes of enzymes involved in ubiquitination, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) have been often incorrectly considered to play merely an auxiliary role in the process, and few E2 enzymes have been investigated in plants. To reveal the role of E2 in plant innate immunity, we identified and cloned 40 tomato genes encoding ubiquitin E2 proteins. Thioester assays indicated that the majority of the genes encode enzymatically active E2. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 40 tomato E2 enzymes into 13 groups, of which members of group III were found to interact and act specifically with AvrPtoB, a <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> effector that uses its ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity to suppress host immunity. Knocking down the expression of group III E2 genes in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> diminished the AvrPtoB-promoted degradation of the Fen kinase and the AvrPtoB suppression of host immunity-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death. Importantly, silencing group III E2 genes also resulted in reduced pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). By contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death induced by several effector-triggered immunity elicitors was not affected on group III-silenced plants. Functional characterization suggested redundancy among group III members for their role in the suppression of plant immunity by AvrPtoB and in PTI and identified UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING11 (UBC11), UBC28, UBC29, UBC39, and UBC40 as playing a more significant role in PTI than other group III members. Our work builds a foundation for the further characterization of E2s in plant immunity and reveals that AvrPtoB has evolved a strategy for suppressing host immunity that is difficult for the plant to thwart.</p>

Phytoglobins Improve Hypoxic Root Growth by Alleviating Apical Meristem Cell Death
<p>Hypoxic root growth in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is influenced by the expression of phytoglobins (<i>ZmPgbs</i>). Relative to the wild type, suppression of <i>ZmPgb1.1</i> or <i>ZmPgb1.2</i> inhibits the growth of roots exposed to 4% oxygen, causing structural abnormalities in the root apical meristems. These effects were accompanied by increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), possibly through the transcriptional induction of four <i>Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs</i>. TUNEL-positive nuclei in meristematic cells indicated the involvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>med cell death (PCD) in the process. These cells also accumulated nitric oxide and stained heavily for ethylene biosynthetic transcripts. A sharp increase in the expression level of several 1-aminocyclopropane synthase (<i>ZmAcs2</i>, <i>ZmAcs6</i>, and <i>ZmAcs7</i>), 1-aminocyclopropane oxidase (<i>Aco15</i>, <i>Aco20</i>, <i>Aco31</i>, and <i>Aco35</i>), and ethylene-responsive (<i>ZmErf2</i> and <i>ZmEbf1</i>) genes was observed in hypoxic <i>ZmPgb</i>-suppressing roots, which overproduced ethylene. Inhibiting ROS synthesis with diphenyleneiodonium or ethylene perception with 1-methylcyclopropene suppressed PCD, increased <i>BAX inhibitor-1</i>, an effective attenuator of the death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s in eukaryotes, and restored root growth. Hypoxic roots overexpressing <i>ZmPgbs</i> had the lowest level of ethylene and showed a reduction in ROS staining and TUNEL-positive nuclei in the meristematic cells. These roots retained functional meristems and exhibited the highest growth performance when subjected to hypoxic conditions. Collectively, these results suggest a novel function of Pgbs in protecting root apical meristems from hypoxia-induced PCD through mechanisms initiated by nitric oxide and mediated by ethylene via ROS.</p>

TCS: A New Multiple Sequence Alignment Reliability Measure to Estimate Alignment Accuracy and Improve Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
<p>Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a key modeling procedure when analyzing biological sequences. Homology and evolutionary modeling are the most common applications of MSAs. Both are known to be sensitive to the underlying MSA accuracy. In this work, we show how this problem can be partly overcome using the transitive consistency score (TCS), an extended version of the T-Coffee scoring scheme. Using this local evaluation function, we show that one can identify the most reliable portions of an MSA, as judged from BAliBASE and PREFAB structure-based reference alignments. We also show how this measure can be used to improve phylogenetic tree reconstruction using both an established simulated data set and a novel empirical yeast data set. For this purpose, we describe a novel lossless alternative to site filtering that involves overweighting the trustworthy columns. Our approach relies on the T-Coffee framework; it uses libraries of pairwise alignments to evaluate any third party MSA. Pairwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ions can be produced using fast or slow methods, thus allowing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. We compared TCS with Heads-or-Tails, GUIDANCE, Gblocks, and trimAl and found it to lead to significantly better estimates of structural accuracy and more accurate phylogenetic trees.

Heterochronic Meiotic Misexpression in an Interspecific Yeast Hybrid
<p>Regulatory changes rapidly accumulate between species, and interspecific hybrids often misexpress genes. Hybrid misexpression, expression levels outside the range of both parental species, can result from <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-acting regulatory changes that interact abnormally in hybrids. Thus, misexpressed genes may contribute to hybrid sterility. However, in the context of a whole organism, misexpression may not result directly from <i>cis–trans</i> interactions but rather indirectly from differences between hybrid and parental abundance of cell types. Here we eliminate the confounding effects of cell types by examining gene expression in a sterile interspecific yeast hybrid during meiosis. We investigated gene expression of the yeasts <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>S. paradoxus</i>, and their hybrid at multiple meiotic stages. Although the hybrid and parents exhibit similar changes in expression levels across meiosis, the hybrid meiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> occurs earlier than either parent. The timing change produces a heterochronic pattern of misexpression during midmeiosis. Coincident with the timing of misexpression, we find a transition from predominantly <i>trans</i>-acting to <i>cis-</i>acting expression divergence and an increase in the number of opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes. However, we find no direct relationship between opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes and misexpression. Contrary to the notion that <i>cis–trans</i> interactions cause misexpression, a heterochronic shift in the normal meiotic gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> produces patterns of misexpression in an yeast hybrid. Our results imply that temporal dynamics of single cell types is important to understanding hybrid misexpression and its relationship to <i>cis–trans</i> interactions.</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong> MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>s, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from <ext-link>www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   rotation, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">program</span></strong>. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral rotation and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ion on to the tibial   plateau. This method evaluates the femur medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   rotation. When sitting cross-legged, femurs displayed internal rotation   from 10° to 100°. From 100°, femoral external rotation was observed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was observed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The measure kinematic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial pivoting pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°. During   kneeling, a medial pivot pattern was evident. When sitting cross-legged,   a lateral pivot pattern was seen from 0° to 100°, and a medial pivot   pattern beyond 100°.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The kinematics of normal knees during high flexion are variable   according to activity. Nevertheless, our study was limited to a   small number of male patients using a different technique to report   the kinematics than previous publications. Accordingly, caution   should be observed in generalizing our findings.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:50–5.</p></sec>

Histopathology reveals correlative and unique phenotypes in a high-throughput mouse phenotyping screen
<p>The Mouse Genetics Project (MGP) at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute aims to generate and phenotype over 800 genetically modified mouse lines over the next 5 years to gain a better understanding of mammalian gene function and provide an invaluable resource to the scientific community for follow-up studies. Phenotyping includes the generation of a standardized biobank of paraffin-embedded tissues for each mouse line, but histopathology is not routinely performed. In collaboration with the Pathology Core of the Centre for Modeling Human Disease (CMHD) we report the utility of histopathology in a high-throughput primary phenotyping screen. Histopathology was assessed in an unbiased selection of 50 mouse lines with (<i>n</i>=30) or without (<i>n</i>=20) clinical phenotypes detected by the standard MGP primary phenotyping screen. Our findings revealed that histopathology added correlating morphological data in 19 of 30 lines (63.3%) in which the primary screen detected a phenotype. In addition, seven of the 50 lines (14%) presented significant histopathology findings that were not associated with or predicted by the standard primary screen. Three of these seven lines had no clinical phenotype detected by the standard primary screen. Incidental and strain-associated background lesions were present in all mutant lines with good concordance to wild-type controls. These findings demonstrate the complementary and unique contribution of histopathology to high-throughput primary phenotyping of mutant mice.</p>

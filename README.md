# PeTaL (Periodic Table of Life)

The Periodic Table of Life (PeTaL, pronounced petal) is intended to be a design tool to enable a deeper understanding of natural systems and to enable the creation or improvement of nature-inspired systems. The tool includes an unstructured database, data analytics tools and a web-based user interface. Three levels of information are expected to be captured: morphology that would aid designers by providing context-specific physical design rules, function-morphology relationships to provide nature-inspired solution strategies, and system-level relationships that involve the interaction of several biological models including flow of resources and energy. In its current form, PeTaL is structured as a large `neo4j` database, accessible to researchers and citizen scientists. It includes data on every living species.

## Getting Started
